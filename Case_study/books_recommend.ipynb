These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of\\nspecies--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our\\ngreatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that\\nsomething might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently\\naccumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have\\nany bearing on it. After five years\\' work I allowed myself to speculate on\\nthe subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into a\\nsketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from that\\nperiod to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object. I hope\\nthat I may be excused for entering on these personal details, as I give\\nthem to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a decision.\\n\\nMy work is now nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three more\\nyears to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have been\\nurged to publish this Abstract. I have more especially been induced to do\\nthis, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the {2} natural history of the\\nMalay archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general\\nconclusions that I have on the origin of species. Last year he sent me a\\nmemoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward it to Sir\\nCharles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is published in\\nthe third volume of the Journal of that Society. Sir C. Lyell and Dr.\\nHooker, who both knew of my work--the latter having read my sketch of\\n1844--honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with Mr. Wallace\\'s\\nexcellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts.\\n\\nThis Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I cannot\\nhere give references and authorities for my several statements; and I must\\ntrust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy. No doubt\\nerrors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been cautious in\\ntrusting to good authorities alone. I can here give only the general\\nconclusions at which I have arrived, with a few facts in illustration, but\\nwhich, I hope, in most cases will suffice. No one can feel more sensible\\nthan I do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts,\\nwith references, on which my conclusions have been grounded; and I hope in\\na future work to do this. For I am well aware that scarcely a single point\\nis discussed in this volume on which facts cannot be adduced, often\\napparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which I\\nhave arrived. A fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and\\nbalancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question; and this\\ncannot possibly be here done.\\n\\nI much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of\\nacknowledging the generous assistance which I have received from very many\\nnaturalists, some of them personally unknown to me. I cannot, however, {3}\\nlet this opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to Dr.\\nHooker, who for the last fifteen years has aided me in every possible way\\nby his large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment.\\n\\nIn considering the Origin of Species, it is quite conceivable that a\\nnaturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their\\nembryological relations, their geographical distribution, geological\\nsuccession, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that each\\nspecies had not been independently created, but had descended, like\\nvarieties, from other species. Nevertheless, such a conclusion, even if\\nwell founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it could be shown how the\\ninnumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified, so as to\\nacquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly\\nexcites our admiration. Naturalists continually refer to external\\nconditions, such as climate, food, &c., as the only possible cause of\\nvariation. In one very limited sense, as we shall hereafter see, this may\\nbe true; but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions,\\nthe structure, for instance, of the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak,\\nand tongue, so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees.\\nIn the case of the misseltoe, which draws its nourishment from certain\\ntrees, which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which\\nhas flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain\\ninsects to bring pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally\\npreposterous to account for the structure of this parasite, with its\\nrelations to several distinct organic beings, by the effects of external\\nconditions, or of habit, or of the volition of the plant itself.\\n\\nThe author of the \\'Vestiges of Creation\\' would, I presume, say that, after\\na certain unknown number of {4} generations, some bird had given birth to a\\nwoodpecker, and some plant to the missletoe, and that these had been\\nproduced perfect as we now see them; but this assumption seems to me to be\\nno explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic\\nbeings to each other and to their physical conditions of life, untouched\\nand unexplained.\\n\\nIt is, therefore, of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into\\nthe means of modification and coadaptation. At the commencement of my\\nobservations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated\\nanimals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out\\nthis obscure problem. Nor have I been disappointed; in this and in all\\nother perplexing cases I have invariably found that our knowledge,\\nimperfect though it be, of variation under domestication, afforded the best\\nand safest clue. I may venture to express my conviction of the high value\\nof such studies, although they have been very commonly neglected by\\nnaturalists.\\n\\nFrom these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this\\nAbstract to Variation under Domestication. We shall thus see that a large\\namount of hereditary modification is at least possible; and, what is\\nequally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of man in\\naccumulating by his Selection successive slight variations. I will then\\npass on to the variability of species in a state of nature; but I shall,\\nunfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly, as it\\ncan be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts. We shall,\\nhowever, be enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to\\nvariation. In the next chapter the Struggle for Existence amongst all\\norganic beings throughout the world, which inevitably follows from the high\\ngeometrical ratio of their {5} increase, will be treated of. This is the\\ndoctrine of Malthus, applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms. As\\nmany more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive;\\nand as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for\\nexistence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any\\nmanner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying\\nconditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be\\n_naturally selected_. From the strong principle of inheritance, any\\nselected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.\\n\\nThis fundamental subject of Natural Selection will be treated at some\\nlength in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how Natural Selection\\nalmost inevitably causes much Extinction of the less improved forms of\\nlife, and leads to what I have called Divergence of Character. In the next\\nchapter I shall discuss the complex and little known laws of variation and\\nof correlation of growth. In the four succeeding chapters, the most\\napparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will be given: namely,\\nfirst, the difficulties of transitions, or in understanding how a simple\\nbeing or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly\\ndeveloped being or elaborately constructed organ; secondly, the subject of\\nInstinct, or the mental powers of animals; thirdly, Hybridism, or the\\ninfertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed;\\nand fourthly, the imperfection of the Geological Record. In the next\\nchapter I shall consider the geological succession of organic beings\\nthroughout time; in the eleventh and twelfth, their geographical\\ndistribution throughout space; in the thirteenth, their classification or\\nmutual affinities, both when mature and in an embryonic condition. In the\\nlast chapter I shall give a {6} brief recapitulation of the whole work, and\\na few concluding remarks.\\n\\nNo one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in\\nregard to the origin of species and varieties, if he makes due allowance\\nfor our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of all the\\nbeings which live around us. Who can explain why one species ranges widely\\nand is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow range and\\nis rare? Yet these relations are of the highest importance, for they\\ndetermine the present welfare, and, as I believe, the future success and\\nmodification of every inhabitant of this world. Still less do we know of\\nthe mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the\\nmany past geological epochs in its history. Although much remains obscure,\\nand will long remain obscure, I can entertain no doubt, after the most\\ndeliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the\\nview which most naturalists entertain, and which I formerly\\nentertained--namely, that each species has been independently created--is\\nerroneous. I am fully convinced that species are not immutable; but that\\nthose belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants\\nof some other and generally extinct species, in the same manner as the\\nacknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that\\nspecies. Furthermore, I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the\\nmain but not exclusive means of modification.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{7}\\n\\nCHAPTER I.\\n\\nVARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION.\\n\\n    Causes of Variability--Effects of Habit--Correlation of\\n    Growth--Inheritance--Character of Domestic Varieties--Difficulty of\\n    distinguishing between Varieties and Species--Origin of Domestic\\n    Varieties from one or more Species--Domestic Pigeons, their Differences\\n    and Origin--Principle of Selection anciently followed, its\\n    Effects--Methodical and Unconscious Selection--Unknown Origin of our\\n    Domestic Productions--Circumstances favourable to Man\\'s power of\\n    Selection.\\n\\nWhen we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our\\nolder cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes\\nus, is, that they generally differ more from each other than do the\\nindividuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. When we\\nreflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been\\ncultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different\\nclimates and treatment, I think we are driven to conclude that this great\\nvariability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised\\nunder conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from,\\nthose to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature. There is\\nalso, I think, some probability in the view propounded by Andrew Knight,\\nthat this variability may be partly connected with excess of food. It seems\\npretty clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations\\nto the new conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation;\\nand that when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally\\ncontinues to vary for many generations. {8} No case is on record of a\\nvariable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation. Our oldest\\ncultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our\\noldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or\\nmodification.\\n\\nIt has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability,\\nwhatever they may be, generally act; whether during the early or late\\nperiod of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception.\\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire\\'s experiments show that unnatural treatment of the\\nembryo causes monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be separated by any\\nclear line of distinction from mere variations. But I am strongly inclined\\nto suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to\\nthe male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the\\nact of conception. Several reasons make me believe in this; but the chief\\none is the remarkable effect which confinement or cultivation has on the\\nfunction of the reproductive system; this system appearing to be far more\\nsusceptible than any other part of the organisation, to the action of any\\nchange in the conditions of life. Nothing is more easy than to tame an\\nanimal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under\\nconfinement, even in the many cases when the male and female unite. How\\nmany animals there are which will not breed, though living long under not\\nvery close confinement in their native country! This is generally\\nattributed to vitiated instincts; but how many cultivated plants display\\nthe utmost vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! In some few such cases it\\nhas been discovered that very trifling changes, such as a little more or\\nless water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether or\\nnot the plant sets a seed. I cannot here enter on the copious details which\\nI have collected on {9} this curious subject; but to show how singular the\\nlaws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, I\\nmay just mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in\\nthis country pretty freely under confinement, with the exception of the\\nplantigrades or bear family; whereas carnivorous birds, with the rarest\\nexceptions, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have pollen\\nutterly worthless, in the same exact condition as in the most sterile\\nhybrids. When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants,\\nthough often weak and sickly, yet breeding quite freely under confinement;\\nand when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a\\nstate of nature, perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could\\ngive numerous instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously\\naffected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting, we need not be\\nsurprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting not\\nquite regularly, and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents.\\n\\nSterility has been said to be the bane of horticulture; but on this view we\\nowe variability to the same cause which produces sterility; and variability\\nis the source of all the choicest productions of the garden. I may add,\\nthat as some organisms will breed freely under the most unnatural\\nconditions (for instance, the rabbit and ferret kept in hutches), showing\\nthat their reproductive system has not been thus affected; so will some\\nanimals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very\\nslightly--perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.\\n\\nA long list could easily be given of \"sporting plants;\" by this term\\ngardeners mean a single bud or offset, which suddenly assumes a new and\\nsometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant. {10}\\nSuch buds can be propagated by grafting, &c., and sometimes by seed. These\\n\"sports\" are extremely rare under nature, but far from rare under\\ncultivation; and in this case we see that the treatment of the parent has\\naffected a bud or offset, and not the ovules or pollen. But it is the\\nopinion of most physiologists that there is no essential difference between\\na bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation; so that, in fact,\\n\"sports\" support my view, that variability may be largely attributed to the\\novules or pollen, or to both, having been affected by the treatment of the\\nparent prior to the act of conception. These cases anyhow show that\\nvariation is not necessarily connected, as some authors have supposed, with\\nthe act of generation.\\n\\nSeedlings from the same fruit, and the young of the same litter, sometimes\\ndiffer considerably from each other, though both the young and the parents,\\nas MГјller has remarked, have apparently been exposed to exactly the same\\nconditions of life; and this shows how unimportant the direct effects of\\nthe conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of reproduction, of\\ngrowth, and of inheritance; for had the action of the conditions been\\ndirect, if any of the young had varied, all would probably have varied in\\nthe same manner. To judge how much, in the case of any variation, we should\\nattribute to the direct action of heat, moisture, light, food, &c., is most\\ndifficult: my impression is, that with animals such agencies have produced\\nvery little direct effect, though apparently more in the case of plants.\\nUnder this point of view, Mr. Buckman\\'s recent experiments on plants are\\nextremely valuable. When all or nearly all the individuals exposed to\\ncertain conditions are affected in the same way, the change at first\\nappears to be directly due to such conditions; but in some cases it can be\\nshown that quite opposite conditions produce {11} similar changes of\\nstructure. Nevertheless some slight amount of change may, I think, be\\nattributed to the direct action of the conditions of life--as, in some\\ncases, increased size from amount of food, colour from particular kinds of\\nfood or from light, and perhaps the thickness of fur from climate.\\n\\nHabit also has a decided influence, as in the period of flowering with\\nplants when transported from one climate to another. In animals it has a\\nmore marked effect; for instance, I find in the domestic duck that the\\nbones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion\\nto the whole skeleton, than do the same bones in the wild-duck; and I\\npresume that this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck\\nflying much less, and walking more, than its wild parent. The great and\\ninherited development of the udders in cows and goats in countries where\\nthey are habitually milked, in comparison with the state of these organs in\\nother countries, is another instance of the effect of use. Not a single\\ndomestic animal can be named which has not in some country drooping ears;\\nand the view suggested by some authors, that the drooping is due to the\\ndisuse of the muscles of the ear, from the animals not being much alarmed\\nby danger, seems probable.\\n\\nThere are many laws regulating variation, some few of which can be dimly\\nseen, and will be hereafter briefly mentioned. I will here only allude to\\nwhat may be called correlation of growth. Any change in the embryo or larva\\nwill almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal. In\\nmonstrosities, the correlations between quite distinct parts are very\\ncurious; and many instances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire\\'s\\ngreat work on this subject. Breeders believe that long limbs are almost\\nalways accompanied by an elongated head. Some instances of correlation are\\nquite whimsical: thus {12} cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf; colour\\nand constitutional peculiarities go together, of which many remarkable\\ncases could be given amongst animals and plants. From the facts collected\\nby Heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs are differently affected\\nfrom coloured individuals by certain vegetable poisons. Hairless dogs have\\nimperfect teeth: long-haired and coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as\\nis asserted, long or many horns; pigeons with feathered feet have skin\\nbetween their outer toes; pigeons with short beaks have small feet, and\\nthose with long beaks large feet. Hence, if man goes on selecting, and thus\\naugmenting, any peculiarity, he will almost certainly unconsciously modify\\nother parts of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of the\\ncorrelation of growth.\\n\\nThe result of the various, quite unknown, or dimly seen laws of variation\\nis infinitely complex and diversified. It is well worth while carefully to\\nstudy the several treatises published on some of our old cultivated plants,\\nas on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, &c.; and it is really\\nsurprising to note the endless points in structure and constitution in\\nwhich the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly from each other. The\\nwhole organisation seems to have become plastic, and tends to depart in\\nsome small degree from that of the parental type.\\n\\nAny variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. But the number\\nand diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight\\nand those of considerable physiological importance, is endless. Dr. Prosper\\nLucas\\'s treatise, in two large volumes, is the fullest and the best on this\\nsubject. No breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance: like\\nproduces like is his fundamental belief: doubts have been thrown on this\\nprinciple by theoretical writers alone. When any deviation of structure\\noften appears, and we see it in the {13} father and child, we cannot tell\\nwhether it may not be due to the same cause having acted on both; but when\\namongst individuals, apparently exposed to the same conditions, any very\\nrare deviation, due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances,\\nappears in the parent--say, once amongst several million individuals--and\\nit reappears in the child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us\\nto attribute its reappearance to inheritance. Every one must have heard of\\ncases of albinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, &c., appearing in several\\nmembers of the same family. If strange and rare deviations of structure are\\ntruly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely\\nadmitted to be inheritable. Perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole\\nsubject, would be, to look at the inheritance of every character whatever\\nas the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly.\\n\\nThe laws governing inheritance are quite unknown; no one can say why a\\npeculiarity in different individuals of the same species, or in individuals\\nof different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so; why the\\nchild often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or grandmother\\nor other more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from\\none sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone, more commonly but not\\nexclusively to the like sex. It is a fact of some little importance to us,\\nthat peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often\\ntransmitted either exclusively, or in a much greater degree, to males\\nalone. A much more important rule, which I think may be trusted, is that,\\nat whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears, it tends to appear\\nin the offspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier. In many\\ncases this could not be otherwise: thus the inherited peculiarities in the\\nhorns of cattle could appear only in {14} the offspring when nearly mature;\\npeculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the corresponding\\ncaterpillar or cocoon stage. But hereditary diseases and some other facts\\nmake me believe that the rule has a wider extension, and that when there is\\nno apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age,\\nyet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at\\nwhich it first appeared in the parent. I believe this rule to be of the\\nhighest importance in explaining the laws of embryology. These remarks are\\nof course confined to the first _appearance_ of the peculiarity, and not to\\nits primary cause, which may have acted on the ovules or male element; in\\nnearly the same manner as in the crossed offspring from a short-horned cow\\nby a long-horned bull, the greater length of horn, though appearing late in\\nlife, is clearly due to the male element.\\n\\nHaving alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to a statement\\noften made by naturalists--namely, that our domestic varieties, when run\\nwild, gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal\\nstocks. Hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from\\ndomestic races to species in a state of nature. I have in vain endeavoured\\nto discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so\\nboldly been made. There would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we\\nmay safely conclude that very many of the most strongly-marked domestic\\nvarieties could not possibly live in a wild state. In many cases we do not\\nknow what the aboriginal stock was, and so could not tell whether or not\\nnearly perfect reversion had ensued. It would be quite necessary, in order\\nto prevent the effects of intercrossing, that only a single variety should\\nbe turned loose in its new home. Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly\\ndo occasionally {15} revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms,\\nit seems to me not improbable, that if we could succeed in naturalising, or\\nwere to cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for\\ninstance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil (in which case, however, some\\neffect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil),\\nthat they would to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild\\naboriginal stock. Whether or not the experiment would succeed, is not of\\ngreat importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment itself the\\nconditions of life are changed. If it could be shown that our domestic\\nvarieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion,--that is, to lose\\ntheir acquired characters, whilst kept under the same conditions, and\\nwhilst kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check,\\nby blending together, any slight deviations in their structure, in such\\ncase, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in\\nregard to species. But there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this\\nview: to assert that we could not breed our cart and race-horses, long and\\nshort-horned cattle, and poultry of various breeds, and esculent\\nvegetables, for an almost infinite number of generations, would be opposed\\nto all experience. I may add, that when under nature the conditions of life\\ndo change, variations and reversions of character probably do occur; but\\nnatural selection, as will hereafter be explained, will determine how far\\nthe new characters thus arising shall be preserved.\\n\\nWhen we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals\\nand plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we generally\\nperceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of\\ncharacter than in true species. Domestic races of the same species, also,\\noften have a somewhat monstrous character; by which I mean, that, although\\ndiffering {16} from each other, and from other species of the same genus,\\nin several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in\\nsome one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially\\nwhen compared with all the species in nature to which they are nearest\\nallied. With these exceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility of\\nvarieties when crossed,--a subject hereafter to be discussed), domestic\\nraces of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as,\\nonly in most cases in a lesser degree than, do closely-allied species of\\nthe same genus in a state of nature. I think this must be admitted, when we\\nfind that there are hardly any domestic races, either amongst animals or\\nplants, which have not been ranked by competent judges as mere varieties,\\nand by other competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct\\nspecies. If any marked distinction existed between domestic races and\\nspecies, this source of doubt could not so perpetually recur. It has often\\nbeen stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters\\nof generic value. I think it could be shown that this statement is hardly\\ncorrect; but naturalists differ widely in determining what characters are\\nof generic value; all such valuations being at present empirical. Moreover,\\non the view of the origin of genera which I shall presently give, we have\\nno right to expect often to meet with generic differences in our\\ndomesticated productions.\\n\\nWhen we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between the\\ndomestic races of the same species, we are soon involved in doubt, from not\\nknowing whether they have descended from one or several parent-species.\\nThis point, if it could be cleared up, would be interesting; if, for\\ninstance, it could be shown that the greyhound, bloodhound, terrier,\\nspaniel, and bull-dog, which we all know propagate their kind so truly,\\nwere the {17} offspring of any single species, then such facts would have\\ngreat weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very\\nclosely allied natural species--for instance, of the many foxes--inhabiting\\ndifferent quarters of the world. I do not believe, as we shall presently\\nsee, that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of the\\ndog has been produced under domestication; I believe that some small part\\nof the difference is due to their being descended from distinct species. In\\nthe case of some other domesticated species, there is presumptive, or even\\nstrong evidence, that all the breeds have descended from a single wild\\nstock.\\n\\nIt has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and\\nplants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and likewise to\\nwithstand diverse climates. I do not dispute that these capacities have\\nadded largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions; but how\\ncould a savage possibly know, when he first tamed an animal, whether it\\nwould vary in succeeding generations, and whether it would endure other\\nclimates? Has the little variability of the ass or guinea-fowl, or the\\nsmall power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer, or of cold by the\\ncommon camel, prevented their domestication? I cannot doubt that if other\\nanimals and plants, equal in number to our domesticated productions, and\\nbelonging to equally diverse classes and countries, were taken from a state\\nof nature, and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations\\nunder domestication, they would vary on an average as largely as the parent\\nspecies of our existing domesticated productions have varied.\\n\\nIn the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants, I do\\nnot think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether they\\nhave descended from one or several wild species. The argument mainly relied\\non by those who believe in the multiple origin {18} of our domestic animals\\nis, that we find in the most ancient records, more especially on the\\nmonuments of Egypt, much diversity in the breeds; and that some of the\\nbreeds closely resemble, perhaps are identical with, those still existing.\\nEven if this latter fact were found more strictly and generally true than\\nseems to me to be the case, what does it show, but that some of our breeds\\noriginated there, four or five thousand years ago? But Mr. Horner\\'s\\nresearches have rendered it in some degree probable that man sufficiently\\ncivilized to have manufactured pottery existed in the valley of the Nile\\nthirteen or fourteen thousand years ago; and who will pretend to say how\\nlong before these ancient periods, savages, like those of Tierra del Fuego\\nor Australia, who possess a semi-domestic dog, may not have existed in\\nEgypt?\\n\\nThe whole subject must, I think, remain vague; nevertheless, I may, without\\nhere entering on any details, state that, from geographical and other\\nconsiderations, I think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have\\ndescended from several wild species. Knowing, as we do, that savages are\\nvery fond of taming animals, it seems to me unlikely, in the case of the\\ndog-genus, which is distributed in a wild state throughout the world, that\\nsince man first appeared one single species alone should have been\\ndomesticated. In regard to sheep and goats I can form no opinion. I should\\nthink, from facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth, on the habits, voice,\\nand constitution, &c., of the humped Indian cattle, that these had\\ndescended from a different aboriginal stock from our European cattle; and\\nseveral competent judges believe that these latter have had more than one\\nwild parent. With respect to horses, from reasons which I cannot give here,\\nI am doubtfully inclined to believe, in opposition to several authors, that\\nall the races have descended from one {19} wild stock. Mr. Blyth, whose\\nopinion, from his large and varied stores of knowledge, I should value more\\nthan that of almost any one, thinks that all the breeds of poultry have\\nproceeded from the common wild Indian fowl (Gallus bankiva). In regard to\\nducks and rabbits, the breeds of which differ considerably from each other\\nin structure, I do not doubt that they have all descended from the common\\nwild duck and rabbit.\\n\\nThe doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several\\naboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors.\\nThey believe that every race which breeds true, let the distinctive\\ncharacters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype. At this rate\\nthere must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle, as many\\nsheep, and several goats in Europe alone, and several even within Great\\nBritain. One author believes that there formerly existed in Great Britain\\neleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it! When we bear in mind that\\nBritain has now hardly one peculiar mammal, and France but few distinct\\nfrom those of Germany and conversely, and so with Hungary, Spain, &c., but\\nthat each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle,\\nsheep, &c, we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in\\nEurope; for whence could they have been derived, as these several countries\\ndo not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parent-stocks? So\\nit is in India. Even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world,\\nwhich I fully admit have probably descended from several wild species, I\\ncannot doubt that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation.\\nWho can believe that animals closely resembling the Italian greyhound, the\\nbloodhound, the bull-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, &c.--so unlike all wild\\nCanidГ¦--ever existed freely in a state of nature? It has often been loosely\\nsaid that all our races of dogs have {20} been produced by the crossing of\\na few aboriginal species; but by crossing we can only get forms in some\\ndegree intermediate between their parents; and if we account for our\\nseveral domestic races by this process, we must admit the former existence\\nof the most extreme forms, as the Italian greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog,\\n&c., in the wild state. Moreover, the possibility of making distinct races\\nby crossing has been greatly exaggerated. There can be no doubt that a race\\nmay be modified by occasional crosses, if aided by the careful selection of\\nthose individual mongrels, which present any desired character; but that a\\nrace could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different\\nraces or species, I can hardly believe. Sir J. Sebright expressly\\nexperimentised for this object, and failed. The offspring from the first\\ncross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I have found\\nwith pigeons) extremely uniform, and everything seems simple enough; but\\nwhen these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations,\\nhardly two of them will be alike, and then the extreme difficulty, or\\nrather utter hopelessness, of the task becomes apparent. Certainly, a breed\\nintermediate between _two very distinct_ breeds could not be got without\\nextreme care and long-continued selection; nor can I find a single case on\\nrecord of a permanent race having been thus formed.\\n\\n_On the Breeds of the Domestic Pigeon._--Believing that it is always best\\nto study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken up domestic\\npigeons. I have kept every breed which I could purchase or obtain, and have\\nbeen most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world,\\nmore especially by the Hon. W. Elliot from India, and by the Hon. C. Murray\\nfrom Persia. Many treatises in different languages have been published on\\npigeons, and some of them are very important, as being of {21} considerable\\nantiquity. I have associated with several eminent fanciers, and have been\\npermitted to join two of the London Pigeon Clubs. The diversity of the\\nbreeds is something astonishing. Compare the English carrier and the\\nshort-faced tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks,\\nentailing corresponding differences in their skulls. The carrier, more\\nespecially the male bird, is also remarkable from the wonderful development\\nof the carunculated skin about the head, and this is accompanied by greatly\\nelongated eyelids, very large external orifices to the nostrils, and a wide\\ngape of mouth. The short-faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like\\nthat of a finch; and the common tumbler has the singular inherited habit of\\nflying at a great height in a compact flock, and tumbling in the air head\\nover heels. The runt is a bird of great size, with long, massive beak and\\nlarge feet; some of the sub-breeds of runts have very long necks, others\\nvery long wings and tails, others singularly short tails. The barb is\\nallied to the carrier, but, instead of a very long beak, has a very short\\nand very broad one. The pouter has a much elongated body, wings, and legs;\\nand its enormously developed crop, which it glories in inflating, may well\\nexcite astonishment and even laughter. The turbit has a very short and\\nconical beak, with a line of reversed feathers down the breast; and it has\\nthe habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the\\noesophagus. The Jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of\\nthe neck that they form a hood, and it has, proportionally to its size,\\nmuch elongated wing and tail feathers. The trumpeter and laugher, as their\\nnames express, utter a very different coo from the other breeds. The\\nfantail has thirty or even forty tail feathers, instead of twelve or\\nfourteen, the normal number in all members of the great pigeon family; and\\nthese feathers are kept expanded, and are {22} carried so erect that in\\ngood birds the head and tail touch; the oil-gland is quite aborted. Several\\nother less distinct breeds might be specified.\\n\\nIn the skeletons of the several breeds, the development of the bones of the\\nface in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously. The shape, as\\nwell as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw, varies in a\\nhighly remarkable manner. The number of the caudal and sacral vertebrГ¦\\nvary; as does the number of the ribs, together with their relative breadth\\nand the presence of processes. The size and shape of the apertures in the\\nsternum are highly variable; so is the degree of divergence and relative\\nsize of the two arms of the furcula. The proportional width of the gape of\\nmouth, the proportional length of the eyelids, of the orifice of the\\nnostrils, of the tongue (not always in strict correlation with the length\\nof beak), the size of the crop and of the upper part of the oesophagus; the\\ndevelopment and abortion of the oil-gland; the number of the primary wing\\nand caudal feathers; the relative length of wing and tail to each other and\\nto the body; the relative length of leg and of the feet; the number of\\nscutellГ¦ on the toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all\\npoints of structure which are variable. The period at which the perfect\\nplumage is acquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the\\nnestling birds are clothed when hatched. The shape and size of the eggs\\nvary. The manner of flight differs remarkably; as does in some breeds the\\nvoice and disposition. Lastly, in certain breeds, the males and females\\nhave come to differ to a slight degree from each other.\\n\\nAltogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown to\\nan ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would\\ncertainly, I think, be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover, I\\ndo not believe that any ornithologist would place the {23} English carrier,\\nthe short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail in the\\nsame genus; more especially as in each of these breeds several\\ntruly-inherited sub-breeds, or species as he might have called them, could\\nbe shown him.\\n\\nGreat as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons, I am fully\\nconvinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that\\nall have descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia), including under\\nthis term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each\\nother in the most trifling respects. As several of the reasons which have\\nled me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases, I will\\nhere briefly give them. If the several breeds are not varieties, and have\\nnot proceeded from the rock-pigeon, they must have descended from at least\\nseven or eight aboriginal stocks; for it is impossible to make the present\\ndomestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number: how, for instance,\\ncould a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the\\nparent-stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop? The supposed\\naboriginal stocks must all have been rock-pigeons, that is, not breeding or\\nwillingly perching on trees. But besides C. livia, with its geographical\\nsub-species, only two or three other species of rock-pigeons are known; and\\nthese have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds. Hence the\\nsupposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where\\nthey were originally domesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists;\\nand this, considering their size, habits, and remarkable characters, seems\\nvery improbable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state. But\\nbirds breeding on precipices, and good fliers, are unlikely to be\\nexterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with\\nthe domestic breeds, has not been exterminated {24} even on several of the\\nsmaller British islets, or on the shores of the Mediterranean. Hence the\\nsupposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the\\nrock-pigeon seems to me a very rash assumption. Moreover, the several\\nabove-named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the\\nworld, and, therefore, some of them must have been carried back again into\\ntheir native country; but not one has ever become wild or feral, though the\\ndovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very slightly altered state,\\nhas become feral in several places. Again, all recent experience shows that\\nit is most difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under\\ndomestication; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons,\\nit must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly\\ndomesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite\\nprolific under confinement.\\n\\nAn argument, as it seems to me, of great weight, and applicable in several\\nother cases, is, that the above-specified breeds, though agreeing generally\\nin constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most parts of their\\nstructure, with the wild rock-pigeon, yet are certainly highly abnormal in\\nother parts of their structure; we may look in vain throughout the whole\\ngreat family of ColumbidГ¦ for a beak like that of the English carrier, or\\nthat of the short-faced tumbler, or barb; for reversed feathers like those\\nof the Jacobin; for a crop like that of the pouter; for tail-feathers like\\nthose of the fantail. Hence it must be assumed not only that half-civilized\\nman succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he\\nintentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and\\nfurther, that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown.\\nSo many strange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree.\\n{25}\\n\\nSome facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve\\nconsideration. The rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, and has a white rump\\n(the Indian subspecies, C. intermedia of Strickland, having it bluish); the\\ntail has a terminal dark bar, with the bases of the outer feathers\\nexternally edged with white; the wings have two black bars; some\\nsemi-domestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have, besides\\nthe two black bars, the wings chequered with black. These several marks do\\nnot occur together in any other species of the whole family. Now, in every\\none of the domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all the\\nabove marks, even to the white edging of the outer tail-feathers, sometimes\\nconcur perfectly developed. Moreover, when two birds belonging to two\\ndistinct breeds are crossed, neither of which is blue or has any of the\\nabove-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to\\nacquire these characters; for instance, I crossed some uniformly white\\nfantails with some uniformly black barbs, and they produced mottled brown\\nand black birds; these I again crossed together, and one grandchild of the\\npure white fantail and pure black barb was of as beautiful a blue colour,\\nwith the white rump, double black wing-bar, and barred and white-edged\\ntail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! We can understand these facts, on\\nthe well-known principle of reversion to ancestral characters, if all the\\ndomestic breeds have descended from the rock-pigeon. But if we deny this,\\nwe must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions.\\nEither, firstly, that all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were\\ncoloured and marked like the rock-pigeon, although no other existing\\nspecies is thus coloured and marked, so that in each separate breed there\\nmight be a tendency to revert to the very same colours and markings. Or,\\nsecondly, {26} that each breed, even the purest, has within a dozen or, at\\nmost, within a score of generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon: I say\\nwithin a dozen or twenty generations, for we know of no fact countenancing\\nthe belief that the child ever reverts to some one ancestor, removed by a\\ngreater number of generations. In a breed which has been crossed only once\\nwith some distinct breed, the tendency to reversion to any character\\nderived from such cross will naturally become less and less, as in each\\nsucceeding generation there will be less of the foreign blood; but when\\nthere has been no cross with a distinct breed, and there is a tendency in\\nboth parents to revert to a character, which has been lost during some\\nformer generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to the contrary,\\nmay be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations.\\nThese two distinct cases are often confounded in treatises on inheritance.\\n\\nLastly, the hybrids or mongrels from between all the domestic breeds of\\npigeons are perfectly fertile. I can state this from my own observations,\\npurposely made, on the most distinct breeds. Now, it is difficult, perhaps\\nimpossible, to bring forward one case of the hybrid offspring of two\\nanimals _clearly distinct_ being themselves perfectly fertile. Some authors\\nbelieve that long-continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency\\nto sterility: from the history of the dog I think there is some probability\\nin this hypothesis, if applied to species closely related together, though\\nit is unsupported by a single experiment. But to extend the hypothesis so\\nfar as to suppose that species, aboriginally as distinct as carriers,\\ntumblers, pouters, and fantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly\\nfertile, _inter se_, seems to me rash in the extreme.\\n\\nFrom these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having\\nformerly got seven or eight supposed {27} species of pigeons to breed\\nfreely under domestication; these supposed species being quite unknown in a\\nwild state, and their becoming nowhere feral; these species having very\\nabnormal characters in certain respects, as compared with all other\\nColumbidГ¦, though so like in most other respects to the rock-pigeon; the\\nblue colour and various marks occasionally appearing in all the breeds,\\nboth when kept pure and when crossed; the mongrel offspring being perfectly\\nfertile;--from these several reasons, taken together, I can feel no doubt\\nthat all our domestic breeds have descended from the Columba livia with its\\ngeographical sub-species.\\n\\nIn favour of this view, I may add, firstly, that C. livia, or the\\nrock-pigeon, has been found capable of domestication in Europe and in\\nIndia; and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of\\nstructure with all the domestic breeds. Secondly, although an English\\ncarrier or short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from\\nthe rock-pigeon, yet by comparing the several sub-breeds of these\\nvarieties, more especially those brought from distant countries, we can\\nmake an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure. Thirdly,\\nthose characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed, for instance\\nthe wattle and length of beak of the carrier, the shortness of that of the\\ntumbler, and the number of tail-feathers in the fantail, are in each breed\\neminently variable; and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when\\nwe come to treat of selection. Fourthly, pigeons have been watched, and\\ntended with the utmost care, and loved by many people. They have been\\ndomesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the world; the\\nearliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth Г†gyptian dynasty, about\\n3000 B.C., as was pointed out to me by Professor Lepsius; but Mr. Birch\\ninforms me that pigeons are given in a bill {28} of fare in the previous\\ndynasty. In the time of the Romans, as we hear from Pliny, immense prices\\nwere given for pigeons; \"nay, they are come to this pass, that they can\\nreckon up their pedigree and race.\" Pigeons were much valued by Akber Khan\\nin India, about the year 1600; never less than 20,000 pigeons were taken\\nwith the court. \"The monarchs of Iran and Turan sent him some very rare\\nbirds;\" and, continues the courtly historian, \"His Majesty by crossing the\\nbreeds, which method was never practised before, has improved them\\nastonishingly.\" About this same period the Dutch were as eager about\\npigeons as were the old Romans. The paramount importance of these\\nconsiderations in explaining the immense amount of variation which pigeons\\nhave undergone, will be obvious when we treat of Selection. We shall then,\\nalso, see how it is that the breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous\\ncharacter. It is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of\\ndistinct breeds, that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life;\\nand thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary.\\n\\nI have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some, yet quite\\ninsufficient, length; because when I first kept pigeons and watched the\\nseveral kinds, knowing well how true they bred, I felt fully as much\\ndifficulty in believing that they could have descended from a common\\nparent, as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard\\nto the many species of finches, or other large groups of birds, in nature.\\nOne circumstance has struck me much; namely, that all the breeders of the\\nvarious domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with whom I have\\never conversed, or whose treatises I have read, are firmly convinced that\\nthe several breeds to which each has attended, are descended from so many\\naboriginally distinct species. {29} Ask, as I have asked, a celebrated\\nraiser of Hereford cattle, whether his cattle might not have descended from\\nlong-horns, and he will laugh you to scorn. I have never met a pigeon, or\\npoultry, or duck, or rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each\\nmain breed was descended from a distinct species. Van Mons, in his treatise\\non pears and apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several\\nsorts, for instance a Ribston-pippin or Codlin-apple, could ever have\\nproceeded from the seeds of the same tree. Innumerable other examples could\\nbe given. The explanation, I think, is simple: from long-continued study\\nthey are strongly impressed with the differences between the several races;\\nand though they well know that each race varies slightly, for they win\\ntheir prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they ignore all\\ngeneral arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences\\naccumulated during many successive generations. May not those naturalists\\nwho, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder, and\\nknowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of\\ndescent, yet admit that many of our domestic races have descended from the\\nsame parents--may they not learn a lesson of caution, when they deride the\\nidea of species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other\\nspecies?\\n\\n_Selection._--Let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races\\nhave been produced, either from one or from several allied species. Some\\nlittle effect may, perhaps, be attributed to the direct action of the\\nexternal conditions of life, and some little to habit; but he would be a\\nbold man who would account by such agencies for the differences of a dray\\nand race horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon.\\nOne of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races {30} is that\\nwe see in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal\\'s or plant\\'s own good,\\nbut to man\\'s use or fancy. Some variations useful to him have probably\\narisen suddenly, or by one step; many botanists, for instance, believe that\\nthe fuller\\'s teazle, with its hooks, which cannot be rivalled by any\\nmechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild Dipsacus; and this\\namount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling. So it has probably\\nbeen with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been the case with\\nthe ancon sheep. But when we compare the dray-horse and race-horse, the\\ndromedary and camel, the various breeds of sheep fitted either for\\ncultivated land or mountain pasture, with the wool of one breed good for\\none purpose, and that of another breed for another purpose; when we compare\\nthe many breeds of dogs, each good for man in very different ways; when we\\ncompare the game-cock, so pertinacious in battle, with other breeds so\\nlittle quarrelsome, with \"everlasting layers\" which never desire to sit,\\nand with the bantam so small and elegant; when we compare the host of\\nagricultural, culinary, orchard, and flower-garden races of plants, most\\nuseful to man at different seasons and for different purposes, or so\\nbeautiful in his eyes, we must, I think, look further than to mere\\nvariability. We cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced\\nas perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in several cases, we\\nknow that this has not been their history. The key is man\\'s power of\\naccumulative selection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them\\nup in certain directions useful to him. In this sense he may be said to\\nmake for himself useful breeds.\\n\\nThe great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical. It is\\ncertain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a single\\nlifetime, modified to {31} a large extent some breeds of cattle and sheep.\\nIn order fully to realise what they have done, it is almost necessary to\\nread several of the many treatises devoted to this subject, and to inspect\\nthe animals. Breeders habitually speak of an animal\\'s organisation as\\nsomething quite plastic, which they can model almost as they please. If I\\nhad space I could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly\\ncompetent authorities. Youatt, who was probably better acquainted with the\\nworks of agriculturists than almost any other individual, and who was\\nhimself a very good judge of an animal, speaks of the principle of\\nselection as \"that which enables the agriculturist, not only to modify the\\ncharacter of his flock, but to change it altogether. It is the magician\\'s\\nwand, by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he\\npleases.\" Lord Somerville, speaking of what breeders have done for sheep,\\nsays:--\"It would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect\\nin itself, and then had given it existence.\" That most skilful breeder, Sir\\nJohn Sebright, used to say, with respect to pigeons, that \"he would produce\\nany given feather in three years, but it would take him six years to obtain\\nhead and beak.\" In Saxony the importance of the principle of selection in\\nregard to merino sheep is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a\\ntrade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture by a\\nconnoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and the sheep\\nare each time marked and classed, so that the very best may ultimately be\\nselected for breeding.\\n\\nWhat English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous\\nprices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have now been\\nexported to almost every quarter of the world. The improvement is by no\\nmeans generally due to crossing different breeds; {32} all the best\\nbreeders are strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes amongst\\nclosely allied sub-breeds. And when a cross has been made, the closest\\nselection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. If\\nselection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety, and\\nbreeding from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth\\nnotice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the\\naccumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of\\ndifferences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye--differences\\nwhich I for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. Not one man in a\\nthousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent\\nbreeder. If gifted with these qualities, and he studies his subject for\\nyears, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance, he\\nwill succeed, and may make great improvements; if he wants any of these\\nqualities, he will assuredly fail. Few would readily believe in the natural\\ncapacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful\\npigeon-fancier.\\n\\nThe same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations are\\nhere often more abrupt. No one supposes that our choicest productions have\\nbeen produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock. We have\\nproofs that this is not so in some cases, in which exact records have been\\nkept; thus, to give a very trifling instance, the steadily-increasing size\\nof the common gooseberry may be quoted. We see an astonishing improvement\\nin many florists\\' flowers, when the flowers of the present day are compared\\nwith drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago. When a race of plants\\nis once pretty well established, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best\\nplants, but merely go over their seed-beds, and pull up the \"rogues,\" as\\nthey call the plants that deviate from the proper standard. With animals\\nthis {33} kind of selection is, in fact, also followed; for hardly any one\\nis so careless as to allow his worst animals to breed.\\n\\nIn regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated\\neffects of selection--namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in the\\ndifferent varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the diversity\\nof leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the\\nkitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties; and\\nthe diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in comparison\\nwith the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties. See how different\\nthe leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the flowers; how\\nunlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the leaves; how\\nmuch the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size,\\ncolour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very slight\\ndifferences. It is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one\\npoint do not differ at all in other points; this is hardly ever, perhaps\\nnever, the case. The laws of correlation of growth, the importance of which\\nshould never be overlooked, will ensure some differences; but, as a general\\nrule, I cannot doubt that the continued selection of slight variations,\\neither in the leaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races\\ndiffering from each other chiefly in these characters.\\n\\nIt may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to\\nmethodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century; it\\nhas certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises have\\nbeen published on the subject; and the result has been, in a corresponding\\ndegree, rapid and important. But it is very far from true that the\\nprinciple is a modern discovery. I could give several references to the\\nfull acknowledgment of the importance of the principle in works of high\\nantiquity. In rude and barbarous periods {34} of English history choice\\nanimals were often imported, and laws were passed to prevent their\\nexportation: the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered,\\nand this may be compared to the \"roguing\" of plants by nurserymen. The\\nprinciple of selection I find distinctly given in an ancient Chinese\\nencyclopГ¦dia. Explicit rules are laid down by some of the Roman classical\\nwriters. From passages in Genesis, it is clear that the colour of domestic\\nanimals was at that early period attended to. Savages now sometimes cross\\ntheir dogs with wild canine animals, to improve the breed, and they\\nformerly did so, as is attested by passages in Pliny. The savages in South\\nAfrica match their draught cattle by colour, as do some of the Esquimaux\\ntheir teams of dogs. Livingstone shows how much good domestic breeds are\\nvalued by the negroes of the interior of Africa who have not associated\\nwith Europeans. Some of these facts do not show actual selection, but they\\nshow that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in\\nancient times, and is now attended to by the lowest savages. It would,\\nindeed, have been a strange fact, had attention not been paid to breeding,\\nfor the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious.\\n\\nAt the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with a\\ndistinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior to\\nanything existing in the country. But, for our purpose, a kind of\\nSelection, which may be called Unconscious, and which results from every\\none trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is more\\nimportant. Thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get\\nas good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs, but\\nhe has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed.\\nNevertheless I cannot doubt that this process, continued during centuries,\\n{35} would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as Bakewell,\\nCollins, &c., by this very same process, only carried on more methodically,\\ndid greatly modify, even during their own lifetimes, the forms and\\nqualities of their cattle. Slow and insensible changes of this kind could\\nnever be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the\\nbreeds in question had been made long ago, which might serve for\\ncomparison. In some cases, however, unchanged, or but little changed\\nindividuals of the same breed may be found in less civilised districts,\\nwhere the breed has been less improved. There is reason to believe that\\nKing Charles\\'s spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent\\nsince the time of that monarch. Some highly competent authorities are\\nconvinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel, and has\\nprobably been slowly altered from it. It is known that the English pointer\\nhas been greatly changed within the last century, and in this case the\\nchange has, it is believed, been chiefly effected by crosses with the\\nfox-hound; but what concerns us is, that the change has been effected\\nunconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually, that, though the old\\nSpanish pointer certainly came from Spain, Mr. Borrow has not seen, as I am\\ninformed by him, any native dog in Spain like our pointer.\\n\\nBy a similar process of selection, and by careful training, the whole body\\nof English racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent\\nArab stock, so that the latter, by the regulations for the Goodwood Races,\\nare favoured in the weights they carry. Lord Spencer and others have shown\\nhow the cattle of England have increased in weight and in early maturity,\\ncompared with the stock formerly kept in this country. By comparing the\\naccounts given in old pigeon treatises of carriers and tumblers with these\\nbreeds as now existing in Britain, {36} India, and Persia, we can, I think,\\nclearly trace the stages through which they have insensibly passed, and\\ncome to differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon.\\n\\nYouatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of\\nselection, which may be considered as unconsciously followed, in so far\\nthat the breeders could never have expected or even have wished to have\\nproduced the result which ensued--namely, the production of two distinct\\nstrains. The two flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr.\\nBurgess, as Mr. Youatt remarks, \"have been purely bred from the original\\nstock of Mr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty years. There is not a suspicion\\nexisting in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the\\nowner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure\\nblood of Mr. Bakewell\\'s flock, and yet the difference between the sheep\\npossessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance\\nof being quite different varieties.\"\\n\\nIf there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited\\ncharacter of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal\\nparticularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully\\npreserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are so\\nliable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring\\nthan the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a kind of\\nunconscious selection going on. We see the value set on animals even by the\\nbarbarians of Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and devouring their old\\nwomen, in times of dearth, as of less value than their dogs.\\n\\nIn plants the same gradual process of improvement, through the occasional\\npreservation of the best individuals, whether or not sufficiently distinct\\nto be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties, and whether\\n{37} or not two or more species or races have become blended together by\\ncrossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which\\nwe now see in the varieties of the heartsease, rose, pelargonium, dahlia,\\nand other plants, when compared with the older varieties or with their\\nparent-stocks. No one would ever expect to get a first-rate heartsease or\\ndahlia from the seed of a wild plant. No one would expect to raise a\\nfirst-rate melting pear from the seed of the wild pear, though he might\\nsucceed from a poor seedling growing wild, if it had come from a\\ngarden-stock. The pear, though cultivated in classical times, appears, from\\nPliny\\'s description, to have been a fruit of very inferior quality. I have\\nseen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the wonderful skill\\nof gardeners, in having produced such splendid results from such poor\\nmaterials; but the art, I cannot doubt, has been simple, and, as far as the\\nfinal result is concerned, has been followed almost unconsciously. It has\\nconsisted in always cultivating the best known variety, sowing its seeds,\\nand, when a slightly better variety has chanced to appear, selecting it,\\nand so onwards. But the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated\\nthe best pear they could procure, never thought what splendid fruit we\\nshould eat; though we owe our excellent fruit, in some small degree, to\\ntheir having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could\\nanywhere find.\\n\\nA large amount of change in our cultivated plants, thus slowly and\\nunconsciously accumulated, explains, as I believe, the well-known fact,\\nthat in a vast number of cases we cannot recognise, and therefore do not\\nknow, the wild parent-stocks of the plants which have been longest\\ncultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens. If it has taken centuries or\\nthousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their\\npresent {38} standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is\\nthat neither Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, nor any other region\\ninhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth\\nculture. It is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a\\nstrange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that\\nthe native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a\\nstandard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in\\ncountries anciently civilised.\\n\\nIn regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should not be\\noverlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food, at\\nleast during certain seasons. And in two countries very differently\\ncircumstanced, individuals of the same species, having slightly different\\nconstitutions or structure, would often succeed better in the one country\\nthan in the other; and thus by a process of \"natural selection,\" as will\\nhereafter be more fully explained, two sub-breeds might be formed. This,\\nperhaps, partly explains what has been remarked by some authors, namely,\\nthat the varieties kept by savages have more of the character of species\\nthan the varieties kept in civilised countries.\\n\\nOn the view here given of the all-important part which selection by man has\\nplayed, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic races show\\nadaptation in their structure or in their habits to man\\'s wants or fancies.\\nWe can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal character of\\nour domestic races, and likewise their differences being so great in\\nexternal characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs.\\nMan can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation of\\nstructure excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he rarely\\ncares for what is internal. He can never act by selection, excepting on\\nvariations {39} which are first given to him in some slight degree by\\nnature. No man would ever try to make a fantail, till he saw a pigeon with\\na tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter\\ntill he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size; and the more\\nabnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared, the more\\nlikely it would be to catch his attention. But to use such an expression as\\ntrying to make a fantail, is, I have no doubt, in most cases, utterly\\nincorrect. The man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail,\\nnever dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon would become through\\nlong-continued, partly unconscious and partly methodical selection. Perhaps\\nthe parent bird of all fantails had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat\\nexpanded, like the present Java fantail, or like individuals of other and\\ndistinct breeds, in which as many as seventeen tail-feathers have been\\ncounted. Perhaps the first pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more\\nthan the turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus,--a habit which\\nis disregarded by all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the\\nbreed.\\n\\nNor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be\\nnecessary to catch the fancier\\'s eye: he perceives extremely small\\ndifferences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however\\nslight, in one\\'s own possession. Nor must the value which would formerly be\\nset on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species, be\\njudged of by the value which would now be set on them, after several breeds\\nhave once fairly been established. Many slight differences might, and\\nindeed do now, arise amongst pigeons, which are rejected as faults or\\ndeviations from the standard of perfection of each breed. The common goose\\nhas not given rise to any marked varieties; hence the Thoulouse and the\\ncommon breed, which differ only in colour, that {40} most fleeting of\\ncharacters, have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry-shows.\\n\\nI think these views further explain what has sometimes been\\nnoticed--namely, that we know nothing about the origin or history of any of\\nour domestic breeds. But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language,\\ncan hardly be said to have had a definite origin. A man preserves and\\nbreeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes\\nmore care than usual in matching his best animals and thus improves them,\\nand the improved individuals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood.\\nBut as yet they will hardly have a distinct name, and from being only\\nslightly valued, their history will be disregarded. When further improved\\nby the same slow and gradual process, they will spread more widely, and\\nwill get recognised as something distinct and valuable, and will then\\nprobably first receive a provincial name. In semi-civilised countries, with\\nlittle free communication, the spreading and knowledge of any new sub-breed\\nwill be a slow process. As soon as the points of value of the new sub-breed\\nare once fully acknowledged, the principle, as I have called it, of\\nunconscious selection will always tend,--perhaps more at one period than at\\nanother, as the breed rises or falls in fashion,--perhaps more in one\\ndistrict than in another, according to the state of civilization of the\\ninhabitants,--slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed,\\nwhatever they may be. But the chance will be infinitely small of any record\\nhaving been preserved of such slow, varying, and insensible changes.\\n\\nI must now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable, or the\\nreverse, to man\\'s power of selection. A high degree of variability is\\nobviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to work\\non; not that mere individual differences are not amply {41} sufficient,\\nwith extreme care, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of\\nmodification in almost any desired direction. But as variations manifestly\\nuseful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the chance of their\\nappearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being\\nkept; and hence this comes to be of the highest importance to success. On\\nthis principle Marshall has remarked, with respect to the sheep of parts of\\nYorkshire, that \"as they generally belong to poor people, and are mostly\\n_in small lots_, they never can be improved.\" On the other hand,\\nnurserymen, from raising large stocks of the same plants, are generally far\\nmore successful than amateurs in getting new and valuable varieties. The\\nkeeping of a large number of individuals of a species in any country\\nrequires that the species should be placed under favourable conditions of\\nlife, so as to breed freely in that country. When the individuals of any\\nspecies are scanty, all the individuals, whatever their quality may be,\\nwill generally be allowed to breed, and this will effectually prevent\\nselection. But probably the most important point of all, is, that the\\nanimal or plant should be so highly useful to man, or so much valued by\\nhim, that the closest attention should be paid to even the slightest\\ndeviation in the qualities or structure of each individual. Unless such\\nattention be paid nothing can be effected. I have seen it gravely remarked,\\nthat it was most fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when\\ngardeners began to attend closely to this plant. No doubt the strawberry\\nhad always varied since it was cultivated, but the slight varieties had\\nbeen neglected. As soon, however, as gardeners picked out individual plants\\nwith slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and raised seedlings from\\nthem, and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them, then,\\nthere appeared (aided by some {42} crossing with distinct species) those\\nmany admirable varieties of the strawberry which have been raised during\\nthe last thirty or forty years.\\n\\nIn the case of animals with separate sexes, facility in preventing crosses\\nis an important element of success in the formation of new races,--at\\nleast, in a country which is already stocked with other races. In this\\nrespect enclosure of the land plays a part. Wandering savages or the\\ninhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same\\nspecies. Pigeons can be mated for life, and this is a great convenience to\\nthe fancier, for thus many races may be kept true, though mingled in the\\nsame aviary; and this circumstance must have largely favoured the\\nimprovement and formation of new breeds. Pigeons, I may add, can be\\npropagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate, and inferior birds\\nmay be freely rejected, as when killed they serve for food. On the other\\nhand, cats, from their nocturnal rambling habits, cannot be matched, and,\\nalthough so much valued by women and children, we hardly ever see a\\ndistinct breed kept up; such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost\\nalways imported from some other country, often from islands. Although I do\\nnot doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others, yet the rarity\\nor absence of distinct breeds of the cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, &c.,\\nmay be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into\\nplay: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a\\nfew being kept by poor people, and little attention paid to their breeding;\\nin peacocks, from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept;\\nin geese, from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and\\nmore especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of\\ndistinct breeds.\\n\\nTo sum up on the origin of our Domestic Races of {43} animals and plants. I\\nbelieve that the conditions of life, from their action on the reproductive\\nsystem, are so far of the highest importance as causing variability. I do\\nnot believe that variability is an inherent and necessary contingency,\\nunder all circumstances, with all organic beings, as some authors have\\nthought. The effects of variability are modified by various degrees of\\ninheritance and of reversion. Variability is governed by many unknown laws,\\nmore especially by that of correlation of growth. Something may be\\nattributed to the direct action of the conditions of life. Something must\\nbe attributed to use and disuse. The final result is thus rendered\\ninfinitely complex. In some cases, I do not doubt that the intercrossing of\\nspecies, aboriginally distinct, has played an important part in the origin\\nof our domestic productions. When in any country several domestic breeds\\nhave once been established, their occasional intercrossing, with the aid of\\nselection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation of new sub-breeds;\\nbut the importance of the crossing of varieties has, I believe, been\\ngreatly exaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which\\nare propagated by seed. In plants which are temporarily propagated by\\ncuttings, buds, &c., the importance of the crossing both of distinct\\nspecies and of varieties is immense; for the cultivator here quite\\ndisregards the extreme variability both of hybrids and mongrels, and the\\nfrequent sterility of hybrids; but the cases of plants not propagated by\\nseed are of little importance to us, for their endurance is only temporary.\\nOver all these causes of Change I am convinced that the accumulative action\\nof Selection, whether applied methodically and more quickly, or\\nunconsciously and more slowly, but more efficiently, is by far the\\npredominant Power.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{44}\\n\\nCHAPTER II.\\n\\nVARIATION UNDER NATURE.\\n\\n    Variability--Individual differences--Doubtful species--Wide ranging,\\n    much diffused, and common species vary most--Species of the larger\\n    genera in any country vary more than the species of the smaller\\n    genera--Many of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in\\n    being very closely, but unequally, related to each other, and in having\\n    restricted ranges.\\n\\nBefore applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic\\nbeings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss whether these latter\\nare subject to any variation. To treat this subject at all properly, a long\\ncatalogue of dry facts should be given; but these I shall reserve for my\\nfuture work. Nor shall I here discuss the various definitions which have\\nbeen given of the term species. No one definition has as yet satisfied all\\nnaturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he\\nspeaks of a species. Generally the term includes the unknown element of a\\ndistinct act of creation. The term \"variety\" is almost equally difficult to\\ndefine; but here community of descent is almost universally implied, though\\nit can rarely be proved. We have also what are called monstrosities; but\\nthey graduate into varieties. By a monstrosity I presume is meant some\\nconsiderable deviation of structure in one part, either injurious to or not\\nuseful to the species, and not generally propagated. Some authors use the\\nterm \"variation\" in a technical sense, as implying a modification directly\\ndue to the physical conditions of life; and \"variations\" in this sense are\\nsupposed not to be inherited: but who can say that the dwarfed condition of\\nshells in the brackish waters of the Baltic, or dwarfed {45} plants on\\nAlpine summits, or the thicker fur of an animal from far northwards, would\\nnot in some cases be inherited for at least some few generations? and in\\nthis case I presume that the form would be called a variety.\\n\\nAgain, we have many slight differences which may be called individual\\ndifferences, such as are known frequently to appear in the offspring from\\nthe same parents, or which may be presumed to have thus arisen, from being\\nfrequently observed in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the\\nsame confined locality. No one supposes that all the individuals of the\\nsame species are cast in the very same mould. These individual differences\\nare highly important for us, as they afford materials for natural selection\\nto accumulate, in the same manner as man can accumulate in any given\\ndirection individual differences in his domesticated productions. These\\nindividual differences generally affect what naturalists consider\\nunimportant parts; but I could show by a long catalogue of facts, that\\nparts which must be called important, whether viewed under a physiological\\nor classificatory point of view, sometimes vary in the individuals of the\\nsame species. I am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be\\nsurprised at the number of the cases of variability, even in important\\nparts of structure, which he could collect on good authority, as I have\\ncollected, during a course of years. It should be remembered that\\nsystematists are far from pleased at finding variability in important\\ncharacters, and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine\\ninternal and important organs, and compare them in many specimens of the\\nsame species. I should never have expected that the branching of the main\\nnerves close to the great central ganglion of an insect would have been\\nvariable in the same species; I should have expected that changes of this\\nnature could have been effected only {46} by slow degrees: yet quite\\nrecently Mr. Lubbock has shown a degree of variability in these main nerves\\nin Coccus, which may almost be compared to the irregular branching of the\\nstem of a tree. This philosophical naturalist, I may add, has also quite\\nrecently shown that the muscles in the larvГ¦ of certain insects are very\\nfar from uniform. Authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that\\nimportant organs never vary; for these same authors practically rank that\\ncharacter as important (as some few naturalists have honestly confessed)\\nwhich does not vary; and, under this point of view, no instance of an\\nimportant part varying will ever be found: but under any other point of\\nview many instances assuredly can be given.\\n\\nThere is one point connected with individual differences, which seems to me\\nextremely perplexing: I refer to those genera which have sometimes been\\ncalled \"protean\" or \"polymorphic,\" in which the species present an\\ninordinate amount of variation; and hardly two naturalists can agree which\\nforms to rank as species and which as varieties. We may instance Rubus,\\nRosa, and Hieracium amongst plants, several genera of insects, and several\\ngenera of Brachiopod shells. In most polymorphic genera some of the species\\nhave fixed and definite characters. Genera which are polymorphic in one\\ncountry seem to be, with some few exceptions, polymorphic in other\\ncountries, and likewise, judging from Brachiopod shells, at former periods\\nof time. These facts seem to be very perplexing, for they seem to show that\\nthis kind of variability is independent of the conditions of life. I am\\ninclined to suspect that we see in these polymorphic genera variations in\\npoints of structure which are of no service or disservice to the species,\\nand which consequently have not been seized on and rendered definite by\\nnatural selection, as hereafter will be explained. {47}\\n\\nThose forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of\\nspecies, but which are so closely similar to some other forms, or are so\\nclosely linked to them by intermediate gradations, that naturalists do not\\nlike to rank them as distinct species, are in several respects the most\\nimportant for us. We have every reason to believe that many of these\\ndoubtful and closely-allied forms have permanently retained their\\ncharacters in their own country for a long time; for as long, as far as we\\nknow, as have good and true species. Practically, when a naturalist can\\nunite two forms together by others having intermediate characters, he\\ntreats the one as a variety of the other, ranking the most common, but\\nsometimes the one first described, as the species, and the other as the\\nvariety. But cases of great difficulty, which I will not here enumerate,\\nsometimes occur in deciding whether or not to rank one form as a variety of\\nanother, even when they are closely connected by intermediate links; nor\\nwill the commonly-assumed hybrid nature of the intermediate links always\\nremove the difficulty. In very many cases, however, one form is ranked as a\\nvariety of another, not because the intermediate links have actually been\\nfound, but because analogy leads the observer to suppose either that they\\ndo now somewhere exist, or may formerly have existed; and here a wide door\\nfor the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened.\\n\\nHence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or a\\nvariety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide\\nexperience seems the only guide to follow. We must, however, in many cases,\\ndecide by a majority of naturalists, for few well-marked and well-known\\nvarieties can be named which have not been ranked as species by at least\\nsome competent judges. {48}\\n\\nThat varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be\\ndisputed. Compare the several floras of Great Britain, of France or of the\\nUnited States, drawn up by different botanists, and see what a surprising\\nnumber of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good species, and by\\nanother as mere varieties. Mr. H. C. Watson, to whom I lie under deep\\nobligation for assistance of all kinds, has marked for me 182 British\\nplants, which are generally considered as varieties, but which have all\\nbeen ranked by botanists as species; and in making this list he has omitted\\nmany trifling varieties, but which nevertheless have been ranked by some\\nbotanists as species, and he has entirely omitted several highly\\npolymorphic genera. Under genera, including the most polymorphic forms, Mr.\\nBabington gives 251 species, whereas Mr. Bentham gives only 112,--a\\ndifference of 139 doubtful forms! Amongst animals which unite for each\\nbirth, and which are highly locomotive, doubtful forms, ranked by one\\nzoologist as a species and by another as a variety, can rarely be found\\nwithin the same country, but are common in separated areas. How many of\\nthose birds and insects in North America and Europe, which differ very\\nslightly from each other, have been ranked by one eminent naturalist as\\nundoubted species, and by another as varieties, or, as they are often\\ncalled, as geographical races! Many years ago, when comparing, and seeing\\nothers compare, the birds from the separate islands of the Galapagos\\nArchipelago, both one with another, and with those from the American\\nmainland, I was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the\\ndistinction between species and varieties. On the islets of the little\\nMadeira group there are many insects which are characterized as varieties\\nin Mr. Wollaston\\'s admirable work, but which it cannot {49} be doubted\\nwould be ranked as distinct species by many entomologists. Even Ireland has\\na few animals, now generally regarded as varieties, but which have been\\nranked as species by some zoologists. Several most experienced\\nornithologists consider our British red grouse as only a strongly-marked\\nrace of a Norwegian species, whereas the greater number rank it as an\\nundoubted species peculiar to Great Britain. A wide distance between the\\nhomes of two doubtful forms leads many naturalists to rank both as distinct\\nspecies; but what distance, it has been well asked, will suffice? if that\\nbetween America and Europe is ample, will that between the Continent and\\nthe Azores, or Madeira, or the Canaries, or Ireland, be sufficient? It must\\nbe admitted that many forms, considered by highly-competent judges as\\nvarieties, have so perfectly the character of species that they are ranked\\nby other highly-competent judges as good and true species. But to discuss\\nwhether they are rightly called species or varieties, before any definition\\nof these terms has been generally accepted, is vainly to beat the air.\\n\\nMany of the cases of strongly-marked varieties or doubtful species well\\ndeserve consideration; for several interesting lines of argument, from\\ngeographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism, &c., have been\\nbrought to bear on the attempt to determine their rank. I will here give\\nonly a single instance,--the well-known one of the primrose and cowslip, or\\nPrimula vulgaris and veris. These plants differ considerably in appearance;\\nthey have a different flavour, and emit a different odour; they flower at\\nslightly different periods; they grow in somewhat different stations; they\\nascend mountains to different heights; they have different geographical\\nranges; and lastly, according to very numerous experiments made during\\nseveral years by {50} that most careful observer GГ¤rtner, they can be\\ncrossed only with much difficulty. We could hardly wish for better evidence\\nof the two forms being specifically distinct. On the other hand, they are\\nunited by many intermediate links, and it is very doubtful whether these\\nlinks are hybrids; and there is, as it seems to me, an overwhelming amount\\nof experimental evidence, showing that they descend from common parents,\\nand consequently must be ranked as varieties.\\n\\nClose investigation, in most cases, will bring naturalists to an agreement\\nhow to rank doubtful forms. Yet it must be confessed that it is in the\\nbest-known countries that we find the greatest number of forms of doubtful\\nvalue. I have been struck with the fact, that if any animal or plant in a\\nstate of nature be highly useful to man, or from any cause closely attract\\nhis attention, varieties of it will almost universally be found recorded.\\nThese varieties, moreover, will be often ranked by some authors as species.\\nLook at the common oak, how closely it has been studied; yet a German\\nauthor makes more than a dozen species out of forms, which are very\\ngenerally considered as varieties; and in this country the highest\\nbotanical authorities and practical men can be quoted to show that the\\nsessile and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct species or mere\\nvarieties.\\n\\nWhen a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms quite\\nunknown to him, he is at first much perplexed to determine what differences\\nto consider as specific, and what as varieties; for he knows nothing of the\\namount and kind of variation to which the group is subject; and this shows,\\nat least, how very generally there is some variation. But if he confine his\\nattention to one class within one country, he will soon make up his mind\\nhow to rank most of the doubtful forms. His {51} general tendency will be\\nto make many species, for he will become impressed, just like the pigeon or\\npoultry fancier before alluded to, with the amount of difference in the\\nforms which he is continually studying; and he has little general knowledge\\nof analogical variation in other groups and in other countries, by which to\\ncorrect his first impressions. As he extends the range of his observations,\\nhe will meet with more cases of difficulty; for he will encounter a greater\\nnumber of closely-allied forms. But if his observations be widely extended,\\nhe will in the end generally be enabled to make up his own mind which to\\ncall varieties and which species; but he will succeed in this at the\\nexpense of admitting much variation,--and the truth of this admission will\\noften be disputed by other naturalists. When, moreover, he comes to study\\nallied forms brought from countries not now continuous, in which case he\\ncan hardly hope to find the intermediate links between his doubtful forms,\\nhe will have to trust almost entirely to analogy, and his difficulties rise\\nto a climax.\\n\\nCertainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between\\nspecies and sub-species--that is, the forms which in the opinion of some\\nnaturalists come very near to, but do not quite arrive at the rank of\\nspecies; or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties, or\\nbetween lesser varieties and individual differences. These differences\\nblend into each other in an insensible series; and a series impresses the\\nmind with the idea of an actual passage.\\n\\nHence I look at individual differences, though of small interest to the\\nsystematist, as of high importance for us, as being the first step towards\\nsuch slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in works on\\nnatural history. And I look at varieties which are in any degree more\\ndistinct and permanent, as steps leading to more {52} strongly marked and\\nmore permanent varieties; and at these latter, as leading to sub-species,\\nand to species. The passage from one stage of difference to another and\\nhigher stage may be, in some cases, due merely to the long-continued action\\nof different physical conditions in two different regions; but I have not\\nmuch faith in this view; and I attribute the passage of a variety, from a\\nstate in which it differs very slightly from its parent to one in which it\\ndiffers more, to the action of natural selection in accumulating (as will\\nhereafter be more fully explained) differences of structure in certain\\ndefinite directions. Hence I believe a well-marked variety may be called an\\nincipient species; but whether this belief be justifiable must be judged of\\nby the general weight of the several facts and views given throughout this\\nwork.\\n\\nIt need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species necessarily\\nattain the rank of species. They may whilst in this incipient state become\\nextinct, or they may endure as varieties for very long periods, as has been\\nshown to be the case by Mr. Wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil\\nland-shells in Madeira. If a variety were to flourish so as to exceed in\\nnumbers the parent species, it would then rank as the species, and the\\nspecies as the variety; or it might come to supplant and exterminate the\\nparent species; or both might co-exist, and both rank as independent\\nspecies. But we shall hereafter have to return to this subject.\\n\\nFrom these remarks it will be seen that I look at the term species, as one\\narbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals\\nclosely resembling each other, and that it does not essentially differ from\\nthe term variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating\\nforms. The term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual\\ndifferences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for mere convenience\\' sake.\\n{53}\\n\\nGuided by theoretical considerations, I thought that some interesting\\nresults might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the\\nspecies which vary most, by tabulating all the varieties in several\\nwell-worked floras. At first this seemed a simple task; but Mr. H. C.\\nWatson, to whom I am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance on\\nthis subject, soon convinced me that there were many difficulties, as did\\nsubsequently Dr. Hooker, even in stronger terms. I shall reserve for my\\nfuture work the discussion of these difficulties, and the tables themselves\\nof the proportional numbers of the varying species. Dr. Hooker permits me\\nto add, that after having carefully read my manuscript, and examined the\\ntables, he thinks that the following statements are fairly well\\nestablished. The whole subject, however, treated as it necessarily here is\\nwith much brevity, is rather perplexing, and allusions cannot be avoided to\\nthe \"struggle for existence,\" \"divergence of character,\" and other\\nquestions, hereafter to be discussed.\\n\\nAlph. de Candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wide\\nranges generally present varieties; and this might have been expected, as\\nthey become exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as they come into\\ncompetition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is a far more important\\ncircumstance) with different sets of organic beings. But my tables further\\nshow that, in any limited country, the species which are most common, that\\nis abound most in individuals, and the species which are most widely\\ndiffused within their own country (and this is a different consideration\\nfrom wide range, and to a certain extent from commonness), often give rise\\nto varieties sufficiently well-marked to have been recorded in botanical\\nworks. Hence it is the most flourishing, or, as they may be called, the\\ndominant species,--those {54} which range widely over the world, are the\\nmost diffused in their own country, and are the most numerous in\\nindividuals,--which oftenest produce well-marked varieties, or, as I\\nconsider them, incipient species. And this, perhaps, might have been\\nanticipated; for, as varieties, in order to become in any degree permanent,\\nnecessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of the country, the\\nspecies which are already dominant will be the most likely to yield\\noffspring, which, though in some slight degree modified, still inherit\\nthose advantages that enabled their parents to become dominant over their\\ncompatriots.\\n\\nIf the plants inhabiting a country and described in any Flora be divided\\ninto two equal masses, all those in the larger genera being placed on one\\nside, and all those in the smaller genera on the other side, a somewhat\\nlarger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant species will\\nbe found on the side of the larger genera. This, again, might have been\\nanticipated; for the mere fact of many species of the same genus inhabiting\\nany country, shows that there is something in the organic or inorganic\\nconditions of that country favourable to the genus; and, consequently, we\\nmight have expected to have found in the larger genera, or those including\\nmany species, a large proportional number of dominant species. But so many\\ncauses tend to obscure this result, that I am surprised that my tables show\\neven a small majority on the side of the larger genera. I will here allude\\nto only two causes of obscurity. Fresh-water and salt-loving plants have\\ngenerally very wide ranges and are much diffused, but this seems to be\\nconnected with the nature of the stations inhabited by them, and has little\\nor no relation to the size of the genera to which the species belong.\\nAgain, plants low in the scale of organisation are {55} generally much more\\nwidely diffused than plants higher in the scale; and here again there is no\\nclose relation to the size of the genera. The cause of lowly-organised\\nplants ranging widely will be discussed in our chapter on geographical\\ndistribution.\\n\\nFrom looking at species as only strongly-marked and well-defined varieties,\\nI was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera in each\\ncountry would oftener present varieties, than the species of the smaller\\ngenera; for wherever many closely related species (_i.e._ species of the\\nsame genus) have been formed, many varieties or incipient species ought, as\\na general rule, to be now forming. Where many large trees grow, we expect\\nto find saplings. Where many species of a genus have been formed through\\nvariation, circumstances have been favourable for variation; and hence we\\nmight expect that the circumstances would generally be still favourable to\\nvariation. On the other hand, if we look at each species as a special act\\nof creation, there is no apparent reason why more varieties should occur in\\na group having many species, than in one having few.\\n\\nTo test the truth of this anticipation I have arranged the plants of twelve\\ncountries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts, into two nearly\\nequal masses, the species of the larger genera on one side, and those of\\nthe smaller genera on the other side, and it has invariably proved to be\\nthe case that a larger proportion of the species on the side of the larger\\ngenera present varieties, than on the side of the smaller genera. Moreover,\\nthe species of the large genera which present any varieties, invariably\\npresent a larger average number of varieties than do the species of the\\nsmall genera. Both these results follow when another division is made, and\\nwhen all the smallest genera, with from only one to four species, are\\nabsolutely excluded from the tables. These {56} facts are of plain\\nsignification on the view that species are only strongly marked and\\npermanent varieties; for wherever many species of the same genus have been\\nformed, or where, if we may use the expression, the manufactory of species\\nhas been active, we ought generally to find the manufactory still in\\naction, more especially as we have every reason to believe the process of\\nmanufacturing new species to be a slow one. And this certainly is the case,\\nif varieties be looked at as incipient species; for my tables clearly show\\nas a general rule that, wherever many species of a genus have been formed,\\nthe species of that genus present a number of varieties, that is of\\nincipient species beyond the average. It is not that all large genera are\\nnow varying much, and are thus increasing in the number of their species,\\nor that no small genera are now varying and increasing; for if this had\\nbeen so, it would have been fatal to my theory; inasmuch as geology plainly\\ntells us that small genera have in the lapse of time often increased\\ngreatly in size; and that large genera have often come to their maxima,\\ndeclined, and disappeared. All that we want to show is, that where many\\nspecies of a genus have been formed, on an average many are still forming;\\nand this holds good.\\n\\nThere are other relations between the species of large genera and their\\nrecorded varieties which deserve notice. We have seen that there is no\\ninfallible criterion by which to distinguish species and well-marked\\nvarieties; and in those cases in which intermediate links have not been\\nfound between doubtful forms, naturalists are compelled to come to a\\ndetermination by the amount of difference between them, judging by analogy\\nwhether or not the amount suffices to raise one or both to the rank of\\nspecies. Hence the amount of difference is one very important criterion in\\nsettling whether two forms {57} should be ranked as species or varieties.\\nNow Fries has remarked in regard to plants, and Westwood in regard to\\ninsects, that in large genera the amount of difference between the species\\nis often exceedingly small. I have endeavoured to test this numerically by\\naverages, and, as far as my imperfect results go, they confirm the view. I\\nhave also consulted some sagacious and experienced observers, and, after\\ndeliberation, they concur in this view. In this respect, therefore, the\\nspecies of the larger genera resemble varieties, more than do the species\\nof the smaller genera. Or the case may be put in another way, and it may be\\nsaid, that in the larger genera, in which a number of varieties or\\nincipient species greater than the average are now manufacturing, many of\\nthe species already manufactured still to a certain extent resemble\\nvarieties, for they differ from each other by a less than usual amount of\\ndifference.\\n\\nMoreover, the species of the large genera are related to each other, in the\\nsame manner as the varieties of any one species are related to each other.\\nNo naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are equally distinct\\nfrom each other; they may generally be divided into sub-genera, or\\nsections, or lesser groups. As Fries has well remarked, little groups of\\nspecies are generally clustered like satellites around certain other\\nspecies. And what are varieties but groups of forms, unequally related to\\neach other, and clustered round certain forms--that is, round their\\nparent-species? Undoubtedly there is one most important point of difference\\nbetween varieties and species; namely, that the amount of difference\\nbetween varieties, when compared with each other or with their\\nparent-species, is much less than that between the species of the same\\ngenus. But when we come to discuss the principle, as I call it, of\\nDivergence of Character, {58} we shall see how this may be explained, and\\nhow the lesser differences between varieties will tend to increase into the\\ngreater differences between species.\\n\\nThere is one other point which seems to me worth notice. Varieties\\ngenerally have much restricted ranges: this statement is indeed scarcely\\nmore than a truism, for if a variety were found to have a wider range than\\nthat of its supposed parent-species, their denominations ought to be\\nreversed. But there is also reason to believe, that those species which are\\nvery closely allied to other species, and in so far resemble varieties,\\noften have much restricted ranges. For instance, Mr. H. C. Watson has\\nmarked for me in the well-sifted London Catalogue of plants (4th edition)\\n63 plants which are therein ranked as species, but which he considers as so\\nclosely allied to other species as to be of doubtful value: these 63\\nreputed species range on an average over 6.9 of the provinces into which\\nMr. Watson has divided Great Britain. Now, in this same catalogue, 53\\nacknowledged varieties are recorded, and these range over 7.7 provinces;\\nwhereas, the species to which these varieties belong range over 14.3\\nprovinces. So that the acknowledged varieties have very nearly the same\\nrestricted average range, as have those very closely allied forms, marked\\nfor me by Mr. Watson as doubtful species, but which are almost universally\\nranked by British botanists as good and true species.\\n\\n\\n\\nFinally, then, varieties have the same general characters as species, for\\nthey cannot be distinguished from species,--except, firstly, by the\\ndiscovery of intermediate linking forms, and the occurrence of such links\\ncannot affect the actual characters of the forms which they connect; and\\nexcept, secondly by a certain amount of {59} difference, for two forms, if\\ndiffering very little, are generally ranked as varieties, notwithstanding\\nthat intermediate linking forms have not been discovered; but the amount of\\ndifference considered necessary to give to two forms the rank of species is\\nquite indefinite. In genera having more than the average number of species\\nin any country, the species of these genera have more than the average\\nnumber of varieties. In large genera the species are apt to be closely, but\\nunequally allied together, forming little clusters round certain species.\\nSpecies very closely allied to other species apparently have restricted\\nranges. In all these several respects the species of large genera present a\\nstrong analogy with varieties. And we can clearly understand these\\nanalogies, if species have once existed as varieties, and have thus\\noriginated: whereas, these analogies are utterly inexplicable if each\\nspecies has been independently created.\\n\\nWe have, also, seen that it is the most flourishing or dominant species of\\nthe larger genera which on an average vary most; and varieties, as we shall\\nhereafter see, tend to become converted into new and distinct species. The\\nlarger genera thus tend to become larger; and throughout nature the forms\\nof life which are now dominant tend to become still more dominant by\\nleaving many modified and dominant descendants. But by steps hereafter to\\nbe explained, the larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera.\\nAnd thus, the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into\\ngroups subordinate to groups.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{60}\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nSTRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.\\n\\n    Bears on natural selection--The term used in a wide sense--Geometrical\\n    powers of increase--Rapid increase of naturalised animals and\\n    plants--Nature of the checks to increase--Competition\\n    universal--Effects of climate--Protection from the number of\\n    individuals--Complex relations of all animals and plants throughout\\n    nature--Struggle for life most severe between individuals and varieties\\n    of the same species; often severe between species of the same\\n    genus--The relation of organism to organism the most important of all\\n    relations.\\n\\nBefore entering on the subject of this chapter, I must make a few\\npreliminary remarks, to show how the struggle for existence bears on\\nNatural Selection. It has been seen in the last chapter that amongst\\norganic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variability:\\nindeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed. It is immaterial\\nfor us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called species or\\nsub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or three hundred\\ndoubtful forms of British plants are entitled to hold, if the existence of\\nany well-marked varieties be admitted. But the mere existence of individual\\nvariability and of some few well-marked varieties, though necessary as the\\nfoundation for the work, helps us but little in understanding how species\\narise in nature. How have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of\\nthe organisation to another part, and to the conditions of life, and of one\\ndistinct organic being to another being, been perfected? We see these\\nbeautiful co-adaptations most {61} plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe;\\nand only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the\\nhairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle\\nwhich dives through the water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the\\ngentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in\\nevery part of the organic world.\\n\\nAgain, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called\\nincipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct\\nspecies, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more than\\ndo the varieties of the same species? How do those groups of species, which\\nconstitute what are called distinct genera, and which differ from each\\nother more than do the species of the same genus, arise? All these results,\\nas we shall more fully see in the next chapter, follow from the struggle\\nfor life. Owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight,\\nand from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an\\nindividual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other\\norganic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of\\nthat individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring. The\\noffspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the\\nmany individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small\\nnumber can survive. I have called this principle, by which each slight\\nvariation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of Natural Selection, in\\norder to mark its relation to man\\'s power of selection. We have seen that\\nman by selection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt organic\\nbeings to his own uses, through the accumulation of slight but useful\\nvariations, given to him by the hand of Nature. But Natural Selection, as\\nwe shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as\\n{62} immeasurably superior to man\\'s feeble efforts, as the works of Nature\\nare to those of Art.\\n\\nWe will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence. In\\nmy future work this subject shall be treated, as it well deserves, at much\\ngreater length. The elder de Candolle and Lyell have largely and\\nphilosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe\\ncompetition. In regard to plants, no one has treated this subject with more\\nspirit and ability than W. Herbert, Dean of Manchester, evidently the\\nresult of his great horticultural knowledge. Nothing is easier than to\\nadmit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or more\\ndifficult--at least I have found it so--than constantly to bear this\\nconclusion in mind. Yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind, I am\\nconvinced that the whole economy of nature, with every fact on\\ndistribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly\\nseen or quite misunderstood. We behold the face of nature bright with\\ngladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or we forget\\nthat the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or\\nseeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely\\nthese songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds\\nand beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that though food may be\\nnow superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year.\\n\\nI should premise that I use the term Struggle for Existence in a large and\\nmetaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another, and\\nincluding (which is more important) not only the life of the individual,\\nbut success in leaving progeny. Two canine animals in a time of dearth, may\\nbe truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live.\\nBut a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle {63} for life\\nagainst the drought, though more properly it should be said to be dependent\\non the moisture. A plant which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which\\non an average only one comes to maturity, may be more truly said to\\nstruggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe\\nthe ground. The missletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees,\\nbut can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle with these trees,\\nfor if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree, it will languish\\nand die. But several seedling missletoes, growing close together on the\\nsame branch, may more truly be said to struggle with each other. As the\\nmissletoe is disseminated by birds, its existence depends on birds; and it\\nmay metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in\\norder to tempt birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than\\nthose of other plants. In these several senses, which pass into each other,\\nI use for convenience\\' sake the general term of struggle for existence.\\n\\nA struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which all\\norganic beings tend to increase. Every being, which during its natural\\nlifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction during\\nsome period of its life, and during some season or occasional year,\\notherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers would\\nquickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the\\nproduct. Hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive,\\nthere must in every case be a struggle for existence, either one individual\\nwith another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct\\nspecies, or with the physical conditions of life. It is the doctrine of\\nMalthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable\\nkingdoms; for in this case there {64} can be no artificial increase of\\nfood, and no prudential restraint from marriage. Although some species may\\nbe now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for\\nthe world would not hold them.\\n\\nThere is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally\\nincreases at so high a rate, that if not destroyed, the earth would soon be\\ncovered by the progeny of a single pair. Even slow-breeding man has doubled\\nin twenty-five years, and at this rate, in a few thousand years, there\\nwould literally not be standing room for his progeny. LinnГ¦us has\\ncalculated that if an annual plant produced only two seeds--and there is no\\nplant so unproductive as this--and their seedlings next year produced two,\\nand so on, then in twenty years there would be a million plants. The\\nelephant is reckoned the slowest breeder of all known animals, and I have\\ntaken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase:\\nit will be under the mark to assume that it breeds when thirty years old,\\nand goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing forth three pair of\\nyoung in this interval; if this be so, at the end of the fifth century\\nthere would be alive fifteen million elephants, descended from the first\\npair.\\n\\nBut we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical\\ncalculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly\\nrapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when circumstances\\nhave been favourable to them during two or three following seasons. Still\\nmore striking is the evidence from our domestic animals of many kinds which\\nhave run wild in several parts of the world: if the statements of the rate\\nof increase of slow-breeding cattle and horses in South America, and\\nlatterly in Australia, had not been well authenticated, they would have\\nbeen incredible. So it is with plants: cases could be given of {65}\\nintroduced plants which have become common throughout whole islands in a\\nperiod of less than ten years. Several of the plants, such as the cardoon\\nand a tall thistle, now most numerous over the wide plains of La Plata,\\nclothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of all other\\nplants, have been introduced from Europe; and there are plants which now\\nrange in India, as I hear from Dr. Falconer, from Cape Comorin to the\\nHimalaya, which have been imported from America since its discovery. In\\nsuch cases, and endless instances could be given, no one supposes that the\\nfertility of these animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily\\nincreased in any sensible degree. The obvious explanation is that the\\nconditions of life have been very favourable, and that there has\\nconsequently been less destruction of the old and young, and that nearly\\nall the young have been enabled to breed. In such cases the geometrical\\nratio of increase, the result of which never fails to be surprising, simply\\nexplains the extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion of\\nnaturalised productions in their new homes.\\n\\nIn a state of nature almost every plant produces seed, and amongst animals\\nthere are very few which do not annually pair. Hence we may confidently\\nassert, that all plants and animals are tending to increase at a\\ngeometrical ratio, that all would most rapidly stock every station in which\\nthey could any how exist, and that the geometrical tendency to increase\\nmust be checked by destruction at some period of life. Our familiarity with\\nthe larger domestic animals tends, I think, to mislead us: we see no great\\ndestruction falling on them, and we forget that thousands are annually\\nslaughtered for food, and that in a state of nature an equal number would\\nhave somehow to be disposed of.\\n\\nThe only difference between organisms which annually {66} produce eggs or\\nseeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely few, is, that the\\nslow-breeders would require a few more years to people, under favourable\\nconditions, a whole district, let it be ever so large. The condor lays a\\ncouple of eggs and the ostrich a score, and yet in the same country the\\ncondor may be the more numerous of the two: the Fulmar petrel lays but one\\negg, yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird in the world. One fly\\ndeposits hundreds of eggs, and another, like the hippobosca, a single one;\\nbut this difference does not determine how many individuals of the two\\nspecies can be supported in a district. A large number of eggs is of some\\nimportance to those species which depend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of\\nfood, for it allows them rapidly to increase in number. But the real\\nimportance of a large number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much\\ndestruction at some period of life; and this period in the great majority\\nof cases is an early one. If an animal can in any way protect its own eggs\\nor young, a small number may be produced, and yet the average stock be\\nfully kept up; but if many eggs or young are destroyed, many must be\\nproduced, or the species will become extinct. It would suffice to keep up\\nthe full number of a tree, which lived on an average for a thousand years,\\nif a single seed were produced once in a thousand years, supposing that\\nthis seed were never destroyed, and could be ensured to germinate in a\\nfitting place. So that in all cases, the average number of any animal or\\nplant depends only indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds.\\n\\nIn looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing\\nconsiderations always in mind--never to forget that every single organic\\nbeing around us may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in\\nnumbers; that each lives by a struggle at some period of {67} its life;\\nthat heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old, during\\neach generation or at recurrent intervals. Lighten any check, mitigate the\\ndestruction ever so little, and the number of the species will almost\\ninstantaneously increase to any amount.\\n\\nThe causes which check the natural tendency of each species to increase in\\nnumber are most obscure. Look at the most vigorous species; by as much as\\nit swarms in numbers, by so much will its tendency to increase be still\\nfurther increased. We know not exactly what the checks are in even one\\nsingle instance. Nor will this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant\\nwe are on this head, even in regard to mankind, so incomparably better\\nknown than any other animal. This subject has been ably treated by several\\nauthors, and I shall, in my future work, discuss some of the checks at\\nconsiderable length, more especially in regard to the feral animals of\\nSouth America. Here I will make only a few remarks, just to recall to the\\nreader\\'s mind some of the chief points. Eggs or very young animals seem\\ngenerally to suffer most, but this is not invariably the case. With plants\\nthere is a vast destruction of seeds, but, from some observations which I\\nhave made, I believe that it is the seedlings which suffer most from\\ngerminating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants. Seedlings,\\nalso, are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies; for instance, on a\\npiece of ground three feet long and two wide, dug and cleared, and where\\nthere could be no choking from other plants, I marked all the seedlings of\\nour native weeds as they came up, and out of the 357 no less than 295 were\\ndestroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects. If turf which has long been mown,\\nand the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds, be\\nlet to grow, the more vigorous plants {68} gradually kill the less\\nvigorous, though fully grown, plants: thus out of twenty species growing on\\na little plot of turf (three feet by four) nine species perished from the\\nother species being allowed to grow up freely.\\n\\nThe amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme limit to\\nwhich each can increase; but very frequently it is not the obtaining food,\\nbut the serving as prey to other animals, which determines the average\\nnumbers of a species. Thus, there seems to be little doubt that the stock\\nof partridges, grouse, and hares on any large estate depends chiefly on the\\ndestruction of vermin. If not one head of game were shot during the next\\ntwenty years in England, and, at the same time, if no vermin were\\ndestroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game than at present,\\nalthough hundreds of thousands of game animals are now annually killed. On\\nthe other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant and rhinoceros, none\\nare destroyed by beasts of prey: even the tiger in India most rarely dares\\nto attack a young elephant protected by its dam.\\n\\nClimate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a\\nspecies, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought, I believe to be\\nthe most effective of all checks. I estimated that the winter of 1854-55\\ndestroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this is a\\ntremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent, is an\\nextraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man. The action of\\nclimate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for\\nexistence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it\\nbrings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of the\\nsame or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food. Even\\nwhen climate, for instance extreme cold, {69} acts directly, it will be the\\nleast vigorous, or those which have got least food through the advancing\\nwinter, which will suffer most. When we travel from south to north, or from\\na damp region to a dry, we invariably see some species gradually getting\\nrarer and rarer, and finally disappearing; and the change of climate being\\nconspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct\\naction. But this is a false view: we forget that each species, even where\\nit most abounds, is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some\\nperiod of its life, from enemies or from competitors for the same place and\\nfood; and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured\\nby any slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers, and, as\\neach area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species will\\ndecrease. When we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers,\\nwe may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being\\nfavoured, as in this one being hurt. So it is when we travel northward, but\\nin a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of species of all kinds, and\\ntherefore of competitors, decreases northwards; hence in going northward,\\nor in ascending a mountain, we far oftener meet with stunted forms, due to\\nthe _directly_ injurious action of climate, than we do in proceeding\\nsouthwards or in descending a mountain. When we reach the Arctic regions,\\nor snow-capped summits, or absolute deserts, the struggle for life is\\nalmost exclusively with the elements.\\n\\nThat climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species, we\\nmay clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our gardens which can\\nperfectly well endure our climate, but which never become naturalised, for\\nthey cannot compete with our native plants nor resist destruction by our\\nnative animals. {70}\\n\\nWhen a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases\\ninordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics--at least, this seems\\ngenerally to occur with our game animals--often ensue: and here we have a\\nlimiting check independent of the struggle for life. But even some of these\\nso-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms, which have from\\nsome cause, possibly in part through facility of diffusion amongst the\\ncrowded animals, been disproportionably favoured: and here comes in a sort\\nof struggle between the parasite and its prey.\\n\\nOn the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of the same\\nspecies, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is absolutely necessary\\nfor its preservation. Thus we can easily raise plenty of corn and\\nrape-seed, &c., in our fields, because the seeds are in great excess\\ncompared with the number of birds which feed on them; nor can the birds,\\nthough having a superabundance of food at this one season, increase in\\nnumber proportionally to the supply of seed, as their numbers are checked\\nduring winter: but any one who has tried, knows how troublesome it is to\\nget seed from a few wheat or other such plants in a garden: I have in this\\ncase lost every single seed. This view of the necessity of a large stock of\\nthe same species for its preservation, explains, I believe, some singular\\nfacts in nature, such as that of very rare plants being sometimes extremely\\nabundant in the few spots where they do occur; and that of some social\\nplants being social, that is, abounding in individuals, even on the extreme\\nconfines of their range. For in such cases, we may believe, that a plant\\ncould exist only where the conditions of its life were so favourable that\\nmany could exist together, and thus save the species from utter\\ndestruction. I should add that the good effects of frequent intercrossing,\\nand {71} the ill effects of close interbreeding, probably come into play in\\nsome of these cases; but on this intricate subject I will not here enlarge.\\n\\nMany cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the checks\\nand relations between organic beings, which have to struggle together in\\nthe same country. I will give only a single instance, which, though a\\nsimple one, has interested me. In Staffordshire, on the estate of a\\nrelation, where I had ample means of investigation, there was a large and\\nextremely barren heath, which had never been touched by the hand of man;\\nbut several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been enclosed\\ntwenty-five years previously and planted with Scotch fir. The change in the\\nnative vegetation of the planted part of the heath was most remarkable,\\nmore than is generally seen in passing from one quite different soil to\\nanother: not only the proportional numbers of the heath-plants were wholly\\nchanged, but twelve species of plants (not counting grasses and carices)\\nflourished in the plantations, which could not be found on the heath. The\\neffect on the insects must have been still greater, for six insectivorous\\nbirds were very common in the plantations, which were not to be seen on the\\nheath; and the heath was frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous\\nbirds. Here we see how potent has been the effect of the introduction of a\\nsingle tree, nothing whatever else having been done, with the exception\\nthat the land had been enclosed, so that cattle could not enter. But how\\nimportant an element enclosure is, I plainly saw near Farnham, in Surrey.\\nHere there are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old Scotch firs on\\nthe distant hill-tops: within the last ten years large spaces have been\\nenclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so close\\ntogether that all cannot live. {72} When I ascertained that these young\\ntrees had not been sown or planted, I was so much surprised at their\\nnumbers that I went to several points of view, whence I could examine\\nhundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and literally I could not see a\\nsingle Scotch fir, except the old planted clumps. But on looking closely\\nbetween the stems of the heath, I found a multitude of seedlings and little\\ntrees, which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. In one square\\nyard, at a point some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps, I\\ncounted thirty-two little trees; and one of them, with twenty-six rings of\\ngrowth, had during many years tried to raise its head above the stems of\\nthe heath, and had failed. No wonder that, as soon as the land was\\nenclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs. Yet\\nthe heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever\\nhave imagined that cattle would have so closely and effectually searched it\\nfor food.\\n\\nHere we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the Scotch\\nfir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence of\\ncattle. Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance of this; for here\\nneither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though they swarm\\nsouthward and northward in a feral state; and Azara and Rengger have shown\\nthat this is caused by the greater number in Paraguay of a certain fly,\\nwhich lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born. The\\nincrease of these flies, numerous as they are, must be habitually checked\\nby some means, probably by birds. Hence, if certain insectivorous birds\\n(whose numbers are probably regulated by hawks or beasts of prey) were to\\nincrease in Paraguay, the flies would decrease--then cattle and horses\\nwould became feral, and this would certainly greatly {73} alter (as indeed\\nI have observed in parts of South America) the vegetation: this again would\\nlargely affect the insects; and this, as we just have seen in\\nStaffordshire, the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in ever-increasing\\ncircles of complexity. We began this series by insectivorous birds, and we\\nhave ended with them, Not that in nature the relations can ever be as\\nsimple as this. Battle within battle must ever be recurring with varying\\nsuccess; and yet in the long-run the forces are so nicely balanced, that\\nthe face of nature remains uniform for long periods of time, though\\nassuredly the merest trifle would often give the victory to one organic\\nbeing over another. Nevertheless so profound is our ignorance, and so high\\nour presumption, that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an\\norganic being; and as we do not see the cause, we invoke cataclysms to\\ndesolate the world, or invent laws on the duration of the forms of life!\\n\\nI am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals, most\\nremote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web of complex\\nrelations. I shall hereafter have occasion to show that the exotic Lobelia\\nfulgens, in this part of England, is never visited by insects, and\\nconsequently, from its peculiar structure, never can set a seed. Many of\\nour orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove\\ntheir pollen-masses and thus to fertilise them. I have, also, reason to\\nbelieve that humble-bees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the\\nheartsease (Viola tricolor), for other bees do not visit this flower. From\\nexperiments which I have lately tried, I have found that the visits of bees\\nare necessary for the fertilisation of some kinds of clover; but\\nhumble-bees alone visit the red clover (Trifolium pratense), as other bees\\ncannot reach the nectar. Hence I have very little doubt, that if the {74}\\nwhole genus of humble-bees became extinct or very rare in England, the\\nheartsease and red clover would become very rare, or wholly disappear. The\\nnumber of humble-bees in any district depends in a great degree on the\\nnumber of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and Mr. H.\\nNewman, who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes that\\n\"more than two-thirds of them are thus destroyed all over England.\" Now the\\nnumber of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on the number of\\ncats; and Mr. Newman says, \"Near villages and small towns I have found the\\nnests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I attribute to the\\nnumber of cats that destroy the mice.\" Hence it is quite credible that the\\npresence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine,\\nthrough the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of\\ncertain flowers in that district!\\n\\nIn the case of every species, many different checks, acting at different\\nperiods of life, and during different seasons or years, probably come into\\nplay; some one check or some few being generally the most potent, but all\\nconcur in determining the average number or even the existence of the\\nspecies. In some cases it can be shown that widely-different checks act on\\nthe same species in different districts. When we look at the plants and\\nbushes clothing an entangled bank, we are tempted to attribute their\\nproportional numbers and kinds to what we call chance. But how false a view\\nis this! Every one has heard that when an American forest is cut down, a\\nvery different vegetation springs up; but it has been observed that ancient\\nIndian ruins in the Southern United States, which must formerly have been\\ncleared of trees, now display the same beautiful diversity and proportion\\nof kinds as in the surrounding {75} virgin forests. What a struggle between\\nthe several kinds of trees must here have gone on during long centuries,\\neach annually scattering its seeds by the thousand; what war between insect\\nand insect--between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and\\nbeasts of prey--all striving to increase, and all feeding on each other or\\non the trees or their seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which\\nfirst clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees! Throw up\\na handful of feathers, and all must fall to the ground according to\\ndefinite laws; but how simple is this problem compared to the action and\\nreaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined, in\\nthe course of centuries, the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now\\ngrowing on the old Indian ruins!\\n\\nThe dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite on its\\nprey, lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature. This is\\noften the case with those which may strictly be said to struggle with each\\nother for existence, as in the case of locusts and grass-feeding\\nquadrupeds. But the struggle almost invariably will be most severe between\\nthe individuals of the same species, for they frequent the same districts,\\nrequire the same food, and are exposed to the same dangers. In the case of\\nvarieties of the same species, the struggle will generally be almost\\nequally severe, and we sometimes see the contest soon decided; for\\ninstance, if several varieties of wheat be sown together, and the mixed\\nseed be resown, some of the varieties which best suit the soil or climate,\\nor are naturally the most fertile, will beat the others and so yield more\\nseed, and will consequently in a few years quite supplant the other\\nvarieties. To keep up a mixed stock of even such extremely close varieties\\nas the variously {76} coloured sweet-peas, they must be each year harvested\\nseparately, and the seed then mixed in due proportion, otherwise the weaker\\nkinds will steadily decrease in numbers and disappear. So again with the\\nvarieties of sheep: it has been asserted that certain mountain-varieties\\nwill starve out other mountain-varieties, so that they cannot be kept\\ntogether. The same result has followed from keeping together different\\nvarieties of the medicinal leech. It may even be doubted whether the\\nvarieties of any one of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the\\nsame strength, habits, and constitution, that the original proportions of a\\nmixed stock could be kept up for half-a-dozen generations, if they were\\nallowed to struggle together, like beings in a state of nature, and if the\\nseed or young were not annually sorted.\\n\\nAs species of the same genus have usually, though by no means invariably,\\nsome similarity in habits and constitution, and always in structure, the\\nstruggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus,\\nwhen they come into competition with each other, than between species of\\ndistinct genera. We see this in the recent extension over parts of the\\nUnited States of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of\\nanother species. The recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of\\nScotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush. How frequently we hear\\nof one species of rat taking the place of another species under the most\\ndifferent climates! In Russia the small Asiatic cockroach has everywhere\\ndriven before it its great congener. One species of charlock will supplant\\nanother, and so in other cases. We can dimly see why the competition should\\nbe most severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the same place in\\nthe economy of nature; {77} but probably in no one case could we precisely\\nsay why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle of\\nlife.\\n\\nA corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing\\nremarks, namely, that the structure of every organic being is related, in\\nthe most essential yet often hidden manner, to that of all other organic\\nbeings, with which it comes into competition for food or residence, or from\\nwhich it has to escape, or on which it preys. This is obvious in the\\nstructure of the teeth and talons of the tiger; and in that of the legs and\\nclaws of the parasite which clings to the hair on the tiger\\'s body. But in\\nthe beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion, and in the flattened and\\nfringed legs of the water-beetle, the relation seems at first confined to\\nthe elements of air and water. Yet the advantage of plumed seeds no doubt\\nstands in the closest relation to the land being already thickly clothed by\\nother plants; so that the seeds may be widely distributed and fall on\\nunoccupied ground. In the water-beetle, the structure of its legs, so well\\nadapted for diving, allows it to compete with other aquatic insects, to\\nhunt for its own prey, and to escape serving as prey to other animals.\\n\\nThe store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at\\nfirst sight to have no sort of relation to other plants. But from the\\nstrong growth of young plants produced from such seeds (as peas and beans),\\nwhen sown in the midst of long grass, I suspect that the chief use of the\\nnutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the young seedling, whilst\\nstruggling with other plants growing vigorously all around.\\n\\nLook at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or\\nquadruple its numbers? We know {78} that it can perfectly well withstand a\\nlittle more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for elsewhere it ranges into\\nslightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts. In this case we can\\nclearly see that if we wished in imagination to give the plant the power of\\nincreasing in number, we should have to give it some advantage over its\\ncompetitors, or over the animals which preyed on it. On the confines of its\\ngeographical range, a change of constitution with respect to climate would\\nclearly be an advantage to our plant; but we have reason to believe that\\nonly a few plants or animals range so far, that they are destroyed by the\\nrigour of the climate alone. Not until we reach the extreme confines of\\nlife, in the Arctic regions or on the borders of an utter desert, will\\ncompetition cease. The land may be extremely cold or dry, yet there will be\\ncompetition between some few species, or between the individuals of the\\nsame species, for the warmest or dampest spots.\\n\\nHence, also, we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new\\ncountry amongst new competitors, though the climate may be exactly the same\\nas in its former home, yet the conditions of its life will generally be\\nchanged in an essential manner. If we wished to increase its average\\nnumbers in its new home, we should have to modify it in a different way to\\nwhat we should have done in its native country; for we should have to give\\nit some advantage over a different set of competitors or enemies.\\n\\nIt is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form some advantage\\nover another. Probably in no single instance should we know what to do, so\\nas to succeed. It will convince us of our ignorance on the mutual relations\\nof all organic beings; a conviction as necessary, as it seems to be\\ndifficult to acquire. All that we can do, is to keep steadily in mind that\\neach {79} organic being is striving to increase at a geometrical ratio;\\nthat each at some period of its life, during some season of the year,\\nduring each generation or at intervals, has to struggle for life, and to\\nsuffer great destruction. When we reflect on this struggle, we may console\\nourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant,\\nthat no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the\\nvigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{80}\\n\\nCHAPTER IV.\\n\\nNATURAL SELECTION.\\n\\n    Natural Selection--its power compared with man\\'s selection--its power\\n    on characters of trifling importance--its power at all ages and on both\\n    sexes--Sexual Selection--On the generality of intercrosses between\\n    individuals of the same species--Circumstances favourable and\\n    unfavourable to Natural Selection, namely, intercrossing, isolation,\\n    number of individuals--Slow action--Extinction caused by Natural\\n    Selection--Divergence of Character, related to the diversity of\\n    inhabitants of any small area, and to naturalisation--Action of Natural\\n    Selection, through Divergence of Character and Extinction, on the\\n    descendants from a common parent--Explains the Grouping of all organic\\n    beings.\\n\\nHow will the struggle for existence, discussed too briefly in the last\\nchapter, act in regard to variation? Can the principle of selection, which\\nwe have seen is so potent in the hands of man, apply in nature? I think we\\nshall see that it can act most effectually. Let it be borne in mind in what\\nan endless number of strange peculiarities our domestic productions, and,\\nin a lesser degree, those under nature, vary; and how strong the hereditary\\ntendency is. Under domestication, it may be truly said that the whole\\norganisation becomes in some degree plastic. Let it be borne in mind how\\ninfinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual relations of all\\norganic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life. Can\\nit, then, be thought improbable, seeing that variations useful to man have\\nundoubtedly occurred, that other variations useful in some way to each\\nbeing in the great and complex battle of life, should sometimes occur in\\nthe course of thousands of generations? If such do occur, can we doubt {81}\\n(remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive)\\nthat individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would\\nhave the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? On the\\nother hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree\\ninjurious would be rigidly destroyed. This preservation of favourable\\nvariations and the rejection of injurious variations, I call Natural\\nSelection. Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by\\nnatural selection, and would be left a fluctuating element, as perhaps we\\nsee in the species called polymorphic.\\n\\nWe shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking\\nthe case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of\\nclimate. The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost\\nimmediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct. We may\\nconclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in\\nwhich the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change\\nin the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants, independently of\\nthe change of climate itself, would seriously affect many of the others. If\\nthe country were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate,\\nand this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former\\ninhabitants. Let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single\\nintroduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. But in the case of an\\nisland, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and\\nbetter adapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in\\nthe economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up, if some of\\nthe original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area\\nbeen open to immigration, these same {82} places would have been seized on\\nby intruders. In such case, every slight modification, which in the course\\nof ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of\\nany of the species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions,\\nwould tend to be preserved; and natural selection would thus have free\\nscope for the work of improvement.\\n\\nWe have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a change in\\nthe conditions of life, by specially acting on the reproductive system,\\ncauses or increases variability; and in the foregoing case the conditions\\nof life are supposed to have undergone a change, and this would manifestly\\nbe favourable to natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable\\nvariations occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural\\nselection can do nothing. Not that, as I believe, any extreme amount of\\nvariability is necessary; as man can certainly produce great results by\\nadding up in any given direction mere individual differences, so could\\nNature, but far more easily, from having incomparably longer time at her\\ndisposal. Nor do I believe that any great physical change, as of climate,\\nor any unusual degree of isolation to check immigration, is actually\\nnecessary to produce new and unoccupied places for natural selection to\\nfill up by modifying and improving some of the varying inhabitants. For as\\nall the inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely\\nbalanced forces, extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits\\nof one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others; and still\\nfurther modifications of the same kind would often still further increase\\nthe advantage. No country can be named in which all the native inhabitants\\nare now so perfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions\\nunder which they live, that none of {83} them could anyhow be improved; for\\nin all countries, the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised\\nproductions, that they have allowed foreigners to take firm possession of\\nthe land. And as foreigners have thus everywhere beaten some of the\\nnatives, we may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified\\nwith advantage, so as to have better resisted such intruders.\\n\\nAs man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his\\nmethodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not Nature effect?\\nMan can act only on external and visible characters: Nature cares nothing\\nfor appearances, except in so far as they may be useful to any being. She\\ncan act on every internal organ, on every shade of constitutional\\ndifference, on the whole machinery of life. Man selects only for his own\\ngood; Nature only for that of the being which she tends. Every selected\\ncharacter is fully exercised by her; and the being is placed under\\nwell-suited conditions of life. Man keeps the natives of many climates in\\nthe same country; he seldom exercises each selected character in some\\npeculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on\\nthe same food; he does not exercise a long-backed or long-legged quadruped\\nin any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the\\nsame climate. He does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the\\nfemales. He does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals, but protects\\nduring each varying season, as far as lies in his power, all his\\nproductions. He often begins his selection by some half-monstrous form; or\\nat least by some modification prominent enough to catch his eye, or to be\\nplainly useful to him. Under nature, the slightest difference of structure\\nor constitution may well turn the nicely-balanced scale in the struggle for\\nlife, and so be {84} preserved. How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of\\nman! how short his time! and consequently how poor will his products be,\\ncompared with those accumulated by Nature during whole geological periods.\\nCan we wonder, then, that Nature\\'s productions should be far \"truer\" in\\ncharacter than man\\'s productions; that they should be infinitely better\\nadapted to the most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the\\nstamp of far higher workmanship?\\n\\nIt may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily and hourly\\nscrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest;\\nrejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good;\\nsilently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers,\\nat the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and\\ninorganic conditions of life. We see nothing of these slow changes in\\nprogress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages, and\\nthen so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages, that we only\\nsee that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were.\\n\\nAlthough natural selection can act only through and for the good of each\\nbeing, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to consider as of\\nvery trifling importance, may thus be acted on. When we see leaf-eating\\ninsects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white in\\nwinter, the red-grouse the colour of heather, and the black-grouse that of\\npeaty earth, we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds\\nand insects in preserving them from danger. Grouse, if not destroyed at\\nsome period of their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are\\nknown to suffer largely from birds of prey; and hawks are guided by\\neyesight to their prey--so much so, that on {85} parts of the Continent\\npersons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the most liable to\\ndestruction. Hence I can see no reason to doubt that natural selection\\nmight be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse,\\nand in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and constant. Nor\\nought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any\\nparticular colour would produce little effect: we should remember how\\nessential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy every lamb with the\\nfaintest trace of black. In plants the down on the fruit and the colour of\\nthe flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling\\nimportance: yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist, Downing, that in\\nthe United States smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle, a\\ncurculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far more from a\\ncertain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease attacks\\nyellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh. If,\\nwith all the aids of art, these slight differences make a great difference\\nin cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a state of nature,\\nwhere the trees would have to struggle with other trees and with a host of\\nenemies, such differences would effectually settle which variety, whether a\\nsmooth or downy, a yellow or purple fleshed fruit, should succeed.\\n\\nIn looking at many small points of difference between species, which, as\\nfar as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem quite unimportant, we must\\nnot forget that climate, food, &c., probably produce some slight and direct\\neffect. It is, however, far more necessary to bear in mind that there are\\nmany unknown laws of correlation of growth, which, when one part of the\\norganisation is modified through variation, and the modifications are\\naccumulated by natural selection for {86} the good of the being, will cause\\nother modifications, often of the most unexpected nature.\\n\\nAs we see that those variations which under domestication appear at any\\nparticular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at the same\\nperiod;--for instance, in the seeds of the many varieties of our culinary\\nand agricultural plants; in the caterpillar and cocoon stages of the\\nvarieties of the silkworm; in the eggs of poultry, and in the colour of the\\ndown of their chickens; in the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly\\nadult;--so in a state of nature, natural selection will be enabled to act\\non and modify organic beings at any age, by the accumulation of variations\\nprofitable at that age, and by their inheritance at a corresponding age. If\\nit profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by\\nthe wind, I can see no greater difficulty in this being effected through\\nnatural selection, than in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by\\nselection the down in the pods on his cotton-trees. Natural selection may\\nmodify and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies, wholly\\ndifferent from those which concern the mature insect. These modifications\\nwill no doubt affect, through the laws of correlation, the structure of the\\nadult; and probably in the case of those insects which live only for a few\\nhours, and which never feed, a large part of their structure is merely the\\ncorrelated result of successive changes in the structure of their larvГ¦.\\nSo, conversely, modifications in the adult will probably often affect the\\nstructure of the larva; but in all cases natural selection will ensure that\\nmodifications consequent on other modifications at a different period of\\nlife, shall not be in the least degree injurious: for if they became so,\\nthey would cause the extinction of the species.\\n\\nNatural selection will modify the structure of the {87} young in relation\\nto the parent, and of the parent in relation to the young. In social\\nanimals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of\\nthe community; if each in consequence profits by the selected change. What\\nnatural selection cannot do, is to modify the structure of one species,\\nwithout giving it any advantage, for the good of another species; and\\nthough statements to this effect may be found in works of natural history,\\nI cannot find one case which will bear investigation. A structure used only\\nonce in an animal\\'s whole life, if of high importance to it, might be\\nmodified to any extent by natural selection; for instance, the great jaws\\npossessed by certain insects, used exclusively for opening the cocoon--or\\nthe hard tip to the beak of nestling birds, used for breaking the egg. It\\nhas been asserted, that of the best short-beaked tumbler-pigeons more\\nperish in the egg than are able to get out of it; so that fanciers assist\\nin the act of hatching. Now, if nature had to make the beak of a full-grown\\npigeon very short for the bird\\'s own advantage, the process of modification\\nwould be very slow, and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous\\nselection of the young birds within the egg, which had the most powerful\\nand hardest beaks, for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish: or,\\nmore delicate and more easily broken shells might be selected, the\\nthickness of the shell being known to vary like every other structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Sexual Selection._--Inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under\\ndomestication in one sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex, the\\nsame fact probably occurs under nature, and if so, natural selection will\\nbe able to modify one sex in its functional relations to the other sex, or\\nin relation to wholly different habits of life in the two sexes, as is\\nsometimes the case {88} with insects. And this leads me to say a few words\\non what I call Sexual Selection. This depends, not on a struggle for\\nexistence, but on a struggle between the males for possession of the\\nfemales; the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or\\nno offspring. Sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than natural\\nselection. Generally, the most vigorous males, those which are best fitted\\nfor their places in nature, will leave most progeny. But in many cases,\\nvictory depends not on general vigour, but on having special weapons,\\nconfined to the male sex. A hornless stag or spurless cock would have a\\npoor chance of leaving offspring. Sexual selection by always allowing the\\nvictor to breed might surely give indomitable courage, length to the spur,\\nand strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg, as well as the\\nbrutal cock-fighter, who knows well that he can improve his breed by\\ncareful selection of the best cocks. How low in the scale of nature the law\\nof battle descends, I know not; male alligators have been described as\\nfighting, bellowing, and whirling round, like Indians in a war-dance, for\\nthe possession of the females; male salmons have been seen fighting all day\\nlong; male stag-beetles often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other\\nmales. The war is, perhaps, severest between the males of polygamous\\nanimals, and these seem oftenest provided with special weapons. The males\\nof carnivorous animals are already well armed; though to them and to\\nothers, special means of defence may be given through means of sexual\\nselection, as the mane to the lion, the shoulder-pad to the boar, and the\\nhooked jaw to the male salmon; for the shield may be as important for\\nvictory, as the sword or spear.\\n\\nAmongst birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character. All those\\nwho have attended to the subject, {89} believe that there is the severest\\nrivalry between the males of many species to attract by singing the\\nfemales. The rock-thrush of Guiana, birds of Paradise, and some others,\\ncongregate; and successive males display their gorgeous plumage and perform\\nstrange antics before the females, which, standing by as spectators, at\\nlast choose the most attractive partner. Those who have closely attended to\\nbirds in confinement well know that they often take individual preferences\\nand dislikes: thus Sir R. Heron has described how one pied peacock was\\neminently attractive to all his hen birds. It may appear childish to\\nattribute any effect to such apparently weak means: I cannot here enter on\\nthe details necessary to support this view; but if man can in a short time\\ngive elegant carriage and beauty to his bantams, according to his standard\\nof beauty, I can see no good reason to doubt that female birds, by\\nselecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious or beautiful\\nmales, according to their standard of beauty, might produce a marked\\neffect. I strongly suspect that some well-known laws, with respect to the\\nplumage of male and female birds, in comparison with the plumage of the\\nyoung, can be explained on the view of plumage having been chiefly modified\\nby sexual selection, acting when the birds have come to the breeding age or\\nduring the breeding season; the modifications thus produced being inherited\\nat corresponding ages or seasons, either by the males alone, or by the\\nmales and females; but I have not space here to enter on this subject.\\n\\nThus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any animal\\nhave the same general habits of life, but differ in structure, colour, or\\nornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection;\\nthat is, individual males have had, in successive generations, some slight\\nadvantage over other {90} males, in their weapons, means of defence, or\\ncharms; and have transmitted these advantages to their male offspring. Yet,\\nI would not wish to attribute all such sexual differences to this agency:\\nfor we see peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex in\\nour domestic animals (as the wattle in male carriers, horn-like\\nprotuberances in the cocks of certain fowls, &c.), which we cannot believe\\nto be either useful to the males in battle, or attractive to the females.\\nWe see analogous cases under nature, for instance, the tuft of hair on the\\nbreast of the turkey-cock, which can hardly be either useful or ornamental\\nto this bird;--indeed, had the tuft appeared under domestication, it would\\nhave been called a monstrosity.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Illustrations of the action of Natural Selection._--In order to make it\\nclear how, as I believe, natural selection acts, I must beg permission to\\ngive one or two imaginary illustrations. Let us take the case of a wolf,\\nwhich preys on various animals, securing some by craft, some by strength,\\nand some by fleetness; and let us suppose that the fleetest prey, a deer\\nfor instance, had from any change in the country increased in numbers, or\\nthat other prey had decreased in numbers, during that season of the year\\nwhen the wolf is hardest pressed for food. I can under such circumstances\\nsee no reason to doubt that the swiftest and slimmest wolves would have the\\nbest chance of surviving, and so be preserved or selected,--provided always\\nthat they retained strength to master their prey at this or at some other\\nperiod of the year, when they might be compelled to prey on other animals.\\nI can see no more reason to doubt this, than that man can improve the\\nfleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by that\\nunconscious selection which results from each man trying {91} to keep the\\nbest dogs without any thought of modifying the breed.\\n\\nEven without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on which\\nour wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency to pursue\\ncertain kinds of prey. Nor can this be thought very improbable; for we\\noften observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our domestic\\nanimals; one cat, for instance, taking to catch rats, another mice; one\\ncat, according to Mr. St. John, bringing home winged game, another hares or\\nrabbits, and another hunting on marshy ground and almost nightly catching\\nwoodcocks or snipes. The tendency to catch rats rather than mice is known\\nto be inherited. Now, if any slight innate change of habit or of structure\\nbenefited an individual wolf, it would have the best chance of surviving\\nand of leaving offspring. Some of its young would probably inherit the same\\nhabits or structure, and by the repetition of this process, a new variety\\nmight be formed which would either supplant or coexist with the parent form\\nof wolf. Or, again, the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district, and those\\nfrequenting the lowlands, would naturally be forced to hunt different prey;\\nand from the continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the\\ntwo sites, two varieties might slowly be formed. These varieties would\\ncross and blend where they met; but to this subject of intercrossing we\\nshall soon have to return. I may add, that, according to Mr. Pierce, there\\nare two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the Catskill Mountains in the\\nUnited States, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer,\\nand the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks\\nthe shepherd\\'s flocks.\\n\\nLet us now take a more complex case. Certain plants excrete a sweet juice,\\napparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from their sap:\\nthis is {92} effected by glands at the base of the stipules in some\\nLeguminosГ¦, and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel. This juice,\\nthough small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects. Let us now suppose\\na little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by the inner bases of the\\npetals of a flower. In this case insects in seeking the nectar would get\\ndusted with pollen, and would certainly often transport the pollen from one\\nflower to the stigma of another flower. The flowers of two distinct\\nindividuals of the same species would thus get crossed; and the act of\\ncrossing, we have good reason to believe (as will hereafter be more fully\\nalluded to), would produce very vigorous seedlings, which consequently\\nwould have the best chance of flourishing and surviving. Some of these\\nseedlings would probably inherit the nectar-excreting power. Those\\nindividual flowers which had the largest glands or nectaries, and which\\nexcreted most nectar, would be oftenest visited by insects, and would be\\noftenest crossed; and so in the long-run would gain the upper hand. Those\\nflowers, also, which had their stamens and pistils placed, in relation to\\nthe size and habits of the particular insects which visited them, so as to\\nfavour in any degree the transportal of their pollen from flower to flower,\\nwould likewise be favoured or selected. We might have taken the case of\\ninsects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of\\nnectar; and as pollen is formed for the sole object of fertilisation, its\\ndestruction appears a simple loss to the plant; yet if a little pollen were\\ncarried, at first occasionally and then habitually, by the pollen-devouring\\ninsects from flower to flower, and a cross thus effected, although\\nnine-tenths of the pollen were destroyed, it might still be a great gain to\\nthe plant; and those individuals which produced more and more pollen, and\\nhad larger and larger anthers, would be selected. {93}\\n\\nWhen our plant, by this process of the continued preservation or natural\\nselection of more and more attractive flowers, had been rendered highly\\nattractive to insects, they would, unintentionally on their part, regularly\\ncarry pollen from flower to flower; and that they can most effectually do\\nthis, I could easily show by many striking instances. I will give only\\none--not as a very striking case, but as likewise illustrating one step in\\nthe separation of the sexes of plants, presently to be alluded to. Some\\nholly-trees bear only male flowers, which have four stamens producing a\\nrather small quantity of pollen, and a rudimentary pistil; other\\nholly-trees bear only female flowers; these have a full-sized pistil, and\\nfour stamens with shrivelled anthers, in which not a grain of pollen can be\\ndetected. Having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a male tree,\\nI put the stigmas of twenty flowers, taken from different branches, under\\nthe microscope, and on all, without exception, there were pollen-grains,\\nand on some a profusion of pollen. As the wind had set for several days\\nfrom the female to the male tree, the pollen could not thus have been\\ncarried. The weather had been cold and boisterous, and therefore not\\nfavourable to bees, nevertheless every female flower which I examined had\\nbeen effectually fertilised by the bees, accidentally dusted with pollen,\\nhaving flown from tree to tree in search of nectar. But to return to our\\nimaginary case: as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive\\nto insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower, another\\nprocess might commence. No naturalist doubts the advantage of what has been\\ncalled the \"physiological division of labour;\" hence we may believe that it\\nwould be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one flower or\\non one whole plant, and pistils alone in {94} another flower or on another\\nplant. In plants under culture and placed under new conditions of life,\\nsometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs become more or\\nless impotent; now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree\\nunder nature, then as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to\\nflower, and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would\\nbe advantageous on the principle of the division of labour, individuals\\nwith this tendency more and more increased, would be continually favoured\\nor selected, until at last a complete separation of the sexes would be\\neffected.\\n\\nLet us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects in our imaginary case: we may\\nsuppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by\\ncontinued selection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects\\ndepended in main part on its nectar for food. I could give many facts,\\nshowing how anxious bees are to save time; for instance, their habit of\\ncutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers, which\\nthey can, with a very little more trouble, enter by the mouth. Bearing such\\nfacts in mind, I can see no reason to doubt that an accidental deviation in\\nthe size and form of the body, or in the curvature and length of the\\nproboscis, &c., far too slight to be appreciated by us, might profit a bee\\nor other insect, so that an individual so characterised would be able to\\nobtain its food more quickly, and so have a better chance of living and\\nleaving descendants. Its descendants would probably inherit a tendency to a\\nsimilar slight deviation of structure. The tubes of the corollas of the\\ncommon red and incarnate clovers (Trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not\\non a hasty glance appear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can easily\\nsuck the nectar out of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red\\n{95} clover, which is visited by humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of\\nthe red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the\\nhive-bee. Thus it might be a great advantage to the hive-bee to have a\\nslightly longer or differently constructed proboscis. On the other hand, I\\nhave found by experiment that the fertility of clover depends on bees\\nvisiting and moving parts of the corolla, so as to push the pollen on to\\nthe stigmatic surface. Hence, again, if humble-bees were to become rare in\\nany country, it might be a great advantage to the red clover to have a\\nshorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla, so that the hive-bee\\ncould visit its flowers. Thus I can understand how a flower and a bee might\\nslowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and\\nadapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued\\npreservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable\\ndeviations of structure.\\n\\nI am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in the\\nabove imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which were at\\nfirst urged against Sir Charles Lyell\\'s noble views on \"the modern changes\\nof the earth, as illustrative of geology;\" but we now seldom hear the\\naction, for instance, of the coast-waves, called a trifling and\\ninsignificant cause, when applied to the excavation of gigantic valleys or\\nto the formation of the longest lines of inland cliffs. Natural selection\\ncan act only by the preservation and accumulation of infinitesimally small\\ninherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being; and as\\nmodern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great\\nvalley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection, if it be a\\ntrue principle, banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic\\n{96} beings, or of any great and sudden modification in their structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n_On the Intercrossing of Individuals._--I must here introduce a short\\ndigression. In the case of animals and plants with separated sexes, it is\\nof course obvious that two individuals must always (with the exception of\\nthe curious and not well-understood cases of parthenogenesis) unite for\\neach birth; but in the case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious.\\nNevertheless I am strongly inclined to believe that with all hermaphrodites\\ntwo individuals, either occasionally or habitually, concur for the\\nreproduction of their kind. This view was first suggested by Andrew Knight.\\nWe shall presently see its importance; but I must here treat the subject\\nwith extreme brevity, though I have the materials prepared for an ample\\ndiscussion. All vertebrate animals, all insects, and some other large\\ngroups of animals, pair for each birth. Modern research has much diminished\\nthe number of supposed hermaphrodites, and of real hermaphrodites a large\\nnumber pair; that is, two individuals regularly unite for reproduction,\\nwhich is all that concerns us. But still there are many hermaphrodite\\nanimals which certainly do not habitually pair, and a vast majority of\\nplants are hermaphrodites. What reason, it may be asked, is there for\\nsupposing in these cases that two individuals ever concur in reproduction?\\nAs it is impossible here to enter on details, I must trust to some general\\nconsiderations alone.\\n\\nIn the first place, I have collected so large a body of facts, showing, in\\naccordance with the almost universal belief of breeders, that with animals\\nand plants a cross between different varieties, or between individuals of\\nthe same variety but of another strain, gives vigour and {97} fertility to\\nthe offspring; and on the other hand, that _close_ interbreeding diminishes\\nvigour and fertility; that these facts alone incline me to believe that it\\nis a general law of nature (utterly ignorant though we be of the meaning of\\nthe law) that no organic being self-fertilises itself for an eternity of\\ngenerations; but that a cross with another individual is\\noccasionally--perhaps at very long intervals--indispensable.\\n\\nOn the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, I think, understand\\nseveral large classes of facts, such as the following, which on any other\\nview are inexplicable. Every hybridizer knows how unfavourable exposure to\\nwet is to the fertilisation of a flower, yet what a multitude of flowers\\nhave their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the weather! but if an\\noccasional cross be indispensable, the fullest freedom for the entrance of\\npollen from another individual will explain this state of exposure, more\\nespecially as the plant\\'s own anthers and pistil generally stand so close\\ntogether that self-fertilisation seems almost inevitable. Many flowers, on\\nthe other hand, have their organs of fructification closely enclosed, as in\\nthe great papilionaceous or pea-family; but in several, perhaps in all,\\nsuch flowers, there is a very curious adaptation between the structure of\\nthe flower and the manner in which bees suck the nectar; for, in doing\\nthis, they either push the flower\\'s own pollen on the stigma, or bring\\npollen from another flower. So necessary are the visits of bees to\\npapilionaceous flowers, that I have found, by experiments published\\nelsewhere, that their fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be\\nprevented. Now, it is scarcely possible that bees should fly from flower to\\nflower, and not carry pollen from one to the other, to the great good, as I\\nbelieve, of the plant. Bees will act like a camel-hair pencil, and it is\\nquite sufficient just to touch the anthers of {98} one flower and then the\\nstigma of another with the same brush to ensure fertilisation; but it must\\nnot be supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between\\ndistinct species; for if you bring on the same brush a plant\\'s own pollen\\nand pollen from another species, the former will have such a prepotent\\neffect, that it will invariably and completely destroy, as has been shown\\nby GГ¤rtner, any influence from the foreign pollen.\\n\\nWhen the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil, or slowly\\nmove one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems adapted solely\\nto ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it is useful for this end: but,\\nthe agency of insects is often required to cause the stamens to spring\\nforward, as KГ¶lreuter has shown to be the case with the barberry; and in\\nthis very genus, which seems to have a special contrivance for\\nself-fertilisation, it is well known that if closely-allied forms or\\nvarieties are planted near each other, it is hardly possible to raise pure\\nseedlings, so largely do they naturally cross. In many other cases, far\\nfrom there being any aids for self-fertilisation, there are special\\ncontrivances, as I could show from the writings of C. C. Sprengel and from\\nmy own observations, which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen\\nfrom its own flower: for instance, in Lobelia fulgens, there is a really\\nbeautiful and elaborate contrivance by which every one of the infinitely\\nnumerous pollen-granules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each\\nflower, before the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive\\nthem; and as this flower is never visited, at least in my garden, by\\ninsects, it never sets a seed, though by placing pollen from one flower on\\nthe stigma of another, I raised plenty of seedlings; and whilst another\\nspecies of Lobelia growing close by, which is visited by bees, seeds\\nfreely. In very many other cases, though there {99} be no special\\nmechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma of a flower receiving its own\\npollen, yet, as C. C. Sprengel has shown, and as I can confirm, either the\\nanthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the stigma\\nis ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that these plants\\nhave in fact separated sexes, and must habitually be crossed. How strange\\nare these facts! How strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the\\nsame flower, though placed so close together, as if for the very purpose of\\nself-fertilisation, should in so many cases be mutually useless to each\\nother! How simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional\\ncross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable!\\n\\nIf several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some other\\nplants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority, as I have\\nfound, of the seedlings thus raised will turn out mongrels: for instance, I\\nraised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties\\ngrowing near each other, and of these only 78 were true to their kind, and\\nsome even of these were not perfectly true. Yet the pistil of each\\ncabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens, but by those\\nof the many other flowers on the same plant. How, then, comes it that such\\na vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized? I suspect that it must\\narise from the pollen of a distinct _variety_ having a prepotent effect\\nover a flower\\'s own pollen; and that this is part of the general law of\\ngood being derived from the intercrossing of distinct individuals of the\\nsame species. When distinct _species_ are crossed the case is directly the\\nreverse, for a plant\\'s own pollen is always prepotent over foreign pollen;\\nbut to this subject we shall return in a future chapter.\\n\\nIn the case of a gigantic tree covered with, {100} innumerable flowers, it\\nmay be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree, and\\nat most only from flower to flower on the same tree, and that flowers on\\nthe same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited\\nsense. I believe this objection to be valid, but that nature has largely\\nprovided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear flowers\\nwith separated sexes. When the sexes are separated, although the male and\\nfemale flowers may be produced on the same tree, we can see that pollen\\nmust be regularly carried from flower to flower; and this will give a\\nbetter chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree. That\\ntrees belonging to all Orders have their sexes more often separated than\\nother plants, I find to be the case in this country; and at my request Dr.\\nHooker tabulated the trees of New Zealand, and Dr. Asa Gray those of the\\nUnited States, and the result was as I anticipated. On the other hand, Dr.\\nHooker has recently informed me that he finds that the rule does not hold\\nin Australia; and I have made these few remarks on the sexes of trees\\nsimply to call attention to the subject.\\n\\nTurning for a very brief space to animals: on the land there are some\\nhermaphrodites, as land-mollusca and earth-worms; but these all pair. As\\nyet I have not found a single case of a terrestrial animal which fertilises\\nitself. We can understand this remarkable fact, which offers so strong a\\ncontrast with terrestrial plants, on the view of an occasional cross being\\nindispensable, by considering the medium in which terrestrial animals live,\\nand the nature of the fertilising element; for we know of no means,\\nanalogous to the action of insects and of the wind in the case of plants,\\nby which an occasional cross could be effected with terrestrial animals\\nwithout the concurrence of two individuals. Of aquatic animals, there are\\nmany self-fertilising hermaphrodites; but here {101} currents in the water\\noffer an obvious means for an occasional cross. And, as in the case of\\nflowers, I have as yet failed, after consultation with one of the highest\\nauthorities, namely, Professor Huxley, to discover a single case of an\\nhermaphrodite animal with the organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed\\nwithin the body, that access from without and the occasional influence of a\\ndistinct individual can be shown to be physically impossible. Cirripedes\\nlong appeared to me to present a case of very great difficulty under this\\npoint of view; but I have been enabled, by a fortunate chance, elsewhere to\\nprove that two individuals, though both are self-fertilising\\nhermaphrodites, do sometimes cross.\\n\\nIt must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that, in the case\\nof both animals and plants, species of the same family and even of the same\\ngenus, though agreeing closely with each other in almost their whole\\norganisation, yet are not rarely, some of them hermaphrodites, and some of\\nthem unisexual. But if, in fact, all hermaphrodites do occasionally\\nintercross with other individuals, the difference between hermaphrodites\\nand unisexual species, as far as function is concerned, becomes very small.\\n\\nFrom these several considerations and from the many special facts which I\\nhave collected, but which I am not here able to give, I am strongly\\ninclined to suspect that, both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, an\\noccasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law of nature. I am\\nwell aware that there are, on this view, many cases of difficulty, some of\\nwhich I am trying to investigate. Finally then, we may conclude that in\\nmany organic beings, a cross between two individuals is an obvious\\nnecessity for each birth; in many others it occurs perhaps only at long\\nintervals; but in none, as I suspect, can self-fertilisation go on for\\nperpetuity. {102}\\n\\n\\n\\n_Circumstances favourable to Natural Selection._--This is an extremely\\nintricate subject. A large amount of inheritable and diversified\\nvariability is favourable, but I believe mere individual differences\\nsuffice for the work. A large number of individuals, by giving a better\\nchance for the appearance within any given period of profitable variations,\\nwill compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each individual, and\\nis, I believe, an extremely important element of success. Though nature\\ngrants vast periods of time for the work of natural selection, she does not\\ngrant an indefinite period; for as all organic beings are striving, it may\\nbe said, to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if any one\\nspecies does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree\\nwith its competitors, it will soon be exterminated.\\n\\nIn man\\'s methodical selection, a breeder selects for some definite object,\\nand free intercrossing will wholly stop his work. But when many men,\\nwithout intending to alter the breed, have a nearly common standard of\\nperfection, and all try to get and breed from the best animals, much\\nimprovement and modification surely but slowly follow from this unconscious\\nprocess of selection, notwithstanding a large amount of crossing with\\ninferior animals. Thus it will be in nature; for within a confined area,\\nwith some place in its polity not so perfectly occupied as might be,\\nnatural selection will always tend to preserve all the individuals varying\\nin the right direction, though in different degrees, so as better to fill\\nup the unoccupied place. But if the area be large, its several districts\\nwill almost certainly present different conditions of life; and then if\\nnatural selection be modifying and improving a species in the several\\ndistricts, there will be intercrossing with the other individuals of the\\nsame species on the confines of each. And in {103} this case the effects of\\nintercrossing can hardly be counterbalanced by natural selection always\\ntending to modify all the individuals in each district in exactly the same\\nmanner to the conditions of each; for in a continuous area, the physical\\nconditions at least will generally graduate away insensibly from one\\ndistrict to another. The intercrossing will most affect those animals which\\nunite for each birth, which wander much, and which do not breed at a very\\nquick rate. Hence in animals of this nature, for instance in birds,\\nvarieties will generally be confined to separated countries; and this I\\nbelieve to be the case. In hermaphrodite organisms which cross only\\noccasionally, and likewise in animals which unite for each birth, but which\\nwander little and which can increase at a very rapid rate, a new and\\nimproved variety might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might there\\nmaintain itself in a body, so that whatever intercrossing took place would\\nbe chiefly between the individuals of the same new variety. A local variety\\nwhen once thus formed might subsequently slowly spread to other districts.\\nOn the above principle, nurserymen always prefer getting seed from a large\\nbody of plants of the same variety, as the chance of intercrossing with\\nother varieties is thus lessened.\\n\\nEven in the case of slow-breeding animals, which unite for each birth, we\\nmust not overrate the effects of intercrosses in retarding natural\\nselection; for I can bring a considerable catalogue of facts, showing that\\nwithin the same area, varieties of the same animal can long remain\\ndistinct, from haunting different stations, from breeding at slightly\\ndifferent seasons, or from varieties of the same kind preferring to pair\\ntogether.\\n\\nIntercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping the\\nindividuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and uniform\\nin character. It will {104} obviously thus act far more efficiently with\\nthose animals which unite for each birth; but I have already attempted to\\nshow that we have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place\\nwith all animals and with all plants. Even if these take place only at long\\nintervals, I am convinced that the young thus produced will gain so much in\\nvigour and fertility over the offspring from long-continued\\nself-fertilisation, that they will have a better chance of surviving and\\npropagating their kind; and thus, in the long run, the influence of\\nintercrosses, even at rare intervals, will be great. If there exist organic\\nbeings which never intercross, uniformity of character can be retained\\namongst them, as long as their conditions of life remain the same, only\\nthrough the principle of inheritance, and through natural selection\\ndestroying any which depart from the proper type; but if their conditions\\nof life change and they undergo modification, uniformity of character can\\nbe given to their modified offspring, solely by natural selection\\npreserving the same favourable variations.\\n\\nIsolation, also, is an important element in the process of natural\\nselection. In a confined or isolated area, if not very large, the organic\\nand inorganic conditions of life will generally be in a great degree\\nuniform; so that natural selection will tend to modify all the individuals\\nof a varying species throughout the area in the same manner in relation to\\nthe same conditions. Intercrosses, also, with the individuals of the same\\nspecies, which otherwise would have inhabited the surrounding and\\ndifferently circumstanced districts, will be prevented. But isolation\\nprobably acts more efficiently in checking the immigration of better\\nadapted organisms, after any physical change, such as of climate or\\nelevation of the land, &c.; and thus new places in the natural economy of\\nthe country are left open for the old inhabitants to struggle for, and\\nbecome adapted to, through {105} modifications in their structure and\\nconstitution. Lastly, isolation, by checking immigration and consequently\\ncompetition, will give time for any new variety to be slowly improved; and\\nthis may sometimes be of importance in the production of new species. If,\\nhowever, an isolated area be very small, either from being surrounded by\\nbarriers, or from having very peculiar physical conditions, the total\\nnumber of the individuals supported on it will necessarily be very small;\\nand fewness of individuals will greatly retard the production of new\\nspecies through natural selection, by decreasing the chance of the\\nappearance of favourable variations.\\n\\nIf we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and look at any\\nsmall isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the total number\\nof the species inhabiting it, will be found to be small, as we shall see in\\nour chapter on geographical distribution; yet of these species a very large\\nproportion are endemic,--that is, have been produced there, and nowhere\\nelse. Hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly\\nfavourable for the production of new species. But we may thus greatly\\ndeceive ourselves, for to ascertain whether a small isolated area, or a\\nlarge open area like a continent, has been most favourable for the\\nproduction of new organic forms, we ought to make the comparison within\\nequal times; and this we are incapable of doing.\\n\\nAlthough I do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importance in the\\nproduction of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that\\nlargeness of area is of more importance, more especially in the production\\nof species, which will prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of\\nspreading widely. Throughout a great and open area, not only will there be\\na better chance of favourable variations arising from the large number of\\nindividuals of the same species {106} there supported, but the conditions\\nof life are infinitely complex from the large number of already existing\\nspecies; and if some of these many species become modified and improved,\\nothers will have to be improved in a corresponding degree or they will be\\nexterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been much improved,\\nwill be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus\\ncome into competition with many others. Hence more new places will be\\nformed, and the competition to fill them will be more severe, on a large\\nthan on a small and isolated area. Moreover, great areas, though now\\ncontinuous, owing to oscillations of level, will often have recently\\nexisted in a broken condition, so that the good effects of isolation will\\ngenerally, to a certain extent, have concurred. Finally, I conclude that,\\nalthough small isolated areas probably have been in some respects highly\\nfavourable for the production of new species, yet that the course of\\nmodification will generally have been more rapid on large areas; and what\\nis more important, that the new forms produced on large areas, which\\nalready have been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will\\nspread most widely, will give rise to most new varieties and species, and\\nwill thus play an important part in the changing history of the organic\\nworld.\\n\\nWe can, perhaps, on these views, understand some facts which will be again\\nalluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution; for instance, that\\nthe productions of the smaller continent of Australia have formerly\\nyielded, and apparently are now yielding, before those of the larger\\nEuropГ¦o-Asiatic area. Thus, also, it is that continental productions have\\neverywhere become so largely naturalised on islands. On a small island, the\\nrace for life will have been less severe, and there will have been less\\nmodification and less {107} extermination. Hence, perhaps, it comes that\\nthe flora of Madeira, according to Oswald Heer, resembles the extinct\\ntertiary flora of Europe. All fresh-water basins, taken together, make a\\nsmall area compared with that of the sea or of the land; and, consequently,\\nthe competition between fresh-water productions will have been less severe\\nthan elsewhere; new forms will have been more slowly formed, and old forms\\nmore slowly exterminated. And it is in fresh water that we find seven\\ngenera of Ganoid fishes, remnants of a once preponderant order: and in\\nfresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the\\nworld, as the Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren, which, like fossils, connect\\nto a certain extent orders now widely separated in the natural scale. These\\nanomalous forms may almost be called living fossils; they have endured to\\nthe present day, from having inhabited a confined area, and from having\\nthus been exposed to less severe competition.\\n\\nTo sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural\\nselection, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits. I\\nconclude, looking to the future, that for terrestrial productions a large\\ncontinental area, which will probably undergo many oscillations of level,\\nand which consequently will exist for long periods in a broken condition,\\nis the most favourable for the production of many new forms of life, likely\\nto endure long and to spread widely. For the area first existed as a\\ncontinent, and the inhabitants, at this period numerous in individuals and\\nkinds, will have been subjected to very severe competition. When converted\\nby subsidence into large separate islands, there will still exist many\\nindividuals of the same species on each island: intercrossing on the\\nconfines of the range of each species will thus be checked: after physical\\nchanges of any kind, immigration will be {108} prevented, so that new\\nplaces in the polity of each island will have to be filled up by\\nmodifications of the old inhabitants; and time will be allowed for the\\nvarieties in each to become well modified and perfected. When, by renewed\\nelevation, the islands shall be re-converted into a continental area, there\\nwill again be severe competition: the most favoured or improved varieties\\nwill be enabled to spread: there will be much extinction of the less\\nimproved forms, and the relative proportional numbers of the various\\ninhabitants of the renewed continent will again be changed; and again there\\nwill be a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the\\ninhabitants, and thus produce new species.\\n\\nThat natural selection will always act with extreme slowness, I fully\\nadmit. Its action depends on there being places in the polity of nature,\\nwhich can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the country\\nundergoing modification of some kind. The existence of such places will\\noften depend on physical changes, which are generally very slow, and on the\\nimmigration of better adapted forms having been checked. But the action of\\nnatural selection will probably still oftener depend on some of the\\ninhabitants becoming slowly modified; the mutual relations of many of the\\nother inhabitants being thus disturbed. Nothing can be effected, unless\\nfavourable variations occur, and variation itself is apparently always a\\nvery slow process. The process will often be greatly retarded by free\\nintercrossing. Many will exclaim that these several causes are amply\\nsufficient wholly to stop the action of natural selection. I do not believe\\nso. On the other hand, I do believe that natural selection always acts very\\nslowly, often only at long intervals of time, and generally on only a very\\nfew of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time. I further\\nbelieve, that this very slow, {109} intermittent action of natural\\nselection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and\\nmanner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed.\\n\\nSlow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much by\\nhis powers of artificial selection, I can see no limit to the amount of\\nchange, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between\\nall organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of\\nlife, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature\\'s power of\\nselection.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Extinction._--This subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on\\nGeology; but it must be here alluded to from being intimately connected\\nwith natural selection. Natural selection acts solely through the\\npreservation of variations in some way advantageous, which consequently\\nendure. But as from the high geometrical ratio of increase of all organic\\nbeings, each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, it follows\\nthat as each selected and favoured form increases in number, so will the\\nless favoured forms decrease and become rare. Rarity, as geology tells us,\\nis the precursor to extinction. We can, also, see that any form represented\\nby few individuals will, during fluctuations in the seasons or in the\\nnumber of its enemies, run a good chance of utter extinction. But we may go\\nfurther than this; for as new forms are continually and slowly being\\nproduced, unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes on\\nperpetually and almost indefinitely increasing, numbers inevitably must\\nbecome extinct. That the number of specific forms has not indefinitely\\nincreased, geology shows us plainly; and indeed we can see reason why they\\nshould not have thus increased, for the number of places in the polity of\\nnature is not indefinitely great,--not that we {110} have any means of\\nknowing that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species. Probably\\nno region is as yet fully stocked, for at the Cape of Good Hope, where more\\nspecies of plants are crowded together than in any other quarter of the\\nworld, some foreign plants have become naturalised, without causing, as far\\nas we know, the extinction of any natives.\\n\\nFurthermore, the species which are most numerous in individuals will have\\nthe best chance of producing within any given period favourable variations.\\nWe have evidence of this, in the facts given in the second chapter, showing\\nthat it is the common species which afford the greatest number of recorded\\nvarieties, or incipient species. Hence, rare species will be less quickly\\nmodified or improved within any given period, and they will consequently be\\nbeaten in the race for life by the modified descendants of the commoner\\nspecies.\\n\\nFrom these several considerations I think it inevitably follows, that as\\nnew species in the course of time are formed through natural selection,\\nothers will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct. The forms which\\nstand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and\\nimprovement, will naturally suffer most. And we have seen in the chapter on\\nthe Struggle for Existence that it is the most closely-allied\\nforms,--varieties of the same species, and species of the same genus or of\\nrelated genera,--which, from having nearly the same structure,\\nconstitution, and habits, generally come into the severest competition with\\neach other. Consequently, each new variety or species, during the progress\\nof its formation, will generally press hardest on its nearest kindred, and\\ntend to exterminate them. We see the same process of extermination amongst\\nour domesticated productions, through the selection of improved forms by\\nman. Many curious {111} instances could be given showing how quickly new\\nbreeds of cattle, sheep, and other animals, and varieties of flowers, take\\nthe place of older and inferior kinds. In Yorkshire, it is historically\\nknown that the ancient black cattle were displaced by the long-horns, and\\nthat these \"were swept away by the short-horns\" (I quote the words of an\\nagricultural writer) \"as if by some murderous pestilence.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n_Divergence of Character._--The principle, which I have designated by this\\nterm, is of high importance on my theory, and explains, as I believe,\\nseveral important facts. In the first place, varieties, even\\nstrongly-marked ones, though having somewhat of the character of\\nspecies--as is shown by the hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank\\nthem--yet certainly differ from each other far less than do good and\\ndistinct species. Nevertheless, according to my view, varieties are species\\nin the process of formation, or are, as I have called them, incipient\\nspecies. How, then, does the lesser difference between varieties become\\naugmented into the greater difference between species? That this does\\nhabitually happen, we must infer from most of the innumerable species\\nthroughout nature presenting well-marked differences; whereas varieties,\\nthe supposed prototypes and parents of future well-marked species, present\\nslight and ill-defined differences. Mere chance, as we may call it, might\\ncause one variety to differ in some character from its parents, and the\\noffspring of this variety again to differ from its parent in the very same\\ncharacter and in a greater degree; but this alone would never account for\\nso habitual and large an amount of difference as that between varieties of\\nthe same species and species of the same genus.\\n\\nAs has always been my practice, let us seek light on {112} this head from\\nour domestic productions. We shall here find something analogous. A fancier\\nis struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak; another fancier is\\nstruck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak; and on the acknowledged\\nprinciple that \"fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard, but\\nlike extremes,\" they both go on (as has actually occurred with\\ntumbler-pigeons) choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer\\nbeaks, or with shorter and shorter beaks. Again, we may suppose that at an\\nearly period one man preferred swifter horses; another stronger and more\\nbulky horses. The early differences would be very slight; in the course of\\ntime, from the continued selection of swifter horses by some breeders, and\\nof stronger ones by others, the differences would become greater, and would\\nbe noted as forming two sub-breeds; finally, after the lapse of centuries,\\nthe sub-breeds would become converted into two well-established and\\ndistinct breeds. As the differences slowly become greater, the inferior\\nanimals with intermediate characters, being neither very swift nor very\\nstrong, will have been neglected, and will have tended to disappear. Here,\\nthen, we see in man\\'s productions the action of what may be called the\\nprinciple of divergence, causing differences, at first barely appreciable,\\nsteadily to increase, and the breeds to diverge in character both from each\\nother and from their common parent.\\n\\nBut how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature? I\\nbelieve it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple\\ncircumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species\\nbecome in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be\\nbetter enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity\\nof nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers. {113}\\n\\nWe can clearly see this in the case of animals with simple habits. Take the\\ncase of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the number that can be supported\\nin any country has long ago arrived at its full average. If its natural\\npowers of increase be allowed to act, it can succeed in increasing (the\\ncountry not undergoing any change in its conditions) only by its varying\\ndescendants seizing on places at present occupied by other animals: some of\\nthem, for instance, being enabled to feed on new kinds of prey, either dead\\nor alive; some inhabiting new stations, climbing trees, frequenting water,\\nand some perhaps becoming less carnivorous. The more diversified in habits\\nand structure the descendants of our carnivorous animal became, the more\\nplaces they would be enabled to occupy. What applies to one animal will\\napply throughout all time to all animals--that is, if they vary--for\\notherwise natural selection can do nothing. So it will be with plants. It\\nhas been experimentally proved, that if a plot of ground be sown with one\\nspecies of grass, and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera\\nof grasses, a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage\\ncan thus be raised. The same has been found to hold good when first one\\nvariety and then several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on equal\\nspaces of ground. Hence, if any one species of grass were to go on varying,\\nand those varieties were continually selected which differed from each\\nother in at all the same manner as distinct species and genera of grasses\\ndiffer from each other, a greater number of individual plants of this\\nspecies of grass, including its modified descendants, would succeed in\\nliving on the same piece of ground. And we well know that each species and\\neach variety of grass is annually sowing almost countless seeds; and thus,\\nas it may be said, is striving its utmost to increase its numbers. {114}\\nConsequently, I cannot doubt that in the course of many thousands of\\ngenerations, the most distinct varieties of any one species of grass would\\nalways have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing in numbers, and\\nthus of supplanting the less distinct varieties; and varieties, when\\nrendered very distinct from each other, take the rank of species.\\n\\nThe truth of the principle, that the greatest amount of life can be\\nsupported by great diversification of structure, is seen under many natural\\ncircumstances. In an extremely small area, especially if freely open to\\nimmigration, and where the contest between individual and individual must\\nbe severe, we always find great diversity in its inhabitants. For instance,\\nI found that a piece of turf, three feet by four in size, which had been\\nexposed for many years to exactly the same conditions, supported twenty\\nspecies of plants, and these belonged to eighteen genera and to eight\\norders, which shows how much these plants differed from each other. So it\\nis with the plants and insects on small and uniform islets; and so in small\\nponds of fresh water. Farmers find that they can raise most food by a\\nrotation of plants belonging to the most different orders: nature follows\\nwhat may be called a simultaneous rotation. Most of the animals and plants\\nwhich live close round any small piece of ground, could live on it\\n(supposing it not to be in any way peculiar in its nature), and may be said\\nto be striving to the utmost to live there; but, it is seen, that where\\nthey come into the closest competition with each other, the advantages of\\ndiversification of structure, with the accompanying differences of habit\\nand constitution, determine that the inhabitants, which thus jostle each\\nother most closely, shall, as a general rule, belong to what we call\\ndifferent genera and orders.\\n\\nThe same principle is seen in the naturalisation of {115} plants through\\nman\\'s agency in foreign lands. It might have been expected that the plants\\nwhich have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would generally\\nhave been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are commonly looked at\\nas specially created and adapted for their own country. It might, also,\\nperhaps have been expected that naturalised plants would have belonged to a\\nfew groups more especially adapted to certain stations in their new homes.\\nBut the case is very different; and Alph. De Candolle has well remarked in\\nhis great and admirable work, that floras gain by naturalisation,\\nproportionally with the number of the native genera and species, far more\\nin new genera than in new species. To give a single instance: in the last\\nedition of Dr. Asa Gray\\'s \\'Manual of the Flora of the Northern United\\nStates,\\' 260 naturalised plants are enumerated, and these belong to 162\\ngenera. We thus see that these naturalised plants are of a highly\\ndiversified nature. They differ, moreover, to a large extent from the\\nindigenes, for out of the 162 genera, no less than 100 genera are not there\\nindigenous, and thus a large proportional addition is made to the genera of\\nthese States.\\n\\nBy considering the nature of the plants or animals which have struggled\\nsuccessfully with the indigenes of any country, and have there become\\nnaturalised, we may gain some crude idea in what manner some of the natives\\nwould have to be modified, in order to gain an advantage over the other\\nnatives; and we may at least safely infer that diversification of\\nstructure, amounting to new generic differences, would be profitable to\\nthem.\\n\\nThe advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same region is,\\nin fact, the same as that of the physiological division of labour in the\\norgans of the same individual body--a subject so well elucidated by Milne\\n{116} Edwards. No physiologist doubts that a stomach adapted to digest\\nvegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws most nutriment from these\\nsubstances. So in the general economy of any land, the more widely and\\nperfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different habits of\\nlife, so will a greater number of individuals be capable of there\\nsupporting themselves. A set of animals, with their organisation but little\\ndiversified, could hardly compete with a set more perfectly diversified in\\nstructure. It may be doubted, for instance, whether the Australian\\nmarsupials, which are divided into groups differing but little from each\\nother, and feebly representing, as Mr. Waterhouse and others have remarked,\\nour carnivorous, ruminant, and rodent mammals, could successfully compete\\nwith these well-pronounced orders. In the Australian mammals, we see the\\nprocess of diversification in an early and incomplete stage of development.\\n\\nAfter the foregoing discussion, which ought to have been much amplified, we\\nmay, I think, assume that the modified descendants of any one species will\\nsucceed by so much the better as they become more diversified in structure,\\nand are thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings. Now\\nlet us see how this principle of benefit being derived from divergence of\\ncharacter, combined with the principles of natural selection and of\\nextinction, will tend to act.\\n\\nThe accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather\\nperplexing subject. Let A to L represent the species of a genus large in\\nits own country; these species are supposed to resemble each other in\\nunequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature, and as is\\nrepresented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances. I\\nhave said a large genus, because we have seen in the second chapter, {117}\\nthat on an average more of the species of large genera vary than of small\\ngenera; and the varying species of the large genera present a greater\\nnumber of varieties. We have, also, seen that the species, which are the\\ncommonest and the most widely-diffused, vary more than rare species with\\nrestricted ranges. Let (A) be a common, widely-diffused, and varying\\nspecies, belonging to a genus large in its own country. The little fan of\\ndiverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from (A), may\\nrepresent its varying offspring. The variations are supposed to be\\nextremely slight, but of the most diversified nature; they are not supposed\\nall to appear simultaneously, but often after long intervals of time; nor\\nare they all supposed to endure for equal periods. Only those variations\\nwhich are in some way profitable will be preserved or naturally selected.\\nAnd here the importance of the principle of benefit being derived from\\ndivergence of character comes in; for this will generally lead to the most\\ndifferent or divergent variations (represented by the outer dotted lines)\\nbeing preserved and accumulated by natural selection. When a dotted line\\nreaches one of the horizontal lines, and is there marked by a small\\nnumbered letter, a sufficient amount of variation is supposed to have been\\naccumulated to have formed a fairly well-marked variety, such as would be\\nthought worthy of record in a systematic work.\\n\\n[Illustration]\\n\\nThe intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram, may represent\\neach a thousand generations; but it would have been better if each had\\nrepresented ten thousand generations. After a thousand generations, species\\n(A) is supposed to have produced two fairly well-marked varieties, namely\\na^1 and m^1. These two varieties will generally continue to be exposed to\\nthe same conditions which made their parents variable, {118} and the\\ntendency to variability is in itself hereditary, consequently they will\\ntend to vary, and generally to vary in nearly the same manner as their\\nparents varied. Moreover, these two varieties, being only slightly modified\\nforms, will tend to inherit those advantages which made their parent (A)\\nmore numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same country; they\\nwill likewise partake of those more general advantages which made the genus\\nto which the parent-species belonged, a large genus in its own country. And\\nthese circumstances we know to be favourable to the production of new\\nvarieties.\\n\\nIf, then, these two varieties be variable, the most divergent of their\\nvariations will generally be preserved during the next thousand\\ngenerations. And after this interval, variety a^1 is supposed in the\\ndiagram to have produced variety a^2, which will, owing to the principle of\\ndivergence, differ more from (A) than did variety a^1. Variety m^1 is\\nsupposed to have produced two varieties, namely m^2 and s^2, differing from\\neach other, and more considerably from their common parent (A). We may\\ncontinue the process by similar steps for any length of time; some of the\\nvarieties, after each thousand generations, producing only a single\\nvariety, but in a more and more modified condition, some producing two or\\nthree varieties, and some failing to produce any. Thus the varieties or\\nmodified descendants, proceeding from the common parent (A), will generally\\ngo on increasing in number and diverging in character. In the diagram the\\nprocess is represented up to the ten-thousandth generation, and under a\\ncondensed and simplified form up to the fourteen-thousandth generation.\\n\\nBut I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever goes on\\nso regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in itself made\\nsomewhat irregular. {119} I am far from thinking that the most divergent\\nvarieties will invariably prevail and multiply: a medium form may often\\nlong endure, and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant;\\nfor natural selection will always act according to the nature of the places\\nwhich are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings; and\\nthis will depend on infinitely complex relations. But as a general rule,\\nthe more diversified in structure the descendants from any one species can\\nbe rendered, the more places they will be enabled to seize on, and the more\\ntheir modified progeny will be increased. In our diagram the line of\\nsuccession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered letters marking\\nthe successive forms which have become sufficiently distinct to be recorded\\nas varieties. But these breaks are imaginary, and might have been inserted\\nanywhere, after intervals long enough to have allowed the accumulation of a\\nconsiderable amount of divergent variation.\\n\\nAs all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused species,\\nbelonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the same advantages\\nwhich made their parent successful in life, they will generally go on\\nmultiplying in number as well as diverging in character: this is\\nrepresented in the diagram by the several divergent branches proceeding\\nfrom (A). The modified offspring from the later and more highly improved\\nbranches in the lines of descent, will, it is probable, often take the\\nplace of, and so destroy, the earlier and less improved branches: this is\\nrepresented in the diagram by some of the lower branches not reaching to\\nthe upper horizontal lines. In some cases I do not doubt that the process\\nof modification will be confined to a single line of descent, and the\\nnumber of the descendants will not be increased; although the amount {120}\\nof divergent modification may have been increased in the successive\\ngenerations. This case would be represented in the diagram, if all the\\nlines proceeding from (A) were removed, excepting that from a^1 to a^{10}.\\nIn the same way, for instance, the English race-horse and English pointer\\nhave apparently both gone on slowly diverging in character from their\\noriginal stocks, without either having given off any fresh branches or\\nraces.\\n\\nAfter ten thousand generations, species (A) is supposed to have produced\\nthree forms, a^{10}, f^{10}, and m^{10}, which, from having diverged in\\ncharacter during the successive generations, will have come to differ\\nlargely, but perhaps unequally, from each other and from their common\\nparent. If we suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in\\nour diagram to be excessively small, these three forms may still be only\\nwell-marked varieties; or they may have arrived at the doubtful category of\\nsub-species; but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of\\nmodification to be more numerous or greater in amount, to convert these\\nthree forms into well-defined species: thus the diagram illustrates the\\nsteps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties are increased\\ninto the larger differences distinguishing species. By continuing the same\\nprocess for a greater number of generations (as shown in the diagram in a\\ncondensed and simplified manner), we get eight species, marked by the\\nletters between a^{14} and m^{14}, all descended from (A). Thus, as I\\nbelieve, species are multiplied and genera are formed.\\n\\nIn a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary. In\\nthe diagram I have assumed that a second species (I) has produced, by\\nanalogous steps, after ten thousand generations, either two well-marked\\nvarieties (w^{10} and z^{10}) or two species, according to the amount of\\nchange supposed to be represented {121} between the horizontal lines. After\\nfourteen thousand generations, six new species, marked by the letters\\nn^{14} to z^{14}, are supposed to have been produced. In each genus, the\\nspecies, which are already extremely different in character, will generally\\ntend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants; for these will\\nhave the best chance of filling new and widely different places in the\\npolity of nature: hence in the diagram I have chosen the extreme species\\n(A), and the nearly extreme species (I), as those which have largely\\nvaried, and have given rise to new varieties and species. The other nine\\nspecies (marked by capital letters) of our original genus, may for a long\\nperiod continue to transmit unaltered descendants; and this is shown in the\\ndiagram by the dotted lines not prolonged far upwards from want of space.\\n\\nBut during the process of modification, represented in the diagram, another\\nof our principles, namely that of extinction, will have played an important\\npart. As in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily acts\\nby the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life over\\nother forms, there will be a constant tendency in the improved descendants\\nof any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent\\ntheir predecessors and their original parent. For it should be remembered\\nthat the competition will generally be most severe between those forms\\nwhich are most nearly related to each other in habits, constitution, and\\nstructure. Hence all the intermediate forms between the earlier and later\\nstates, that is between the less and more improved state of a species, as\\nwell as the original parent-species itself, will generally tend to become\\nextinct. So it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of\\ndescent, which will be conquered by later and improved lines of descent.\\nIf, however, the {122} modified offspring of a species get into some\\ndistinct country, or become quickly adapted to some quite new station, in\\nwhich child and parent do not come into competition, both may continue to\\nexist.\\n\\nIf then our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of\\nmodification, species (A) and all the earlier varieties will have become\\nextinct, having been replaced by eight new species (a^{14} to m^{14}); and\\n(I) will have been replaced by six (n^{14} to z^{14}) new species.\\n\\nBut we may go further than this. The original species of our genus were\\nsupposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally the\\ncase in nature; species (A) being more nearly related to B, C, and D, than\\nto the other species; and species (I) more to G, H, K, L, than to the\\nothers. These two species (A) and (I), were also supposed to be very common\\nand widely diffused species, so that they must originally have had some\\nadvantage over most of the other species of the genus. Their modified\\ndescendants, fourteen in number at the fourteen-thousandth generation, will\\nprobably have inherited some of the same advantages: they have also been\\nmodified and improved in a diversified manner at each stage of descent, so\\nas to have become adapted to many related places in the natural economy of\\ntheir country. It seems, therefore, to me extremely probable that they will\\nhave taken the places of, and thus exterminated, not only their parents (A)\\nand (I), but likewise some of the original species which were most nearly\\nrelated to their parents. Hence very few of the original species will have\\ntransmitted offspring to the fourteen-thousandth generation. We may suppose\\nthat only one (F), of the two species which were least closely related to\\nthe other nine original species, has transmitted descendants to this late\\nstage of descent. {123}\\n\\nThe new species in our diagram descended from the original eleven species,\\nwill now be fifteen in number. Owing to the divergent tendency of natural\\nselection, the extreme amount of difference in character between species\\na^{14} and z^{14} will be much greater than that between the most different\\nof the original eleven species. The new species, moreover, will be allied\\nto each other in a widely different manner. Of the eight descendants from\\n(A) the three marked a^{14}, q^{14}, p^{14}, will be nearly related from\\nhaving recently branched off from a^{10}; b^{14} and f^{14}, from having\\ndiverged at an earlier period from a^5, will be in some degree distinct\\nfrom the three first-named species; and lastly, o^{14}, e^{14} and m^{14},\\nwill be nearly related one to the other, but from having diverged at the\\nfirst commencement of the process of modification, will be widely different\\nfrom the other five species, and may constitute a sub-genus or even a\\ndistinct genus.\\n\\nThe six descendants from (I) will form two sub-genera or even genera. But\\nas the original species (I) differed largely from (A), standing nearly at\\nthe extreme points of the original genus, the six descendants from (I)\\nwill, owing to inheritance alone, differ considerably from the eight\\ndescendants from (A); the two groups, moreover, are supposed to have gone\\non diverging in different directions. The intermediate species, also (and\\nthis is a very important consideration), which connected the original\\nspecies (A) and (I), have all become, excepting (F), extinct, and have left\\nno descendants. Hence the six new species descended from (I), and the eight\\ndescended from (A), will have to be ranked as very distinct genera, or even\\nas distinct sub-families.\\n\\nThus it is, as I believe, that two or more genera are produced by descent\\nwith modification, from two or more species of the same genus. And the two\\nor {124} more parent-species are supposed to have descended from some one\\nspecies of an earlier genus. In our diagram, this is indicated by the\\nbroken lines, beneath the capital letters, converging in sub-branches\\ndownwards towards a single point; this point representing a single species,\\nthe supposed single parent of our several new sub-genera and genera.\\n\\nIt is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new\\nspecies F^{14}, which is supposed not to have diverged much in character,\\nbut to have retained the form of (F), either unaltered or altered only in a\\nslight degree. In this case, its affinities to the other fourteen new\\nspecies will be of a curious and circuitous nature. Having descended from a\\nform which stood between the two parent-species (A) and (I), now supposed\\nto be extinct and unknown, it will be in some degree intermediate in\\ncharacter between the two groups descended from these species. But as these\\ntwo groups have gone on diverging in character from the type of their\\nparents, the new species (F^{14}) will not be directly intermediate between\\nthem, but rather between types of the two groups; and every naturalist will\\nbe able to bring some such case before his mind.\\n\\nIn the diagram, each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to\\nrepresent a thousand generations, but each may represent a million or\\nhundred million generations, and likewise a section of the successive\\nstrata of the earth\\'s crust including extinct remains. We shall, when we\\ncome to our chapter on Geology, have to refer again to this subject, and I\\nthink we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the affinities of\\nextinct beings, which, though generally belonging to the same orders, or\\nfamilies, or genera, with those now living, yet are often, in some degree,\\nintermediate in character between existing groups; and we can understand\\nthis fact, for {125} the extinct species lived at very ancient epochs when\\nthe branching lines of descent had diverged less.\\n\\nI see no reason to limit the process of modification, as now explained, to\\nthe formation of genera alone. If, in our diagram, we suppose the amount of\\nchange represented by each successive group of diverging dotted lines to be\\nvery great, the forms marked a^{14} to p^{14}, those marked b^{14} and\\nf^{14}, and those marked o^{14} to m^{14}, will form three very distinct\\ngenera. We shall also have two very distinct genera descended from (I); and\\nas these latter two genera, both from continued divergence of character and\\nfrom inheritance from a different parent, will differ widely from the three\\ngenera descended from (A), the two little groups of genera will form two\\ndistinct families, or even orders, according to the amount of divergent\\nmodification supposed to be represented in the diagram. And the two new\\nfamilies, or orders, will have descended from two species of the original\\ngenus; and these two species are supposed to have descended from one\\nspecies of a still more ancient and unknown genus.\\n\\nWe have seen that in each country it is the species of the larger genera\\nwhich oftenest present varieties or incipient species. This, indeed, might\\nhave been expected; for as natural selection acts through one form having\\nsome advantage over other forms in the struggle for existence, it will\\nchiefly act on those which already have some advantage; and the largeness\\nof any group shows that its species have inherited from a common ancestor\\nsome advantage in common. Hence, the struggle for the production of new and\\nmodified descendants, will mainly lie between the larger groups, which are\\nall trying to increase in number. One large group will slowly conquer\\nanother large group, reduce its numbers, and thus lessen its chance of\\nfurther variation and improvement. Within the same large {126} group, the\\nlater and more highly perfected sub-groups, from branching out and seizing\\non many new places in the polity of Nature, will constantly tend to\\nsupplant and destroy the earlier and less improved sub-groups. Small and\\nbroken groups and sub-groups will finally disappear. Looking to the future,\\nwe can predict that the groups of organic beings which are now large and\\ntriumphant, and which are least broken up, that is, which as yet have\\nsuffered least extinction, will for a long period continue to increase. But\\nwhich groups will ultimately prevail, no man can predict; for we well know\\nthat many groups, formerly most extensively developed, have now become\\nextinct. Looking still more remotely to the future, we may predict that,\\nowing to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups, a\\nmultitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct, and leave no\\nmodified descendants; and consequently that of the species living at any\\none period, extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote futurity. I\\nshall have to return to this subject in the chapter on Classification, but\\nI may add that on this view of extremely few of the more ancient species\\nhaving transmitted descendants, and on the view of all the descendants of\\nthe same species making a class, we can understand how it is that there\\nexist but very few classes in each main division of the animal and\\nvegetable kingdoms. Although extremely few of the most ancient species may\\nnow have living and modified descendants, yet at the most remote geological\\nperiod, the earth may have been as well peopled with many species of many\\ngenera, families, orders, and classes, as at the present day.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Summary of Chapter._--If during the long course of ages and under varying\\nconditions of life, organic beings {127} vary at all in the several parts\\nof their organisation, and I think this cannot be disputed; if there be,\\nowing to the high geometrical ratio of increase of each species, a severe\\nstruggle for life at some age, season, or year, and this certainly cannot\\nbe disputed; then, considering the infinite complexity of the relations of\\nall organic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence,\\ncausing an infinite diversity in structure, constitution, and habits, to be\\nadvantageous to them, I think it would be a most extraordinary fact if no\\nvariation ever had occurred useful to each being\\'s own welfare, in the same\\nmanner as so many variations have occurred useful to man. But if variations\\nuseful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals thus\\ncharacterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle\\nfor life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to\\nproduce offspring similarly characterised. This principle of preservation,\\nI have called, for the sake of brevity, Natural Selection; and it leads to\\nthe improvement of each creature in relation to its organic and inorganic\\nconditions of life.\\n\\nNatural selection, on the principle of qualities being inherited at\\ncorresponding ages, can modify the egg, seed, or young, as easily as the\\nadult. Amongst many animals, sexual selection will give its aid to ordinary\\nselection, by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted males the\\ngreatest number of offspring. Sexual selection will also give characters\\nuseful to the males alone, in their struggles with other males.\\n\\nWhether natural selection has really thus acted in nature, in modifying and\\nadapting the various forms of life to their several conditions and\\nstations, must be judged of by the general tenour and balance of evidence\\ngiven in the following chapters. But we already see how it entails\\nextinction; and how largely extinction {128} has acted in the world\\'s\\nhistory, geology plainly declares. Natural selection, also, leads to\\ndivergence of character; for more living beings can be supported on the\\nsame area the more they diverge in structure, habits, and constitution, of\\nwhich we see proof by looking to the inhabitants of any small spot or to\\nnaturalised productions. Therefore during the modification of the\\ndescendants of any one species, and during the incessant struggle of all\\nspecies to increase in numbers, the more diversified these descendants\\nbecome, the better will be their chance of succeeding in the battle for\\nlife. Thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same\\nspecies, steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater\\ndifferences between species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera.\\n\\nWe have seen that it is the common, the widely-diffused, and widely-ranging\\nspecies, belonging to the larger genera, which vary most; and these tend to\\ntransmit to their modified offspring that superiority which now makes them\\ndominant in their own countries. Natural selection, as has just been\\nremarked, leads to divergence of character and to much extinction of the\\nless improved and intermediate forms of life. On these principles, I\\nbelieve, the nature of the affinities of all organic beings may be\\nexplained. It is a truly wonderful fact--the wonder of which we are apt to\\noverlook from familiarity--that all animals and all plants throughout all\\ntime and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to\\ngroup, in the manner which we everywhere behold--namely, varieties of the\\nsame species most closely related together, species of the same genus less\\nclosely and unequally related together, forming sections and sub-genera,\\nspecies of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in\\ndifferent degrees, forming {129} sub-families, families, orders,\\nsub-classes, and classes. The several subordinate groups in any class\\ncannot be ranked in a single file, but seem rather to be clustered round\\npoints, and these round other points, and so on in almost endless cycles.\\nOn the view that each species has been independently created, I can see no\\nexplanation of this great fact in the classification of all organic beings;\\nbut, to the best of my judgment, it is explained through inheritance and\\nthe complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and\\ndivergence of character, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram.\\n\\nThe affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been\\nrepresented by a great tree. I believe this simile largely speaks the\\ntruth. The green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and\\nthose produced during each former year may represent the long succession of\\nextinct species. At each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried\\nto branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs\\nand branches, in the same manner as species and groups of species have\\ntried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life. The limbs\\ndivided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches,\\nwere themselves once, when the tree was small, budding twigs; and this\\nconnexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well\\nrepresent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups\\nsubordinate to groups. Of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was\\na mere bush, only two or three, now grown into great branches, yet survive\\nand bear all the other branches; so with the species which lived during\\nlong-past geological periods, very few now have living and modified\\ndescendants. From the first growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has\\ndecayed and dropped off; and these lost branches of various {130} sizes may\\nrepresent those whole orders, families, and genera which have now no living\\nrepresentatives, and which are known to us only from having been found in a\\nfossil state. As we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing\\nfrom a fork low down in a tree, and which by some chance has been favoured\\nand is still alive on its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the\\nOrnithorhynchus or Lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by its\\naffinities two large branches of life, and which has apparently been saved\\nfrom fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station. As buds\\ngive rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and\\novertop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I believe it\\nhas been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with its dead and broken\\nbranches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever\\nbranching and beautiful ramifications.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{131}\\n\\nCHAPTER V.\\n\\nLAWS OF VARIATION.\\n\\n    Effects of external conditions--Use and disuse, combined with natural\\n    selection; organs of flight and of vision--Acclimatisation--Correlation\\n    of growth--Compensation and economy of growth--False\\n    correlations--Multiple, rudimentary, and lowly organised structures\\n    variable--Parts developed in an unusual manner are highly variable:\\n    specific characters more variable than generic: secondary sexual\\n    characters variable--Species of the same genus vary in an analogous\\n    manner--Reversions to long-lost characters--Summary.\\n\\nI have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations--so common and\\nmultiform in organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser degree in\\nthose in a state of nature--had been due to chance. This, of course, is a\\nwholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly our\\nignorance of the cause of each particular variation. Some authors believe\\nit to be as much the function of the reproductive system to produce\\nindividual differences, or very slight deviations of structure, as to make\\nthe child like its parents. But the much greater variability, as well as\\nthe greater frequency of monstrosities, under domestication or cultivation,\\nthan under nature, leads me to believe that deviations of structure are in\\nsome way due to the nature of the conditions of life, to which the parents\\nand their more remote ancestors have been exposed during several\\ngenerations. I have remarked in the first chapter--but a long catalogue of\\nfacts which cannot be here given would be necessary to show the truth of\\nthe remark--that the reproductive system is eminently susceptible to\\nchanges in the conditions of life; and to {132} this system being\\nfunctionally disturbed in the parents, I chiefly attribute the varying or\\nplastic condition of the offspring. The male and female sexual elements\\nseem to be affected before that union takes place which is to form a new\\nbeing. In the case of \"sporting\" plants, the bud, which in its earliest\\ncondition does not apparently differ essentially from an ovule, is alone\\naffected. But why, because the reproductive system is disturbed, this or\\nthat part should vary more or less, we are profoundly ignorant.\\nNevertheless, we can here and there dimly catch a faint ray of light, and\\nwe may feel sure that there must be some cause for each deviation of\\nstructure, however slight.\\n\\nHow much direct effect difference of climate, food, &c., produces on any\\nbeing is extremely doubtful. My impression is, that the effect is extremely\\nsmall in the case of animals, but perhaps rather more in that of plants. We\\nmay, at least, safely conclude that such influences cannot have produced\\nthe many striking and complex co-adaptations of structure between one\\norganic being and another, which we see everywhere throughout nature. Some\\nlittle influence may be attributed to climate, food, &c.: thus, E. Forbes\\nspeaks confidently that shells at their southern limit, and when living in\\nshallow water, are more brightly coloured than those of the same species\\nfurther north or from greater depths. Gould believes that birds of the same\\nspecies are more brightly coloured under a clear atmosphere, than when\\nliving on islands or near the coast. So with insects, Wollaston is\\nconvinced that residence near the sea affects their colours. Moquin-Tandon\\ngives a list of plants which when growing near the sea-shore have their\\nleaves in some degree fleshy, though not elsewhere fleshy. Several other\\nsuch cases could be given.\\n\\nThe fact of varieties of one species, when they range {133} into the zone\\nof habitation of other species, often acquiring in a very slight degree\\nsome of the characters of such species, accords with our view that species\\nof all kinds are only well-marked and permanent varieties. Thus the species\\nof shells which are confined to tropical and shallow seas are generally\\nbrighter-coloured than those confined to cold and deeper seas. The birds\\nwhich are confined to continents are, according to Mr. Gould,\\nbrighter-coloured than those of islands. The insect-species confined to\\nsea-coasts, as every collector knows, are often brassy or lurid. Plants\\nwhich live exclusively on the sea-side are very apt to have fleshy leaves.\\nHe who believes in the creation of each species, will have to say that this\\nshell, for instance, was created with bright colours for a warm sea; but\\nthat this other shell became bright-coloured by variation when it ranged\\ninto warmer or shallower waters.\\n\\nWhen a variation is of the slightest use to a being, we cannot tell how\\nmuch of it to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection,\\nand how much to the conditions of life. Thus, it is well known to furriers\\nthat animals of the same species have thicker and better fur the more\\nsevere the climate is under which they have lived; but who can tell how\\nmuch of this difference may be due to the warmest-clad individuals having\\nbeen favoured and preserved during many generations, and how much to the\\ndirect action of the severe climate? for it would appear that climate has\\nsome direct action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds.\\n\\nInstances could be given of the same variety being produced under\\nconditions of life as different as can well be conceived; and, on the other\\nhand, of different varieties being produced from the same species under the\\nsame conditions. Such facts show how indirectly {134} the conditions of\\nlife act. Again, innumerable instances are known to every naturalist of\\nspecies keeping true, or not varying at all, although living under the most\\nopposite climates. Such considerations as these incline me to lay very\\nlittle weight on the direct action of the conditions of life. Indirectly,\\nas already remarked, they seem to play an important part in affecting the\\nreproductive system, and in thus inducing variability; and natural\\nselection will then accumulate all profitable variations, however slight,\\nuntil they become plainly developed and appreciable by us.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Effects of Use and Disuse._--From the facts alluded to in the first\\nchapter, I think there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals\\nstrengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and\\nthat such modifications are inherited. Under free nature, we can have no\\nstandard of comparison, by which to judge of the effects of long-continued\\nuse or disuse, for we know not the parent-forms; but many animals have\\nstructures which can be explained by the effects of disuse. As Professor\\nOwen has remarked, there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that\\ncannot fly; yet there are several in this state. The logger-headed duck of\\nSouth America can only flap along the surface of the water, and has its\\nwings in nearly the same condition as the domestic Aylesbury duck. As the\\nlarger ground-feeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger, I\\nbelieve that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, which now\\ninhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no\\nbeast of prey, has been caused by disuse. The ostrich indeed inhabits\\ncontinents and is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by flight,\\nbut by kicking it can defend itself from enemies, as well as any of the\\nsmaller {135} quadrupeds. We may imagine that the early progenitor of the\\nostrich had habits like those of a bustard, and that as natural selection\\nincreased in successive generations the size and weight of its body, its\\nlegs were used more, and its wings less, until they became incapable of\\nflight.\\n\\nKirby has remarked (and I have observed the same fact) that the anterior\\ntarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are very often broken\\noff; he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection, and not one had\\neven a relic left. In the Onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually lost,\\nthat the insect has been described as not having them. In some other genera\\nthey are present, but in a rudimentary condition. In the Ateuchus or sacred\\nbeetle of the Egyptians, they are totally deficient. There is not\\nsufficient evidence to induce me to believe that mutilations are ever\\ninherited; and I should prefer explaining the entire absence of the\\nanterior tarsi in Ateuchus, and their rudimentary condition in some other\\ngenera, by the long-continued effects of disuse in their progenitors; for\\nas the tarsi are almost always lost in many dung-feeding beetles, they must\\nbe lost early in life, and therefore cannot be much used by these insects.\\n\\nIn some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of structure\\nwhich are wholly, or mainly, due to natural selection. Mr. Wollaston has\\ndiscovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out of the 550 species\\ninhabiting Madeira, are so far deficient in wings that they cannot fly; and\\nthat of the twenty-nine endemic genera, no less than twenty-three genera\\nhave all their species in this condition! Several facts, namely, that\\nbeetles in many parts of the world are frequently blown to sea and perish;\\nthat the beetles in Madeira, as observed by Mr. Wollaston, lie much\\nconcealed, {136} until the wind lulls and the sun shines; that the\\nproportion of wingless beetles is larger on the exposed Desertas than in\\nMadeira itself; and especially the extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted\\non by Mr. Wollaston, of the almost entire absence of certain large groups\\nof beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous, and which groups have habits of\\nlife almost necessitating frequent flight;--these several considerations\\nhave made me believe that the wingless condition of so many Madeira beetles\\nis mainly due to the action of natural selection, but combined probably\\nwith disuse. For during thousands of successive generations each individual\\nbeetle which flew least, either from its wings having been ever so little\\nless perfectly developed or from indolent habit, will have had the best\\nchance of surviving from not being blown out to sea; and, on the other\\nhand, those beetles which most readily took to flight would oftenest have\\nbeen blown to sea and thus have been destroyed.\\n\\nThe insects in Madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which, as the\\nflower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must habitually use their wings\\nto gain their subsistence, have, as Mr. Wollaston suspects, their wings not\\nat all reduced, but even enlarged. This is quite compatible with the action\\nof natural selection. For when a new insect first arrived on the island,\\nthe tendency of natural selection to enlarge or to reduce the wings, would\\ndepend on whether a greater number of individuals were saved by\\nsuccessfully battling with the winds, or by giving up the attempt and\\nrarely or never flying. As with mariners shipwrecked near a coast, it would\\nhave been better for the good swimmers if they had been able to swim still\\nfurther, whereas it would have been better for the bad swimmers if they had\\nnot been able to swim at all and had stuck to the wreck. {137}\\n\\nThe eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size,\\nand in some cases are quite covered up by skin and fur. This state of the\\neyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided perhaps by\\nnatural selection. In South America, a burrowing rodent, the tuco-tuco, or\\nCtenomys, is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole; and I was\\nassured by a Spaniard, who had often caught them, that they were frequently\\nblind; one which I kept alive was certainly in this condition, the cause,\\nas appeared on dissection, having been inflammation of the nictitating\\nmembrane. As frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any\\nanimal, and as eyes are certainly not indispensable to animals with\\nsubterranean habits, a reduction in their size with the adhesion of the\\neyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an advantage;\\nand if so, natural selection would constantly aid the effects of disuse.\\n\\nIt is well known that several animals, belonging to the most different\\nclasses, which inhabit the caves of Styria and of Kentucky, are blind. In\\nsome of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains, though the eye is\\ngone; the stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope with its\\nglasses has been lost. As it is difficult to imagine that eyes, though\\nuseless, could be in any way injurious to animals living in darkness, I\\nattribute their loss wholly to disuse. In one of the blind animals, namely,\\nthe cave-rat, the eyes are of immense size; and Professor Silliman thought\\nthat it regained, after living some days in the light, some slight power of\\nvision. In the same manner as in Madeira the wings of some of the insects\\nhave been enlarged, and the wings of others have been reduced by natural\\nselection aided by use and disuse, so in the case of the cave-rat natural\\nselection seems to have struggled with the loss of light and {138} to have\\nincreased the size of the eyes; whereas with all the other inhabitants of\\nthe caves, disuse by itself seems to have done its work.\\n\\nIt is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep\\nlimestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that on the common\\nview of the blind animals having been separately created for the American\\nand European caverns, close similarity in their organisation and affinities\\nmight have been expected; but, as SchiГ¶dte and others have remarked, this\\nis not the case, and the cave-insects of the two continents are not more\\nclosely allied than might have been anticipated from the general\\nresemblance of the other inhabitants of North America and Europe. On my\\nview we must suppose that American animals, having ordinary powers of\\nvision, slowly migrated by successive generations from the outer world into\\nthe deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky caves, as did European\\nanimals into the caves of Europe. We have some evidence of this gradation\\nof habit; for, as SchiГ¶dte remarks, \"animals not far remote from ordinary\\nforms, prepare the transition from light to darkness. Next follow those\\nthat are constructed for twilight; and, last of all, those destined for\\ntotal darkness.\" By the time that an animal had reached, after numberless\\ngenerations, the deepest recesses, disuse will on this view have more or\\nless perfectly obliterated its eyes, and natural selection will often have\\neffected other changes, such as an increase in the length of the antennГ¦ or\\npalpi, as a compensation for blindness. Notwithstanding such modifications,\\nwe might expect still to see in the cave-animals of America, affinities to\\nthe other inhabitants of that continent, and in those of Europe, to the\\ninhabitants of the European continent. And this is the case with some of\\nthe American cave-animals, as I hear from {139} Professor Dana; and some of\\nthe European cave-insects are very closely allied to those of the\\nsurrounding country. It would be most difficult to give any rational\\nexplanation of the affinities of the blind cave-animals to the other\\ninhabitants of the two continents on the ordinary view of their independent\\ncreation. That several of the inhabitants of the caves of the Old and New\\nWorlds should be closely related, we might expect from the well-known\\nrelationship of most of their other productions. Far from feeling any\\nsurprise that some of the cave-animals should be very anomalous, as Agassiz\\nhas remarked in regard to the blind fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the\\ncase with the blind Proteus with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am\\nonly surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved,\\nowing to the less severe competition to which the inhabitants of these dark\\nabodes will probably have been exposed.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Acclimatisation._--Habit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of\\nflowering, in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate, in the\\ntime of sleep, &c., and this leads me to say a few words on\\nacclimatisation. As it is extremely common for species of the same genus to\\ninhabit very hot and very cold countries, and as I believe that all the\\nspecies of the same genus have descended from a single parent, if this view\\nbe correct, acclimatisation must be readily effected during long-continued\\ndescent. It is notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its\\nown home: species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot\\nendure a tropical climate, or conversely. So again, many succulent plants\\ncannot endure a damp climate. But the degree of adaptation of species to\\nthe climates under which they live is often overrated. {140} We may infer\\nthis from our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported\\nplant will endure our climate, and from the number of plants and animals\\nbrought from warmer countries which here enjoy good health. We have reason\\nto believe that species in a state of nature are limited in their ranges by\\nthe competition of other organic beings quite as much as, or more than, by\\nadaptation to particular climates. But whether or not the adaptation be\\ngenerally very close, we have evidence, in the case of some few plants, of\\ntheir becoming, to a certain extent, naturally habituated to different\\ntemperatures, or becoming acclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons,\\nraised from seed collected by Dr. Hooker from trees growing at different\\nheights on the Himalaya, were found in this country to possess different\\nconstitutional powers of resisting cold. Mr. Thwaites informs me that he\\nhas observed similar facts in Ceylon, and analogous observations have been\\nmade by Mr. H. C. Watson on European species of plants brought from the\\nAzores to England. In regard to animals, several authentic cases could be\\ngiven of species within historical times having largely extended their\\nrange from warmer to cooler latitudes, and conversely; but we do not\\npositively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native\\nclimate, but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor do we\\nknow that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their new homes.\\n\\nAs I believe that our domestic animals were originally chosen by\\nuncivilised man because they were useful and bred readily under\\nconfinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable of\\nfar-extended transportation, I think the common and extraordinary capacity\\nin our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different\\nclimates but of being perfectly {141} fertile (a far severer test) under\\nthem, may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other animals,\\nnow in a state of nature, could easily be brought to bear widely different\\nclimates. We must not, however, push the foregoing argument too far, on\\naccount of the probable origin of some of our domestic animals from several\\nwild stocks: the blood, for instance, of a tropical and arctic wolf or wild\\ndog may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds. The rat and mouse cannot\\nbe considered as domestic animals, but they have been transported by man to\\nmany parts of the world, and now have a far wider range than any other\\nrodent, living free under the cold climate of Faroe in the north and of the\\nFalklands in the south, and on many islands in the torrid zones. Hence I am\\ninclined to look at adaptation to any special climate as a quality readily\\ngrafted on an innate wide flexibility of constitution, which is common to\\nmost animals. On this view, the capacity of enduring the most different\\nclimates by man himself and by his domestic animals, and such facts as that\\nformer species of the elephant and rhinoceros were capable of enduring a\\nglacial climate, whereas the living species are now all tropical or\\nsub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked at as anomalies, but\\nmerely as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution, brought,\\nunder peculiar circumstances, into play.\\n\\nHow much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is due\\nto mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of varieties having\\ndifferent innate constitutions, and how much to both means combined, is a\\nvery obscure question. That habit or custom has some influence I must\\nbelieve, both from analogy, and from the incessant advice given in\\nagricultural works, even in the ancient EncyclopГ¦dias of China, to be very\\n{142} cautious in transposing animals from one district to another; for it\\nis not likely that man should have succeeded in selecting so many breeds\\nand sub-breeds with constitutions specially fitted for their own districts:\\nthe result must, I think, be due to habit. On the other hand, I can see no\\nreason to doubt that natural selection will continually tend to preserve\\nthose individuals which are born with constitutions best adapted to their\\nnative countries. In treatises on many kinds of cultivated plants, certain\\nvarieties are said to withstand certain climates better than others: this\\nis very strikingly shown in works on fruit trees published in the United\\nStates, in which certain varieties are habitually recommended for the\\nnorthern, and others for the southern States; and as most of these\\nvarieties are of recent origin, they cannot owe their constitutional\\ndifferences to habit. The case of the Jerusalem artichoke, which is never\\npropagated by seed, and of which consequently new varieties have not been\\nproduced, has even been advanced--for it is now as tender as ever it\\nwas--as proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected! The case, also, of\\nthe kidney-bean has been often cited for a similar purpose, and with much\\ngreater weight; but until some one will sow, during a score of generations,\\nhis kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by\\nfrost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with care to prevent\\naccidental crosses, and then again get seed from these seedlings, with the\\nsame precautions, the experiment cannot be said to have been even tried.\\nNor let it be supposed that no differences in the constitution of seedling\\nkidney-beans ever appear, for an account has been published how much more\\nhardy some seedlings appeared to be than others.\\n\\nOn the whole, I think we may conclude that habit, {143} use, and disuse,\\nhave, in some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the\\nconstitution, and of the structure of various organs; but that the effects\\nof use and disuse have often been largely combined with, and sometimes\\novermastered by the natural selection of innate variations.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Correlation of Growth._--I mean by this expression that the whole\\norganisation is so tied together during its growth and development, that\\nwhen slight variations in any one part occur, and are accumulated through\\nnatural selection, other parts become modified. This is a very important\\nsubject, most imperfectly understood. The most obvious case is, that\\nmodifications accumulated solely for the good of the young or larva, will,\\nit may safely be concluded, affect the structure of the adult; in the same\\nmanner as any malconformation affecting the early embryo, seriously affects\\nthe whole organisation of the adult. The several parts of the body which\\nare homologous, and which, at an early embryonic period, are alike, seem\\nliable to vary in an allied manner: we see this in the right and left sides\\nof the body varying in the same manner; in the front and hind legs, and\\neven in the jaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed\\nto be homologous with the limbs. These tendencies, I do not doubt, may be\\nmastered more or less completely by natural selection: thus a family of\\nstags once existed with an antler only on one side; and if this had been of\\nany great use to the breed it might probably have been rendered permanent\\nby natural selection.\\n\\nHomologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to cohere;\\nthis is often seen in monstrous plants; and nothing is more common than the\\nunion of homologous parts in normal structures, as the union of {144} the\\npetals of the corolla into a tube. Hard parts seem to affect the form of\\nadjoining soft parts; it is believed by some authors that the diversity in\\nthe shape of the pelvis in birds causes the remarkable diversity in the\\nshape of their kidneys. Others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the\\nhuman mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the child. In\\nsnakes, according to Schlegel, the shape of the body and the manner of\\nswallowing determine the position of several of the most important viscera.\\n\\nThe nature of the bond of correlation is very frequently quite obscure. M.\\nIs. Geoffroy St. Hilaire has forcibly remarked, that certain\\nmalconformations very frequently, and that others rarely coexist, without\\nour being able to assign any reason. What can be more singular than the\\nrelation between blue eyes and deafness in cats, and the tortoise-shell\\ncolour with the female sex; the feathered feet and skin between the outer\\ntoes in pigeons, and the presence of more or less down on the young birds\\nwhen first hatched, with the future colour of their plumage; or, again, the\\nrelation between the hair and teeth in the naked Turkish dog, though here\\nprobably homology comes into play? With respect to this latter case of\\ncorrelation, I think it can hardly be accidental, that if we pick out the\\ntwo orders of mammalia which are most abnormal in their dermal covering,\\nviz. Cetacea (whales) and Edentata (armadilloes, scaly anteaters, &c.),\\nthat these are likewise the most abnormal in their teeth.\\n\\nI know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of\\ncorrelation in modifying important structures, independently of utility\\nand, therefore, of natural selection, than that of the difference between\\nthe outer and inner flowers in some Compositous and Umbelliferous plants.\\nEvery one knows the {145} difference in the ray and central florets of, for\\ninstance, the daisy, and this difference is often accompanied with the\\nabortion of parts of the flower. But, in some Compositous plants, the seeds\\nalso differ in shape and sculpture; and even the ovary itself, with its\\naccessory parts, differs, as has been described by Cassini. These\\ndifferences have been attributed by some authors to pressure, and the shape\\nof the seeds in the ray-florets in some CompositГ¦ countenances this idea;\\nbut, in the case of the corolla of the UmbelliferГ¦, it is by no means, as\\nDr. Hooker informs me, in species with the densest heads that the inner and\\nouter flowers most frequently differ. It might have been thought that the\\ndevelopment of the ray-petals by drawing nourishment from certain other\\nparts of the flower had caused their abortion; but in some CompositГ¦ there\\nis a difference in the seeds of the outer and inner florets without any\\ndifference in the corolla. Possibly, these several differences may be\\nconnected with some difference in the flow of nutriment towards the central\\nand external flowers: we know, at least, that in irregular flowers, those\\nnearest to the axis are oftenest subject to peloria, and become regular. I\\nmay add, as an instance of this, and of a striking case of correlation,\\nthat I have recently observed in some garden pelargoniums, that the central\\nflower of the truss often loses the patches of darker colour in the two\\nupper petals; and that when this occurs, the adherent nectary is quite\\naborted; when the colour is absent from only one of the two upper petals,\\nthe nectary is only much shortened.\\n\\nWith respect to the difference in the corolla of the central and exterior\\nflowers of a head or umbel, I do not feel at all sure that C. C. Sprengel\\'s\\nidea that the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly\\nadvantageous in the fertilisation of plants of {146} these two orders, is\\nso far-fetched, as it may at first appear: and if it be advantageous,\\nnatural selection may have come into play. But in regard to the differences\\nboth in the internal and external structure of the seeds, which are not\\nalways correlated with any differences in the flowers, it seems impossible\\nthat they can be in any way advantageous to the plant: yet in the\\nUmbelliferГ¦ these differences are of such apparent importance--the seeds\\nbeing in some cases, according to Tausch, orthospermous in the exterior\\nflowers and coelospermous in the central flowers,--that the elder De\\nCandolle founded his main divisions of the order on analogous differences.\\nHence we see that modifications of structure, viewed by systematists as of\\nhigh value, may be wholly due to unknown laws of correlated growth, and\\nwithout being, as far as we can see, of the slightest service to the\\nspecies.\\n\\nWe may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth, structures which\\nare common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are simply due to\\ninheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural\\nselection some one modification in structure, and, after thousands of\\ngenerations, some other and independent modification; and these two\\nmodifications, having been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with\\ndiverse habits, would naturally be thought to be correlated in some\\nnecessary manner. So, again, I do not doubt that some apparent\\ncorrelations, occurring throughout whole orders, are entirely due to the\\nmanner alone in which natural selection can act. For instance, Alph. De\\nCandolle has remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do\\nnot open: I should explain the rule by the fact that seeds could not\\ngradually become winged through natural selection, except in fruits which\\nopened; so that the individual plants producing {147} seeds which were a\\nlittle better fitted to be wafted further, might get an advantage over\\nthose producing seed less fitted for dispersal; and this process could not\\npossibly go on in fruit which did not open.\\n\\nThe elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded, at about the same period, their\\nlaw of compensation or balancement of growth; or, as Goethe expressed it,\\n\"in order to spend on one side, nature is forced to economise on the other\\nside.\" I think this holds true to a certain extent with our domestic\\nproductions: if nourishment flows to one part or organ in excess, it rarely\\nflows, at least in excess, to another part; thus it is difficult to get a\\ncow to give much milk and to fatten readily. The same varieties of the\\ncabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage and a copious supply\\nof oil-bearing seeds. When the seeds in our fruits become atrophied, the\\nfruit itself gains largely in size and quality. In our poultry, a large\\ntuft of feathers on the head is generally accompanied by a diminished comb,\\nand a large beard by diminished wattles. With species in a state of nature\\nit can hardly be maintained that the law is of universal application; but\\nmany good observers, more especially botanists, believe in its truth. I\\nwill not, however, here give any instances, for I see hardly any way of\\ndistinguishing between the effects, on the one hand, of a part being\\nlargely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining part\\nbeing reduced by this same process or by disuse, and, on the other hand,\\nthe actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of\\ngrowth in another and adjoining part.\\n\\nI suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have been\\nadvanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a more general\\nprinciple, namely, that natural selection is continually trying to\\neconomise in every part of the organisation. If under {148} changed\\nconditions of life a structure before useful becomes less useful, any\\ndiminution, however slight, in its development, will be seized on by\\nnatural selection, for it will profit the individual not to have its\\nnutriment wasted in building up an useless structure. I can thus only\\nunderstand a fact with which I was much struck when examining cirripedes,\\nand of which many other instances could be given: namely, that when a\\ncirripede is parasitic within another and is thus protected, it loses more\\nor less completely its own shell or carapace. This is the case with the\\nmale Ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner with the Proteolepas: for\\nthe carapace in all other cirripedes consists of the three highly-important\\nanterior segments of the head enormously developed, and furnished with\\ngreat nerves and muscles; but in the parasitic and protected Proteolepas,\\nthe whole anterior part of the head is reduced to the merest rudiment\\nattached to the bases of the prehensile antennГ¦. Now the saving of a large\\nand complex structure, when rendered superfluous by the parasitic habits of\\nthe Proteolepas, though effected by slow steps, would be a decided\\nadvantage to each successive individual of the species; for in the struggle\\nfor life to which every animal is exposed, each individual Proteolepas\\nwould have a better chance of supporting itself, by less nutriment being\\nwasted in developing a structure now become useless.\\n\\nThus, as I believe, natural selection will always succeed in the long run\\nin reducing and saving every part of the organisation, as soon as it is\\nrendered superfluous, without by any means causing some other part to be\\nlargely developed in a corresponding degree. And, conversely, that natural\\nselection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing any organ,\\nwithout requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of some\\nadjoining part. {149}\\n\\nIt seems to be a rule, as remarked by Is. Geoffroy St. Hilaire, both in\\nvarieties and in species, that when any part or organ is repeated many\\ntimes in the structure of the same individual (as the vertebrГ¦ in snakes,\\nand the stamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is variable; whereas the\\nnumber of the same part or organ, when it occurs in lesser numbers, is\\nconstant. The same author and some botanists have further remarked that\\nmultiple parts are also very liable to variation in structure. Inasmuch as\\nthis \"vegetative repetition,\" to use Prof. Owen\\'s expression, seems to be a\\nsign of low organisation, the foregoing remark seems connected with the\\nvery general opinion of naturalists, that beings low in the scale of nature\\nare more variable than those which are higher. I presume that lowness in\\nthis case means that the several parts of the organisation have been but\\nlittle specialised for particular functions; and as long as the same part\\nhas to perform diversified work, we can perhaps see why it should remain\\nvariable, that is, why natural selection should have preserved or rejected\\neach little deviation of form less carefully than when the part has to\\nserve for one special purpose alone. In the same way that a knife which has\\nto cut all sorts of things may be of almost any shape; whilst a tool for\\nsome particular object had better be of some particular shape. Natural\\nselection, it should never be forgotten, can act on each part of each\\nbeing, solely through and for its advantage.\\n\\nRudimentary parts, it has been stated by some authors, and I believe with\\ntruth, are apt to be highly variable. We shall have to recur to the general\\nsubject of rudimentary and aborted organs; and I will here only add that\\ntheir variability seems to be owing to their uselessness, and therefore to\\nnatural selection having no power to check deviations in their structure.\\nThus {150} rudimentary parts are left to the free play of the various laws\\nof growth, to the effects of long-continued disuse, and to the tendency to\\nreversion.\\n\\n\\n\\n_A part developed in any species in an extraordinary degree or manner, in\\ncomparison with the same part in allied species, tends to be highly\\nvariable._--Several years ago I was much struck with a remark, nearly to\\nthe above effect, published by Mr. Waterhouse. I infer also from an\\nobservation made by Professor Owen, with respect to the length of the arms\\nof the ourang-outang, that he has come to a nearly similar conclusion. It\\nis hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the truth of this proposition\\nwithout giving the long array of facts which I have collected, and which\\ncannot possibly be here introduced. I can only state my conviction that it\\nis a rule of high generality. I am aware of several causes of error, but I\\nhope that I have made due allowance for them. It should be understood that\\nthe rule by no means applies to any part, however unusually developed,\\nunless it be unusually developed in comparison with the same part in\\nclosely allied species. Thus, the bat\\'s wing is a most abnormal structure\\nin the class mammalia; but the rule would not here apply, because there is\\na whole group of bats having wings; it would apply only if some one species\\nof bat had its wings developed in some remarkable manner in comparison with\\nthe other species of the same genus. The rule applies very strongly in the\\ncase of secondary sexual characters, when displayed in any unusual manner.\\nThe term, secondary sexual characters, used by Hunter, applies to\\ncharacters which are attached to one sex, but are not directly connected\\nwith the act of reproduction. The rule applies to males and females; but as\\nfemales more rarely offer remarkable secondary sexual characters, it\\napplies {151} more rarely to them. The rule being so plainly applicable in\\nthe case of secondary sexual characters, may be due to the great\\nvariability of these characters, whether or not displayed in any unusual\\nmanner--of which fact I think there can be little doubt. But that our rule\\nis not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case\\nof hermaphrodite cirripedes; and I may here add, that I particularly\\nattended to Mr. Waterhouse\\'s remark, whilst investigating this Order, and I\\nam fully convinced that the rule almost invariably holds good with\\ncirripedes. I shall, in my future work, give a list of the more remarkable\\ncases; I will here only briefly give one, as it illustrates the rule in its\\nlargest application. The opercular valves of sessile cirripedes (rock\\nbarnacles) are, in every sense of the word, very important structures, and\\nthey differ extremely little even in different genera; but in the several\\nspecies of one genus, Pyrgoma, these valves present a marvellous amount of\\ndiversification: the homologous valves in the different species being\\nsometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in the\\nindividuals of several of the species is so great, that it is no\\nexaggeration to state that the varieties differ more from each other in the\\ncharacters of these important valves than do other species of distinct\\ngenera.\\n\\nAs birds within the same country vary in a remarkably small degree, I have\\nparticularly attended to them, and the rule seems to me certainly to hold\\ngood in this class. I cannot make out that it applies to plants, and this\\nwould seriously have shaken my belief in its truth, had not the great\\nvariability in plants made it particularly difficult to compare their\\nrelative degrees of variability.\\n\\nWhen we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner in\\nany species, the fair {152} presumption is that it is of high importance to\\nthat species; nevertheless the part in this case is eminently liable to\\nvariation. Why should this be so? On the view that each species has been\\nindependently created, with all its parts as we now see them, I can see no\\nexplanation. But on the view that groups of species have descended from\\nother species, and have been modified through natural selection, I think we\\ncan obtain some light. In our domestic animals, if any part, or the whole\\nanimal, be neglected and no selection be applied, that part (for instance,\\nthe comb in the Dorking fowl) or the whole breed will cease to have a\\nnearly uniform character. The breed will then be said to have degenerated.\\nIn rudimentary organs, and in those which have been but little specialised\\nfor any particular purpose, and perhaps in polymorphic groups, we see a\\nnearly parallel natural case; for in such cases natural selection either\\nhas not or cannot come into full play, and thus the organisation is left in\\na fluctuating condition. But what here more especially concerns us is, that\\nin our domestic animals those points, which at the present time are\\nundergoing rapid change by continued selection, are also eminently liable\\nto variation. Look at the breeds of the pigeon; see what a prodigious\\namount of difference there is in the beak of the different tumblers, in the\\nbeak and wattle of the different carriers, in the carriage and tail of our\\nfantails, &c., these being the points now mainly attended to by English\\nfanciers. Even in the sub-breeds, as in the short-faced tumbler, it is\\nnotoriously difficult to breed them nearly to perfection, and frequently\\nindividuals are born which depart widely from the standard. There may be\\ntruly said to be a constant struggle going on between, on the one hand, the\\ntendency to reversion to a less modified state, as well as an innate\\ntendency to further {153} variability of all kinds, and, on the other hand,\\nthe power of steady selection to keep the breed true. In the long run\\nselection gains the day, and we do not expect to fail so far as to breed a\\nbird as coarse as a common tumbler from a good short-faced strain. But as\\nlong as selection is rapidly going on, there may always be expected to be\\nmuch variability in the structure undergoing modification. It further\\ndeserves notice that these variable characters, produced by man\\'s\\nselection, sometimes become attached, from causes quite unknown to us, more\\nto one sex than to the other, generally to the male sex, as with the wattle\\nof carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters.\\n\\nNow let us turn to nature. When a part has been developed in an\\nextraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other species of\\nthe same genus, we may conclude that this part has undergone an\\nextraordinary amount of modification since the period when the species\\nbranched off from the common progenitor of the genus. This period will\\nseldom be remote in any extreme degree, as species very rarely endure for\\nmore than one geological period. An extraordinary amount of modification\\nimplies an unusually large and long-continued amount of variability, which\\nhas continually been accumulated by natural selection for the benefit of\\nthe species. But as the variability of the extraordinarily-developed part\\nor organ has been so great and long-continued within a period not\\nexcessively remote, we might, as a general rule, expect still to find more\\nvariability in such parts than in other parts of the organisation which\\nhave remained for a much longer period nearly constant. And this, I am\\nconvinced, is the case. That the struggle between natural selection on the\\none hand, and the tendency to reversion and variability on the other hand,\\nwill in the {154} course of time cease; and that the most abnormally\\ndeveloped organs may be made constant, I can see no reason to doubt. Hence\\nwhen an organ, however abnormal it may be, has been transmitted in\\napproximately the same condition to many modified descendants, as in the\\ncase of the wing of the bat, it must have existed, according to my theory,\\nfor an immense period in nearly the same state; and thus it comes to be no\\nmore variable than any other structure. It is only in those cases in which\\nthe modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great\\nthat we ought to find the _generative variability_, as it may be called,\\nstill present in a high degree. For in this case the variability will\\nseldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the individuals\\nvarying in the required manner and degree, and by the continued rejection\\nof those tending to revert to a former and less modified condition.\\n\\nThe principle included in these remarks may be extended. It is notorious\\nthat specific characters are more variable than generic. To explain by a\\nsimple example what is meant. If some species in a large genus of plants\\nhad blue flowers and some had red, the colour would be only a specific\\ncharacter, and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species varying\\ninto red, or conversely; but if all the species had blue flowers, the\\ncolour would become a generic character, and its variation would be a more\\nunusual circumstance. I have chosen this example because an explanation is\\nnot in this case applicable, which most naturalists would advance, namely,\\nthat specific characters are more variable than generic, because they are\\ntaken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly used\\nfor classing genera. I believe this explanation is partly, yet only\\nindirectly, true; I shall, however, have to {155} return to this subject in\\nour chapter on Classification. It would be almost superfluous to adduce\\nevidence in support of the above statement, that specific characters are\\nmore variable than generic; but I have repeatedly noticed in works on\\nnatural history, that when an author has remarked with surprise that some\\n_important_ organ or part, which is generally very constant throughout\\nlarge groups of species, has _differed_ considerably in closely-allied\\nspecies, that it has, also, been _variable_ in the individuals of some of\\nthe species. And this fact shows that a character, which is generally of\\ngeneric value, when it sinks in value and becomes only of specific value,\\noften becomes variable, though its physiological importance may remain the\\nsame. Something of the same kind applies to monstrosities: at least Is.\\nGeoffroy St. Hilaire seems to entertain no doubt, that the more an organ\\nnormally differs in the different species of the same group, the more\\nsubject it is to individual anomalies.\\n\\nOn the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, why\\nshould that part of the structure, which differs from the same part in\\nother independently-created species of the same genus, be more variable\\nthan those parts which are closely alike in the several species? I do not\\nsee that any explanation can be given. But on the view of species being\\nonly strongly marked and fixed varieties, we might surely expect to find\\nthem still often continuing to vary in those parts of their structure which\\nhave varied within a moderately recent period, and which have thus come to\\ndiffer. Or to state the case in another manner:--the points in which all\\nthe species of a genus resemble each other, and in which they differ from\\nthe species of some other genus, are called generic characters; and these\\ncharacters in common I attribute to {156} inheritance from a common\\nprogenitor, for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will\\nhave modified several species, fitted to more or less widely-different\\nhabits, in exactly the same manner: and as these so-called generic\\ncharacters have been inherited from a remote period, since that period when\\nthe species first branched off from their common progenitor, and\\nsubsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree, or only in a\\nslight degree, it is not probable that they should vary at the present day.\\nOn the other hand, the points in which species differ from other species of\\nthe same genus, are called specific characters; and as these specific\\ncharacters have varied and come to differ within the period of the\\nbranching off of the species from a common progenitor, it is probable that\\nthey should still often be in some degree variable,--at least more variable\\nthan those parts of the organisation which have for a very long period\\nremained constant.\\n\\nIn connexion with the present subject, I will make only two other remarks.\\nI think it will be admitted, without my entering on details, that secondary\\nsexual characters are very variable; I think it also will be admitted that\\nspecies of the same group differ from each other more widely in their\\nsecondary sexual characters, than in other parts of their organisation;\\ncompare, for instance, the amount of difference between the males of\\ngallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual characters are strongly\\ndisplayed, with the amount of difference between their females; and the\\ntruth of this proposition will be granted. The cause of the original\\nvariability of secondary sexual characters is not manifest; but we can see\\nwhy these characters should not have been rendered as constant and uniform\\nas other parts of the organisation; for secondary sexual characters have\\nbeen accumulated by sexual selection, which {157} is less rigid in its\\naction than ordinary selection, as it does not entail death, but only gives\\nfewer offspring to the less favoured males. Whatever the cause may be of\\nthe variability of secondary sexual characters, as they are highly\\nvariable, sexual selection will have had a wide scope for action, and may\\nthus readily have succeeded in giving to the species of the same group a\\ngreater amount of difference in their sexual characters, than in other\\nparts of their structure.\\n\\nIt is a remarkable fact, that the secondary sexual differences between the\\ntwo sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very same\\nparts of the organisation in which the different species of the same genus\\ndiffer from each other. Of this fact I will give in illustration two\\ninstances, the first which happen to stand on my list; and as the\\ndifferences in these cases are of a very unusual nature, the relation can\\nhardly be accidental. The same number of joints in the tarsi is a character\\ngenerally common to very large groups of beetles, but in the EngidГ¦, as\\nWestwood has remarked, the number varies greatly; and the number likewise\\ndiffers in the two sexes of the same species: again in fossorial\\nhymenoptera, the manner of neuration of the wings is a character of the\\nhighest importance, because common to large groups; but in certain genera\\nthe neuration differs in the different species, and likewise in the two\\nsexes of the same species. This relation has a clear meaning on my view of\\nthe subject: I look at all the species of the same genus as having as\\ncertainly descended from the same progenitor, as have the two sexes of any\\none of the species. Consequently, whatever part of the structure of the\\ncommon progenitor, or of its early descendants, became variable; variations\\nof this part would, it is highly probable, be taken advantage of by natural\\nand sexual selection, in order to fit {158} the several species to their\\nseveral places in the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the two sexes\\nof the same species to each other, or to fit the males and females to\\ndifferent habits of life, or the males to struggle with other males for the\\npossession of the females.\\n\\nFinally, then, I conclude that the greater variability of specific\\ncharacters, or those which distinguish species from species, than of\\ngeneric characters, or those which the species possess in common;--that the\\nfrequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in a species in\\nan extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part in its congeners;\\nand the slight degree of variability in a part, however extraordinarily it\\nmay be developed, if it be common to a whole group of species;--that the\\ngreat variability of secondary sexual characters, and the great amount of\\ndifference in these same characters between closely allied species;--that\\nsecondary sexual and ordinary specific differences are generally displayed\\nin the same parts of the organisation,--are all principles closely\\nconnected together. All being mainly due to the species of the same group\\nhaving descended from a common progenitor, from whom they have inherited\\nmuch in common,--to parts which have recently and largely varied being more\\nlikely still to go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and\\nhave not varied,--to natural selection having more or less completely,\\naccording to the lapse of time, overmastered the tendency to reversion and\\nto further variability,--to sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary\\nselection,--and to variations in the same parts having been accumulated by\\nnatural and sexual selection, and having been thus adapted for secondary\\nsexual, and for ordinary specific purposes. {159}\\n\\n\\n\\n_Distinct species present analogous variations; and a variety of one\\nspecies often assumes some of the characters of an allied species, or\\nreverts to some of the characters of an early progenitor._--These\\npropositions will be most readily understood by looking to our domestic\\nraces. The most distinct breeds of pigeons, in countries most widely apart,\\npresent sub-varieties with reversed feathers on the head and feathers on\\nthe feet,--characters not possessed by the aboriginal rock-pigeon; these\\nthen are analogous variations in two or more distinct races. The frequent\\npresence of fourteen or even sixteen tail-feathers in the pouter, may be\\nconsidered as a variation representing the normal structure of another\\nrace, the fantail. I presume that no one will doubt that all such analogous\\nvariations are due to the several races of the pigeon having inherited from\\na common parent the same constitution and tendency to variation, when acted\\non by similar unknown influences. In the vegetable kingdom we have a case\\nof analogous variation, in the enlarged stems, or roots as commonly called,\\nof the Swedish turnip and Ruta baga, plants which several botanists tank as\\nvarieties produced by cultivation from a common parent: if this be not so,\\nthe case will then be one of analogous variation in two so-called distinct\\nspecies; and to these a third may be added, namely, the common turnip.\\nAccording to the ordinary view of each species having been independently\\ncreated, we should have to attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems\\nof these three plants, not to the _vera causa_ of community of descent, and\\na consequent tendency to vary in a like manner, but to three separate yet\\nclosely related acts of creation.\\n\\nWith pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the occasional\\nappearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with two black bars on\\nthe wings, a white {160} rump, a bar at the end of the tail, with the outer\\nfeathers externally edged near their bases with white. As all these marks\\nare characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon, I presume that no one will\\ndoubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet analogous\\nvariation appearing in the several breeds. We may I think confidently come\\nto this conclusion, because, as we have seen, these coloured marks are\\neminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct and\\ndifferently coloured breeds; and in this case there is nothing in the\\nexternal conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the slaty-blue,\\nwith the several marks, beyond the influence of the mere act of crossing on\\nthe laws of inheritance.\\n\\nNo doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear after\\nhaving been lost for many, perhaps for hundreds of generations. But when a\\nbreed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the offspring\\noccasionally show a tendency to revert in character to the foreign breed\\nfor many generations--some say, for a dozen or even a score of generations.\\nAfter twelve generations, the proportion of blood, to use a common\\nexpression, of any one ancestor, is only 1 in 2048; and yet, as we see, it\\nis generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained by this very\\nsmall proportion of foreign blood. In a breed which has not been crossed,\\nbut in which _both_ parents have lost some character which their progenitor\\npossessed, the tendency, whether strong or weak, to reproduce the lost\\ncharacter might be, as was formerly remarked, for all that we can see to\\nthe contrary, transmitted for almost any number of generations. When a\\ncharacter which has been lost in a breed, reappears after a great number of\\ngenerations, the most probable hypothesis is, not that the offspring\\nsuddenly takes after an ancestor some hundred generations {161} distant,\\nbut that in each successive generation there has been a tendency to\\nreproduce the character in question, which at last, under unknown\\nfavourable conditions, gains an ascendancy. For instance, it is probable\\nthat in each generation of the barb-pigeon, which produces most rarely a\\nblue and black-barred bird, there has been a tendency in each generation in\\nthe plumage to assume this colour. This view is hypothetical, but could be\\nsupported by some facts; and I can see no more abstract improbability in a\\ntendency to produce any character being inherited for an endless number of\\ngenerations, than in quite useless or rudimentary organs being, as we all\\nknow them to be, thus inherited. Indeed, we may sometimes observe a mere\\ntendency to produce a rudiment inherited: for instance, in the common\\nsnapdragon (Antirrhinum) a rudiment of a fifth stamen so often appears,\\nthat this plant must have an inherited tendency to produce it.\\n\\nAs all the species of the same genus are supposed, on my theory, to have\\ndescended from a common parent, it might be expected that they would\\noccasionally vary in an analogous manner; so that a variety of one species\\nwould resemble in some of its characters another species; this other\\nspecies being on my view only a well-marked and permanent variety. But\\ncharacters thus gained would probably be of an unimportant nature, for the\\npresence of all important characters will be governed by natural selection,\\nin accordance with the diverse habits of the species, and will not be left\\nto the mutual action of the conditions of life and of a similar inherited\\nconstitution. It might further be expected that the species of the same\\ngenus would occasionally exhibit reversions to lost ancestral characters.\\nAs, however, we never know the exact character of the common ancestor of a\\ngroup, we could not distinguish these two {162} cases: if, for instance, we\\ndid not know that the rock-pigeon was not feather-footed or turn-crowned,\\nwe could not have told, whether these characters in our domestic breeds\\nwere reversions or only analogous variations; but we might have inferred\\nthat the blueness was a case of reversion, from the number of the markings,\\nwhich are correlated with the blue tint, and which it does not appear\\nprobable would all appear together from simple variation. More especially\\nwe might have inferred this, from the blue colour and marks so often\\nappearing when distinct breeds of diverse colours are crossed. Hence,\\nthough under nature it must generally be left doubtful, what cases are\\nreversions to an anciently existing character, and what are new but\\nanalogous variations, yet we ought, on my theory, sometimes to find the\\nvarying offspring of a species assuming characters (either from reversion\\nor from analogous variation) which already occur in some other members of\\nthe same group. And this undoubtedly is the case in nature.\\n\\nA considerable part of the difficulty in recognising a variable species in\\nour systematic works, is due to its varieties mocking, as it were, some of\\nthe other species of the same genus. A considerable catalogue, also, could\\nbe given of forms intermediate between two other forms, which themselves\\nmust be doubtfully ranked as either varieties or species; and this shows,\\nunless all these forms be considered as independently created species, that\\nthe one in varying has assumed some of the characters of the other, so as\\nto produce the intermediate form. But the best evidence is afforded by\\nparts or organs of an important and uniform nature occasionally varying so\\nas to acquire, in some degree, the character of the same part or organ in\\nan allied species. I have collected a long list of such cases; but {163}\\nhere, as before, I lie under a great disadvantage in not being able to give\\nthem. I can only repeat that such cases certainly do occur, and seem to me\\nvery remarkable.\\n\\nI will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as affecting\\nany important character, but from occurring in several species of the same\\ngenus, partly under domestication and partly under nature. It is a case\\napparently of reversion. The ass not rarely has very distinct transverse\\nbars on its legs, like those on the legs of the zebra: it has been asserted\\nthat these are plainest in the foal, and from inquiries which I have made,\\nI believe this to be true. It has also been asserted that the stripe on\\neach shoulder is sometimes double. The shoulder-stripe is certainly very\\nvariable in length and outline. A white ass, but _not_ an albino, has been\\ndescribed without either spinal or shoulder stripe; and these stripes are\\nsometimes very obscure, or actually quite lost, in dark-coloured asses. The\\nkoulan of Pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulder-stripe.\\nThe hemionus has no shoulder-stripe; but traces of it, as stated by Mr.\\nBlyth and others, occasionally appear: and I have been informed by Colonel\\nPoole that the foals of this species are generally striped on the legs, and\\nfaintly on the shoulder. The quagga, though so plainly barred like a zebra\\nover the body, is without bars on the legs; but Dr. Gray has figured one\\nspecimen with very distinct zebra-like bars on the hocks.\\n\\nWith respect to the horse, I have collected cases in England of the spinal\\nstripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of _all_ colours;\\ntransverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns, mouse-duns, and in one\\ninstance in a chestnut: a faint shoulder-stripe may sometimes be seen in\\nduns, and I have seen a trace in a {164} bay horse. My son made a careful\\nexamination and sketch for me of a dun Belgian cart-horse with a double\\nstripe on each shoulder and with leg-stripes; and a man, whom I can\\nimplicitly trust, has examined for me a small dun Welch pony with _three_\\nshort parallel stripes on each shoulder.\\n\\nIn the north-west part of India the Kattywar breed of horses is so\\ngenerally striped, that, as I hear from Colonel Poole, who examined the\\nbreed for the Indian Government, a horse without stripes is not considered\\nas purely-bred. The spine is always striped; the legs are generally barred;\\nand the shoulder-stripe, which is sometimes double and sometimes treble, is\\ncommon; the side of the face, moreover, is sometimes striped. The stripes\\nare plainest in the foal; and sometimes quite disappear in old horses.\\nColonel Poole has seen both gray and bay Kattywar horses striped when first\\nfoaled. I have, also, reason to suspect, from information given me by Mr.\\nW. W. Edwards, that with the English racehorse the spinal stripe is much\\ncommoner in the foal than in the full-grown animal. Without here entering\\non further details, I may state that I have collected cases of leg and\\nshoulder stripes in horses of very different breeds, in various countries\\nfrom Britain to Eastern China; and from Norway in the north to the Malay\\nArchipelago in the south. In all parts of the world these stripes occur far\\noftenest in duns and mouse-duns; by the term dun a large range of colour is\\nincluded, from one between brown and black to a close approach to\\ncream-colour.\\n\\nI am aware that Colonel Hamilton Smith, who has written on this subject,\\nbelieves that the several breeds of the horse have descended from several\\naboriginal species--one of which, the dun, was striped; and that the\\nabove-described appearances are all due to ancient {165} crosses with the\\ndun stock. But I am not at all satisfied with this theory, and should be\\nloth to apply it to breeds so distinct as the heavy Belgian cart-horse,\\nWelch ponies, cobs, the lanky Kattywar race, &c., inhabiting the most\\ndistant parts of the world.\\n\\nNow let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the\\nhorse-genus. Rollin asserts, that the common mule from the ass and horse is\\nparticularly apt to have bars on its legs: according to Mr. Gosse, in\\ncertain parts of the United States about nine out of ten mules have striped\\nlegs. I once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any one would at\\nfirst have thought that it must have been the product of a zebra; and Mr.\\nW. C. Martin, in his excellent treatise on the horse, has given a figure of\\na similar mule. In four coloured drawings, which I have seen, of hybrids\\nbetween the ass and zebra, the legs were much more plainly barred than the\\nrest of the body; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe. In\\nLord Morton\\'s famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the\\nhybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by\\na black Arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is\\neven the pure quagga. Lastly, and this is another most remarkable case, a\\nhybrid has been figured by Dr. Gray (and he informs me that he knows of a\\nsecond case) from the ass and the hemionus; and this hybrid, though the ass\\nseldom has stripes on his legs and the hemionus has none and has not even a\\nshoulder-stripe, nevertheless had all four legs barred, and had three short\\nshoulder-stripes, like those on the dun Welch pony, and even had some\\nzebra-like stripes on the sides of its face. With respect to this last\\nfact, I was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears from what\\nwould commonly be called an {166} accident, that I was led solely from the\\noccurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the ass and hemionus to\\nask Colonel Poole whether such face-stripes ever occur in the eminently\\nstriped Kattywar breed of horses, and was, as we have seen, answered in the\\naffirmative.\\n\\nWhat now are we to say to these several facts? We see several very distinct\\nspecies of the horse-genus becoming, by simple variation, striped on the\\nlegs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like an ass. In the horse we\\nsee this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appears--a tint which\\napproaches to that of the general colouring of the other species of the\\ngenus. The appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change of\\nform or by any other new character. We see this tendency to become striped\\nmost strongly displayed in hybrids from between several of the most\\ndistinct species. Now observe the case of the several breeds of pigeons:\\nthey are descended from a pigeon (including two or three sub-species or\\ngeographical races) of a bluish colour, with certain bars and other marks;\\nand when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish tint, these bars\\nand other marks invariably reappear; but without any other change of form\\nor character. When the oldest and truest breeds of various colours are\\ncrossed, we see a strong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to\\nreappear in the mongrels. I have stated that the most probable hypothesis\\nto account for the reappearance of very ancient characters, is--that there\\nis a _tendency_ in the young of each successive generation to produce the\\nlong-lost character, and that this tendency, from unknown causes, sometimes\\nprevails. And we have just seen that in several species of the horse-genus\\nthe stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly in the young than in\\nthe old. Call the breeds of pigeons, some of which have bred true for {167}\\ncenturies, species; and how exactly parallel is the case with that of the\\nspecies of the horse-genus! For myself, I venture confidently to look back\\nthousands on thousands of generations, and I see an animal striped like a\\nzebra, but perhaps otherwise very differently constructed, the common\\nparent of our domestic horse, whether or not it be descended from one or\\nmore wild stocks, of the ass, the hemionus, quagga, and zebra.\\n\\nHe who believes that each equine species was independently created, will, I\\npresume, assert that each species has been created with a tendency to vary,\\nboth under nature and under domestication, in this particular manner, so as\\noften to become striped like other species of the genus; and that each has\\nbeen created with a strong tendency, when crossed with species inhabiting\\ndistant quarters of the world, to produce hybrids resembling in their\\nstripes, not their own parents, but other species of the genus. To admit\\nthis view is, as it seems to me, to reject a real for an unreal, or at\\nleast for an unknown, cause. It makes the works of God a mere mockery and\\ndeception; I would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant\\ncosmogonists, that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created in\\nstone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Summary._--Our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. Not in one\\ncase out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that\\npart differs, more or less, from the same part in the parents. But whenever\\nwe have the means of instituting a comparison, the same laws appear to have\\nacted in producing the lesser differences between varieties of the same\\nspecies, and the greater differences between species of the same genus. The\\nexternal conditions of life, as {168} climate and food, &c., seem to have\\ninduced some slight modifications. Habit in producing constitutional\\ndifferences, and use in strengthening and disuse in weakening and\\ndiminishing organs, seem to have been more potent in their effects.\\nHomologous parts tend to vary in the same way, and homologous parts tend to\\ncohere. Modifications in hard parts and in external parts sometimes affect\\nsofter and internal parts. When one part is largely developed, perhaps it\\ntends to draw nourishment from the adjoining parts; and every part of the\\nstructure which can be saved without detriment to the individual, will be\\nsaved. Changes of structure at an early age will generally affect parts\\nsubsequently developed; and there are very many other correlations of\\ngrowth, the nature of which we are utterly unable to understand. Multiple\\nparts are variable in number and in structure, perhaps arising from such\\nparts not having been closely specialised to any particular function, so\\nthat their modifications have not been closely checked by natural\\nselection. It is probably from this same cause that organic beings low in\\nthe scale of nature are more variable than those which have their whole\\norganisation more specialised, and are higher in the scale. Rudimentary\\norgans, from being useless, will be disregarded by natural selection, and\\nhence probably are variable. Specific characters--that is, the characters\\nwhich have come to differ since the several species of the same genus\\nbranched off from a common parent--are more variable than generic\\ncharacters, or those which have long been inherited, and have not differed\\nwithin this same period. In these remarks we have referred to special parts\\nor organs being still variable, because they have recently varied and thus\\ncome to differ; but we have also seen in the second Chapter that the same\\nprinciple applies to the whole individual; {169} for in a district where\\nmany species of any genus are found--that is, where there has been much\\nformer variation and differentiation, or where the manufactory of new\\nspecific forms has been actively at work--there, on an average, we now find\\nmost varieties or incipient species. Secondary sexual characters are highly\\nvariable, and such characters differ much in the species of the same group.\\nVariability in the same parts of the organisation has generally been taken\\nadvantage of in giving secondary sexual differences to the sexes of the\\nsame species, and specific differences to the several species of the same\\ngenus. Any part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an\\nextraordinary manner, in comparison with the same part or organ in the\\nallied species, must have gone through an extraordinary amount of\\nmodification since the genus arose; and thus we can understand why it\\nshould often still be variable in a much higher degree than other parts;\\nfor variation is a long-continued and slow process, and natural selection\\nwill in such cases not as yet have had time to overcome the tendency to\\nfurther variability and to reversion to a less modified state. But when a\\nspecies with any extraordinarily-developed organ has become the parent of\\nmany modified descendants--which on my view must be a very slow process,\\nrequiring a long lapse of time--in this case, natural selection may readily\\nhave succeeded in giving a fixed character to the organ, in however\\nextraordinary a manner it may be developed. Species inheriting nearly the\\nsame constitution from a common parent and exposed to similar influences\\nwill naturally tend to present analogous variations, and these same species\\nmay occasionally revert to some of the characters of their ancient\\nprogenitors. Although new and important modifications may not arise from\\nreversion and analogous {170} variation, such modifications will add to the\\nbeautiful and harmonious diversity of nature.\\n\\nWhatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from\\ntheir parents--and a cause for each must exist--it is the steady\\naccumulation, through natural selection, of such differences, when\\nbeneficial to the individual, that gives rise to all the more important\\nmodifications of structure, by which the innumerable beings on the face of\\nthis earth are enabled to struggle with each other, and the best adapted to\\nsurvive.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{171}\\n\\nCHAPTER VI.\\n\\nDIFFICULTIES ON THEORY.\\n\\n    Difficulties on the theory of descent with\\n    modification--Transitions--Absence or rarity of transitional\\n    varieties--Transitions in habits of life--Diversified habits in the\\n    same species--Species with habits widely different from those of their\\n    allies--Organs of extreme perfection--Means of transition--Cases of\\n    difficulty--Natura non facit saltum--Organs of small importance--Organs\\n    not in all cases absolutely perfect--The law of Unity of Type and of\\n    the Conditions of Existence embraced by the theory of Natural\\n    Selection.\\n\\nLong before having arrived at this part of my work, a crowd of difficulties\\nwill have occurred to the reader. Some of them are so grave that to this\\nday I can never reflect on them without being staggered; but, to the best\\nof my judgment, the greater number are only apparent, and those that are\\nreal are not, I think, fatal to my theory.\\n\\nThese difficulties and objections may be classed under the following\\nheads:--Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by\\ninsensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable\\ntransitional forms? Why is not all nature in confusion instead of the\\nspecies being, as we see them, well defined?\\n\\nSecondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the structure\\nand habits of a bat, could have been formed by the modification of some\\nanimal with wholly different habits? Can we believe that natural selection\\ncould produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as the\\ntail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand,\\norgans of {172} such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as\\nyet fully understand the inimitable perfection?\\n\\nThirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural selection?\\nWhat shall we say to so marvellous an instinct as that which leads the bee\\nto make cells, which has practically anticipated the discoveries of\\nprofound mathematicians?\\n\\nFourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed, being sterile and\\nproducing sterile offspring, whereas, when varieties are crossed, their\\nfertility is unimpaired?\\n\\nThe two first heads shall be here discussed--Instinct and Hybridism in\\nseparate chapters.\\n\\n\\n\\n_On the absence or rarity of transitional varieties._--As natural selection\\nacts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications, each new form\\nwill tend in a fully-stocked country to take the place of, and finally to\\nexterminate, its own less improved parent or other less-favoured forms with\\nwhich it comes into competition. Thus extinction and natural selection\\nwill, as we have seen, go hand in hand. Hence, if we look at each species\\nas descended from some other unknown form, both the parent and all the\\ntransitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very\\nprocess of formation and perfection of the new form.\\n\\nBut, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed,\\nwhy do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the\\nearth? It will be much more convenient to discuss this question in the\\nchapter on the Imperfection of the geological record; and I will here only\\nstate that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record being\\nincomparably less perfect than is generally supposed; the imperfection of\\nthe record being chiefly due to organic beings not inhabiting {173}\\nprofound depths of the sea, and to their remains being embedded and\\npreserved to a future age only in masses of sediment sufficiently thick and\\nextensive to withstand an enormous amount of future degradation; and such\\nfossiliferous masses can be accumulated only where much sediment is\\ndeposited on the shallow bed of the sea, whilst it slowly subsides. These\\ncontingencies will concur only rarely, and after enormously long intervals.\\nWhilst the bed of the sea is stationary or is rising, or when very little\\nsediment is being deposited, there will be blanks in our geological\\nhistory. The crust of the earth is a vast museum; but the natural\\ncollections have been made only at intervals of time immensely remote.\\n\\nBut it may be urged that when several closely-allied species inhabit the\\nsame territory we surely ought to find at the present time many\\ntransitional forms. Let us take a simple case: in travelling from north to\\nsouth over a continent, we generally meet at successive intervals with\\nclosely allied or representative species, evidently filling nearly the same\\nplace in the natural economy of the land. These representative species\\noften meet and interlock; and as the one becomes rarer and rarer, the other\\nbecomes more and more frequent, till the one replaces the other. But if we\\ncompare these species where they intermingle, they are generally as\\nabsolutely distinct from each other in every detail of structure as are\\nspecimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each. By my theory these\\nallied species have descended from a common parent; and during the process\\nof modification, each has become adapted to the conditions of life of its\\nown region, and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent and all\\nthe transitional varieties between its past and present states. Hence we\\nought not to expect at the {174} present time to meet with numerous\\ntransitional varieties in each region, though they must have existed there,\\nand may be embedded there in a fossil condition. But in the intermediate\\nregion, having intermediate conditions of life, why do we not now find\\nclosely-linking intermediate varieties? This difficulty for a long time\\nquite confounded me. But I think it can be in large part explained.\\n\\nIn the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring, because an\\narea is now continuous, that it has been continuous during a long period.\\nGeology would lead us to believe that almost every continent has been\\nbroken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods; and in such\\nislands distinct species might have been separately formed without the\\npossibility of intermediate varieties existing in the intermediate zones.\\nBy changes in the form of the land and of climate, marine areas now\\ncontinuous must often have existed within recent times in a far less\\ncontinuous and uniform condition than at present. But I will pass over this\\nway of escaping from the difficulty; for I believe that many perfectly\\ndefined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas; though I do\\nnot doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas now continuous has\\nplayed an important part in the formation of new species, more especially\\nwith freely-crossing and wandering animals.\\n\\nIn looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area, we\\ngenerally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory, then\\nbecoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines, and finally\\ndisappearing. Hence the neutral territory between two representative\\nspecies is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to\\neach. We see the same fact in ascending mountains, and sometimes {175} it\\nis quite remarkable how abruptly, as Alph. de Candolle has observed, a\\ncommon alpine species disappears. The same fact has been noticed by E.\\nForbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge. To those who look\\nat climate and the physical conditions of life as the all-important\\nelements of distribution, these facts ought to cause surprise, as climate\\nand height or depth graduate away insensibly. But when we bear in mind that\\nalmost every species, even in its metropolis, would increase immensely in\\nnumbers, were it not for other competing species; that nearly all either\\nprey on or serve as prey for others; in short, that each organic being is\\neither directly or indirectly related in the most important manner to other\\norganic beings, we must see that the range of the inhabitants of any\\ncountry by no means exclusively depends on insensibly changing physical\\nconditions, but in large part on the presence of other species, on which it\\ndepends, or by which it is destroyed, or with which it comes into\\ncompetition; and as these species are already defined objects (however they\\nmay have become so), not blending one into another by insensible\\ngradations, the range of any one species, depending as it does on the range\\nof others, will tend to be sharply defined. Moreover, each species on the\\nconfines of its range, where it exists in lessened numbers, will, during\\nfluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey, or in the\\nseasons, be extremely liable to utter extermination; and thus its\\ngeographical range will come to be still more sharply defined.\\n\\nIf I am right in believing that allied or representative species, when\\ninhabiting a continuous area, are generally so distributed that each has a\\nwide range, with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them, in\\nwhich they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as varieties do\\nnot essentially differ from species, {176} the same rule will probably\\napply to both; and if we in imagination adapt a varying species to a very\\nlarge area, we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a\\nthird variety to a narrow intermediate zone. The intermediate variety,\\nconsequently, will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and\\nlesser area; and practically, as far as I can make out, this rule holds\\ngood with varieties in a state of nature. I have met with striking\\ninstances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between\\nwell-marked varieties in the genus Balanus. And it would appear from\\ninformation given me by Mr. Watson, Dr. Asa Gray, and Mr. Wollaston, that\\ngenerally when varieties intermediate between two other forms occur, they\\nare much rarer numerically than the forms which they connect. Now, if we\\nmay trust these facts and inferences, and therefore conclude that varieties\\nlinking two other varieties together have generally existed in lesser\\nnumbers than the forms which they connect, then, I think, we can understand\\nwhy intermediate varieties should not endure for very long periods;--why as\\na general rule they should be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the\\nforms which they originally linked together.\\n\\nFor any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked, run a\\ngreater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers;\\nand in this particular case the intermediate form would be eminently liable\\nto the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both sides of it. But a\\nfar more important consideration, as I believe, is that, during the process\\nof further modification, by which two varieties are supposed on my theory\\nto be converted and perfected into two distinct species, the two which\\nexist in larger numbers from inhabiting larger areas, will have a great\\nadvantage over the intermediate variety, which exists {177} in smaller\\nnumbers in a narrow and intermediate zone. For forms existing in larger\\nnumbers will always have a better chance, within any given period, of\\npresenting further favourable variations for natural selection to seize on,\\nthan will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers. Hence, the more\\ncommon forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the less\\ncommon forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved. It is\\nthe same principle which, as I believe, accounts for the common species in\\neach country, as shown in the second chapter, presenting on an average a\\ngreater number of well-marked varieties than do the rarer species. I may\\nillustrate what I mean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept,\\none adapted to an extensive mountainous region; a second to a comparatively\\nnarrow, hilly tract; and a third to wide plains at the base; and that the\\ninhabitants are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their\\nstocks by selection; the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of\\nthe great holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds\\nmore quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow, hilly\\ntract; and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soon take\\nthe place of the less improved hill breed; and thus the two breeds, which\\noriginally existed in greater numbers, will come into close contact with\\neach other, without the interposition of the supplanted, intermediate\\nhill-variety.\\n\\nTo sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined\\nobjects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of\\nvarying and intermediate links: firstly, because new varieties are very\\nslowly formed, for variation is a very slow process, and natural selection\\ncan do nothing until favourable {178} variations chance to occur, and until\\na place in the natural polity of the country can be better filled by some\\nmodification of some one or more of its inhabitants. And such new places\\nwill depend on slow changes of climate, or on the occasional immigration of\\nnew inhabitants, and, probably, in a still more important degree, on some\\nof the old inhabitants becoming slowly modified, with the new forms thus\\nproduced and the old ones acting and reacting on each other. So that, in\\nany one region and at any one time, we ought only to see a few species\\npresenting slight modifications of structure in some degree permanent; and\\nthis assuredly we do see.\\n\\nSecondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the recent\\nperiod in isolated portions, in which many forms, more especially amongst\\nthe classes which unite for each birth and wander much, may have separately\\nbeen rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative species. In\\nthis case, intermediate varieties between the several representative\\nspecies and their common parent, must formerly have existed in each broken\\nportion of the land, but these links will have been supplanted and\\nexterminated during the process of natural selection, so that they will no\\nlonger exist in a living state.\\n\\nThirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different portions\\nof a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will, it is probable,\\nat first have been formed in the intermediate zones, but they will\\ngenerally have had a short duration. For these intermediate varieties will,\\nfrom reasons already assigned (namely from what we know of the actual\\ndistribution of closely allied or representative species, and likewise of\\nacknowledged varieties), exist in the intermediate zones in lesser numbers\\nthan the varieties which they {179} tend to connect. From this cause alone\\nthe intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental extermination; and\\nduring the process of further modification through natural selection, they\\nwill almost certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they\\nconnect; for these from existing in greater numbers will, in the aggregate,\\npresent more variation, and thus be further improved through natural\\nselection and gain further advantages.\\n\\nLastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be true,\\nnumberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all the species of\\nthe same group together, must assuredly have existed; but the very process\\nof natural selection constantly tends, as has been so often remarked, to\\nexterminate the parent-forms and the intermediate links. Consequently\\nevidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil\\nremains, which are preserved, as we shall in a future chapter attempt to\\nshow, in an extremely imperfect and intermittent record.\\n\\n\\n\\n_On the origin and transitions of organic beings with peculiar habits and\\nstructure._--It has been asked by the opponents of such views as I hold,\\nhow, for instance, a land carnivorous animal could have been converted into\\none with aquatic habits; for how could the animal in its transitional state\\nhave subsisted? It would be easy to show that within the same group\\ncarnivorous animals exist having every intermediate grade between truly\\naquatic and strictly terrestrial habits; and as each exists by a struggle\\nfor life, it is clear that each is well adapted in its habits to its place\\nin nature. Look at the Mustela vison of North America, which has webbed\\nfeet and which resembles an otter in its fur, short legs, and form of tail;\\nduring summer this animal {180} dives for and preys on fish, but during the\\nlong winter it leaves the frozen waters, and preys like other polecats on\\nmice and land animals. If a different case had been taken, and it had been\\nasked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted\\ninto a flying bat, the question would have been far more difficult, and I\\ncould have given no answer. Yet I think such difficulties have very little\\nweight.\\n\\nHere, as on other occasions, I lie under a heavy disadvantage, for out of\\nthe many striking cases which I have collected, I can give only one or two\\ninstances of transitional habits and structures in closely allied species\\nof the same genus; and of diversified habits, either constant or\\noccasional, in the same species. And it seems to me that nothing less than\\na long list of such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in any\\nparticular case like that of the bat.\\n\\nLook at the family of squirrels; here we have the finest gradation from\\nanimals with their tails only slightly flattened, and from others, as Sir\\nJ. Richardson has remarked, with the posterior part of their bodies rather\\nwide and with the skin on their flanks rather full, to the so-called flying\\nsquirrels; and flying squirrels have their limbs and even the base of the\\ntail united by a broad expanse of skin, which serves as a parachute and\\nallows them to glide through the air to an astonishing distance from tree\\nto tree. We cannot doubt that each structure is of use to each kind of\\nsquirrel in its own country, by enabling it to escape birds or beasts of\\nprey, or to collect food more quickly, or, as there is reason to believe,\\nby lessening the danger from occasional falls. But it does not follow from\\nthis fact that the structure of each squirrel is the best that it is\\npossible to conceive under all natural conditions. Let the climate and\\nvegetation change, let other competing {181} rodents or new beasts of prey\\nimmigrate, or old ones become modified, and all analogy would lead us to\\nbelieve that some at least of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or\\nbecome exterminated, unless they also became modified and improved in\\nstructure in a corresponding manner. Therefore, I can see no difficulty,\\nmore especially under changing conditions of life, in the continued\\npreservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flank-membranes, each\\nmodification being useful, each being propagated, until by the accumulated\\neffects of this process of natural selection, a perfect so-called flying\\nsquirrel was produced.\\n\\nNow look at the Galeopithecus or flying lemur, which formerly was falsely\\nranked amongst bats. It has an extremely wide flank-membrane, stretching\\nfrom the corners of the jaw to the tail, and including the limbs and the\\nelongated fingers: the flank-membrane is, also, furnished with an extensor\\nmuscle. Although no graduated links of structure, fitted for gliding\\nthrough the air, now connect the Galeopithecus with the other LemuridГ¦, yet\\nI see no difficulty in supposing that such links formerly existed, and that\\neach had been formed by the same steps as in the case of the less perfectly\\ngliding squirrels; and that each grade of structure was useful to its\\npossessor. Nor can I see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it\\npossible that the membrane-connected fingers and forearm of the\\nGaleopithecus might be greatly lengthened by natural selection; and this,\\nas far as the organs of flight are concerned, would convert it into a bat.\\nIn bats which have the wing-membrane extended from the top of the shoulder\\nto the tail, including the hind-legs, we perhaps see traces of an apparatus\\noriginally constructed for gliding through the air rather than for flight.\\n{182}\\n\\nIf about a dozen genera of birds had become extinct or were unknown, who\\nwould have ventured to have surmised that birds might have existed which\\nused their wings solely as flappers, like the logger-headed duck\\n(Micropterus of Eyton); as fins in the water and front legs on the land,\\nlike the penguin; as sails, like the ostrich; and functionally for no\\npurpose, like the Apteryx. Yet the structure of each of these birds is good\\nfor it, under the conditions of life to which it is exposed, for each has\\nto live by a struggle; but it is not necessarily the best possible under\\nall possible conditions. It must not be inferred from these remarks that\\nany of the grades of wing-structure here alluded to, which perhaps may all\\nhave resulted from disuse, indicate the natural steps by which birds have\\nacquired their perfect power of flight; but they serve, at least, to show\\nwhat diversified means of transition are possible.\\n\\nSeeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the Crustacea\\nand Mollusca are adapted to live on the land; and seeing that we have\\nflying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most diversified types, and\\nformerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable that flying-fish, which now\\nglide far through the air, slightly rising and turning by the aid of their\\nfluttering fins, might have been modified into perfectly winged animals. If\\nthis had been effected, who would have ever imagined that in an early\\ntransitional state they had been inhabitants of the open ocean, and had\\nused their incipient organs of flight exclusively, as far as we know, to\\nescape being devoured by other fish?\\n\\nWhen we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit, as the\\nwings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that animals displaying\\nearly {183} transitional grades of the structure will seldom continue to\\nexist to the present day, for they will have been supplanted by the very\\nprocess of perfection through natural selection. Furthermore, we may\\nconclude that transitional grades between structures fitted for very\\ndifferent habits of life will rarely have been developed at an early period\\nin great numbers and under many subordinate forms. Thus, to return to our\\nimaginary illustration of the flying-fish, it does not seem probable that\\nfishes capable of true flight would have been developed under many\\nsubordinate forms, for taking prey of many kinds in many ways, on the land\\nand in the water, until their organs of flight had come to a high stage of\\nperfection, so as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals\\nin the battle for life. Hence the chance of discovering species with\\ntransitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always be less,\\nfrom their having existed in lesser numbers, than in the case of species\\nwith fully developed structures.\\n\\nI will now give two or three instances of diversified and of changed habits\\nin the individuals of the same species. When either case occurs, it would\\nbe easy for natural selection to fit the animal, by some modification of\\nits structure, for its changed habits, or exclusively for one of its\\nseveral different habits. But it is difficult to tell, and immaterial for\\nus, whether habits generally change first and structure afterwards; or\\nwhether slight modifications of structure lead to changed habits; both\\nprobably often change almost simultaneously. Of cases of changed habits it\\nwill suffice merely to allude to that of the many British insects which now\\nfeed on exotic plants, or exclusively on artificial substances. Of\\ndiversified habits innumerable instances could be given: I have often\\nwatched a tyrant flycatcher (Saurophagus sulphuratus) in South America,\\nhovering over one spot {184} and then proceeding to another, like a\\nkestrel, and at other times standing stationary on the margin of water, and\\nthen dashing like a kingfisher at a fish. In our own country the larger\\ntitmouse (Parus major) may be seen climbing branches, almost like a\\ncreeper; it often, like a shrike, kills small birds by blows on the head;\\nand I have many times seen and heard it hammering the seeds of the yew on a\\nbranch, and thus breaking them like a nuthatch. In North America the black\\nbear was seen by Hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus\\ncatching, almost like a whale, insects in the water.\\n\\nAs we sometimes see individuals of a species following habits widely\\ndifferent from those of their own species and of the other species of the\\nsame genus, we might expect, on my theory, that such individuals would\\noccasionally have given rise to new species, having anomalous habits, and\\nwith their structure either slightly or considerably modified from that of\\ntheir proper type. And such instances do occur in nature. Can a more\\nstriking instance of adaptation be given than that of a woodpecker for\\nclimbing trees and for seizing insects in the chinks of the bark? Yet in\\nNorth America there are woodpeckers which feed largely on fruit, and others\\nwith elongated wings which chase insects on the wing; and on the plains of\\nLa Plata, where not a tree grows, there is a woodpecker, which in every\\nessential part of its organisation, even in its colouring, in the harsh\\ntone of its voice, and undulatory flight, told me plainly of its close\\nblood-relationship to our common species; yet it is a woodpecker which\\nnever climbs a tree!\\n\\nPetrels are the most aГ«rial and oceanic of birds, yet in the quiet Sounds\\nof Tierra del Fuego, the Puffinuria berardi, in its general habits, in its\\nastonishing power of diving, its manner of swimming, and of flying when\\n{185} unwillingly it takes flight, would be mistaken by any one for an auk\\nor grebe; nevertheless, it is essentially a petrel, but with many parts of\\nits organisation profoundly modified. On the other hand, the acutest\\nobserver by examining the dead body of the water-ouzel would never have\\nsuspected its sub-aquatic habits; yet this anomalous member of the strictly\\nterrestrial thrush family wholly subsists by diving,--grasping the stones\\nwith its feet and using its wings under water.\\n\\nHe who believes that each being has been created as we now see it, must\\noccasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having\\nhabits and structure not at all in agreement. What can be plainer than that\\nthe webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? yet there are\\nupland geese with webbed feet which rarely or never go near the water; and\\nno one except Audubon has seen the frigate-bird, which has all its four\\ntoes webbed, alight on the surface of the sea. On the other hand grebes and\\ncoots are eminently aquatic, although their toes are only bordered by\\nmembrane. What seems plainer than that the long toes of grallatores are\\nformed for walking over swamps and floating plants, yet the water-hen is\\nnearly as aquatic as the coot; and the landrail nearly as terrestrial as\\nthe quail or partridge. In such cases, and many others could be given,\\nhabits have changed without a corresponding change of structure. The webbed\\nfeet of the upland goose may be said to have become rudimentary in\\nfunction, though not in structure. In the frigate-bird, the deeply-scooped\\nmembrane between the toes shows that structure has begun to change.\\n\\nHe who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation will say, that\\nin these cases it has pleased the Creator to cause a being of one type to\\ntake the place of one of another type; but this seems to me only {186}\\nrestating the fact in dignified language. He who believes in the struggle\\nfor existence and in the principle of natural selection, will acknowledge\\nthat every organic being is constantly endeavouring to increase in numbers;\\nand that if any one being vary ever so little, either in habits or\\nstructure, and thus gain an advantage over some other inhabitant of the\\ncountry, it will seize on the place of that inhabitant, however different\\nit may be from its own place. Hence it will cause him no surprise that\\nthere should be geese and frigate-birds with webbed feet, living on the dry\\nland or most rarely alighting on the water; that there should be long-toed\\ncorncrakes living in meadows instead of in swamps; that there should be\\nwoodpeckers where not a tree grows; that there should be diving thrushes,\\nand petrels with the habits of auks.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Organs of extreme perfection and complication._--To suppose that the eye,\\nwith all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different\\ndistances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction\\nof spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural\\nselection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.\\nYet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex\\neye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its\\npossessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so\\nslightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and\\nif any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal\\nunder changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a\\nperfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though\\ninsuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real. How a nerve\\ncomes to be sensitive to {187} light, hardly concerns us more than how life\\nitself first originated; but I may remark that several facts make me\\nsuspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light, and\\nlikewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound.\\n\\nIn looking for the gradations by which an organ in any species has been\\nperfected, we ought to look exclusively to its lineal ancestors; but this\\nis scarcely ever possible, and we are forced in each case to look to\\nspecies of the same group, that is to the collateral descendants from the\\nsame original parent-form, in order to see what gradations are possible,\\nand for the chance of some gradations having been transmitted from the\\nearlier stages of descent, in an unaltered or little altered condition.\\nAmongst existing Vertebrata, we find but a small amount of gradation in the\\nstructure of the eye, and from fossil species we can learn nothing on this\\nhead. In this great class we should probably have to descend far beneath\\nthe lowest known fossiliferous stratum to discover the earlier stages, by\\nwhich the eye has been perfected.\\n\\nIn the Articulata we can commence a series with an optic nerve merely\\ncoated with pigment, and without any other mechanism; and from this low\\nstage, numerous gradations of structure, branching off in two fundamentally\\ndifferent lines, can be shown to exist, until we reach a moderately high\\nstage of perfection. In certain crustaceans, for instance, there is a\\ndouble cornea, the inner one divided into facets, within each of which\\nthere is a lens-shaped swelling. In other crustaceans the transparent cones\\nwhich are coated by pigment, and which properly act only by excluding\\nlateral pencils of light, are convex at their upper ends and must act by\\nconvergence; and at their lower ends there seems to be an imperfect\\nvitreous substance. {188} With these facts, here far too briefly and\\nimperfectly given, which show that there is much graduated diversity in the\\neyes of living crustaceans, and bearing in mind how small the number of\\nliving animals is in proportion to those which have become extinct, I can\\nsee no very great difficulty (not more than in the case of many other\\nstructures) in believing that natural selection has converted the simple\\napparatus of an optic nerve merely coated with pigment and invested by\\ntransparent membrane, into an optical instrument as perfect as is possessed\\nby any member of the great Articulate class.\\n\\nHe who will go thus far, if he find on finishing this treatise that large\\nbodies of facts, otherwise inexplicable, can be explained by the theory of\\ndescent, ought not to hesitate to go further, and to admit that a structure\\neven as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formed by natural\\nselection, although in this case he does not know any of the transitional\\ngrades. His reason ought to conquer his imagination; though I have felt the\\ndifficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any degree of hesitation in\\nextending the principle of natural selection to such startling lengths.\\n\\nIt is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope. We know\\nthat this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued efforts of\\nthe highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been\\nformed by a somewhat analogous process. But may not this inference be\\npresumptuous? Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by\\nintellectual powers like those of man? If we must compare the eye to an\\noptical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of\\ntransparent tissue, with a nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then\\nsuppose every part of this layer to be continually changing {189} slowly in\\ndensity, so as to separate into layers of different densities and\\nthicknesses, placed at different distances from each other, and with the\\nsurfaces of each layer slowly changing in form. Further we must suppose\\nthat there is a power always intently watching each slight accidental\\nalteration in the transparent layers; and carefully selecting each\\nalteration which, under varied circumstances, may in any way, or in any\\ndegree, tend to produce a distincter image. We must suppose each new state\\nof the instrument to be multiplied by the million; and each to be preserved\\ntill a better be produced, and then the old ones to be destroyed. In living\\nbodies, variation will cause the slight alterations, generation will\\nmultiply them almost infinitely, and natural selection will pick out with\\nunerring skill each improvement. Let this process go on for millions on\\nmillions of years; and during each year on millions of individuals of many\\nkinds; and may we not believe that a living optical instrument might thus\\nbe formed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the Creator are to\\nthose of man?\\n\\nIf it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not\\npossibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my\\ntheory would absolutely break down. But I can find out no such case. No\\ndoubt many organs exist of which we do not know the transitional grades,\\nmore especially if we look to much-isolated species, round which, according\\nto my theory, there has been much extinction. Or again, if we look to an\\norgan common to all the members of a large class, for in this latter case\\nthe organ must have been first formed at an extremely remote period, since\\nwhich all the many members of the class have been developed; and in order\\nto discover the early transitional grades through which the organ has {190}\\npassed, we should have to look to very ancient ancestral forms, long since\\nbecome extinct.\\n\\nWe should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not have\\nbeen formed by transitional gradations of some kind. Numerous cases could\\nbe given amongst the lower animals of the same organ performing at the same\\ntime wholly distinct functions; thus the alimentary canal respires,\\ndigests, and excretes in the larva of the dragon-fly and in the fish\\nCobites. In the Hydra, the animal may be turned inside out, and the\\nexterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire. In such cases\\nnatural selection might easily specialise, if any advantage were thus\\ngained, a part or organ, which had performed two functions, for one\\nfunction alone, and thus wholly change its nature by insensible steps. Two\\ndistinct organs sometimes perform simultaneously the same function in the\\nsame individual; to give one instance, there are fish with gills or\\nbranchiГ¦ that breathe the air dissolved in the water, at the same time that\\nthey breathe free air in their swimbladders, this latter organ having a\\nductus pneumaticus for its supply, and being divided by highly vascular\\npartitions. In these cases one of the two organs might with ease be\\nmodified and perfected so as to perform all the work by itself, being aided\\nduring the process of modification by the other organ; and then this other\\norgan might be modified for some other and quite distinct purpose, or be\\nquite obliterated.\\n\\nThe illustration of the swimbladder in fishes is a good one, because it\\nshows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally\\nconstructed for one purpose, namely flotation, may be converted into one\\nfor a wholly different purpose, namely respiration. The swimbladder has,\\nalso, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain\\nfish, or, for I do not know {191} which view is now generally held, a part\\nof the auditory apparatus has been worked in as a complement to the\\nswimbladder. All physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous, or\\n\"ideally similar\" in position and structure with the lungs of the higher\\nvertebrate animals: hence there seems to me to be no great difficulty in\\nbelieving that natural selection has actually converted a swimbladder into\\na lung, or organ used exclusively for respiration.\\n\\nI can, indeed, hardly doubt that all vertebrate animals having true lungs\\nhave descended by ordinary generation from an ancient prototype, of which\\nwe know nothing, furnished with a floating apparatus or swimbladder. We can\\nthus, as I infer from Professor Owen\\'s interesting description of these\\nparts, understand the strange fact that every particle of food and drink\\nwhich we swallow has to pass over the orifice of the trachea, with some\\nrisk of falling into the lungs, notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance\\nby which the glottis is closed. In the higher Vertebrata the branchiГ¦ have\\nwholly disappeared--the slits on the sides of the neck and the loop-like\\ncourse of the arteries still marking in the embryo their former position.\\nBut it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiГ¦ might have been\\ngradually worked in by natural selection for some quite distinct purpose:\\nin the same manner as, on the view entertained by some naturalists that the\\nbranchiГ¦ and dorsal scales of Annelids are homologous with the wings and\\nwing-covers of insects, it is probable that organs which at a very ancient\\nperiod served for respiration have been actually converted into organs of\\nflight.\\n\\nIn considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear in mind\\nthe probability of conversion from one function to another, that I will\\ngive one more instance. Pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of\\nskin, {192} called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve, through the\\nmeans of a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they are hatched\\nwithin the sack. These cirripedes have no branchiГ¦, the whole surface of\\nthe body and sack, including the small frena, serving for respiration. The\\nBalanidГ¦ or sessile cirripedes, on the other hand, have no ovigerous frena,\\nthe eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack, in the well-enclosed shell;\\nbut they have large folded branchiГ¦. Now I think no one will dispute that\\nthe ovigerous frena in the one family are strictly homologous with the\\nbranchiГ¦ of the other family; indeed, they graduate into each other.\\nTherefore I do not doubt that little folds of skin, which originally served\\nas ovigerous frena, but which, likewise, very slightly aided the act of\\nrespiration, have been gradually converted by natural selection into\\nbranchiГ¦, simply through an increase in their size and the obliteration of\\ntheir adhesive glands. If all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct,\\nand they have already suffered far more extinction than have sessile\\ncirripedes, who would ever have imagined that the branchiГ¦ in this latter\\nfamily had originally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being\\nwashed out of the sack?\\n\\nAlthough we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ could\\nnot possibly have been produced by successive transitional gradations, yet,\\nundoubtedly, grave cases of difficulty occur, some of which will be\\ndiscussed in my future work.\\n\\nOne of the gravest is that of neuter insects, which are often very\\ndifferently constructed from either the males or fertile females; but this\\ncase will be treated of in the next chapter. The electric organs of fishes\\noffer another case of special difficulty; it is impossible to conceive by\\nwhat steps these wondrous organs have been produced; but, as Owen and\\nothers have remarked, {193} their intimate structure closely resembles that\\nof common muscle; and as it has lately been shown that Rays have an organ\\nclosely analogous to the electric apparatus, and yet do not, as Matteucci\\nasserts, discharge any electricity, we must own that we are far too\\nignorant to argue that no transition of any kind is possible.\\n\\nThe electric organs offer another and even more serious difficulty; for\\nthey occur in only about a dozen fishes, of which several are widely remote\\nin their affinities. Generally when the same organ appears in several\\nmembers of the same class, especially if in members having very different\\nhabits of life, we may attribute its presence to inheritance from a common\\nancestor; and its absence in some of the members to its loss through disuse\\nor natural selection. But if the electric organs had been inherited from\\none ancient progenitor thus provided, we might have expected that all\\nelectric fishes would have been specially related to each other. Nor does\\ngeology at all lead to the belief that formerly most fishes had electric\\norgans, which most of their modified descendants have lost. The presence of\\nluminous organs in a few insects, belonging to different families and\\norders, offers a parallel case of difficulty. Other cases could be given;\\nfor instance in plants, the very curious contrivance of a mass of\\npollen-grains, borne on a foot-stalk with a sticky gland at the end, is the\\nsame in Orchis and Asclepias,--genera almost as remote as possible amongst\\nflowering plants. In all these cases of two very distinct species furnished\\nwith apparently the same anomalous organ, it should be observed that,\\nalthough the general appearance and function of the organ may be the same,\\nyet some fundamental difference can generally be detected. I am inclined to\\nbelieve that in nearly the same way as two men have sometimes independently\\nhit on {194} the very same invention, so natural selection, working for the\\ngood of each being and taking advantage of analogous variations, has\\nsometimes modified in very nearly the same manner two parts in two organic\\nbeings, which beings owe but little of their structure in common to\\ninheritance from the same ancestor.\\n\\nAlthough in many cases it is most difficult to conjecture by what\\ntransitions organs could have arrived at their present state; yet,\\nconsidering that the proportion of living and known forms to the extinct\\nand unknown is very small, I have been astonished how rarely an organ can\\nbe named, towards which no transitional grade is known to lead. The truth\\nof this remark is indeed shown by that old but somewhat exaggerated canon\\nin natural history of \"Natura non facit saltum.\" We meet with this\\nadmission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or, as\\nMilne Edwards has well expressed it, Nature is prodigal in variety, but\\nniggard in innovation. Why, on the theory of Creation, should this be so?\\nWhy should all the parts and organs of many independent beings, each\\nsupposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature, be\\nso commonly linked together by graduated steps? Why should not Nature have\\ntaken a leap from structure to structure? On the theory of natural\\nselection, we can clearly understand why she should not; for natural\\nselection can act only by taking advantage of slight successive variations;\\nshe can never take a leap, but must advance by the shortest and slowest\\nsteps.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Organs of little apparent importance._--As natural selection acts by life\\nand death,--by the preservation of individuals with any favourable\\nvariation, and by the destruction of those with any unfavourable deviation\\nof structure,--I have sometimes felt much difficulty in {195} understanding\\nthe origin of simple parts, of which the importance does not seem\\nsufficient to cause the preservation of successively varying individuals. I\\nhave sometimes felt as much difficulty, though of a very different kind, on\\nthis head, as in the case of an organ as perfect and complex as the eye.\\n\\nIn the first place, we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole economy\\nof any one organic being, to say what slight modifications would be of\\nimportance or not. In a former chapter I have given instances of most\\ntrifling characters, such as the down on fruit and the colour of its flesh,\\nwhich, from determining the attacks of insects or from being correlated\\nwith constitutional differences, might assuredly be acted on by natural\\nselection. The tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially constructed\\nfly-flapper; and it seems at first incredible that this could have been\\nadapted for its present purpose by successive slight modifications, each\\nbetter and better, for so trifling an object as driving away flies; yet we\\nshould pause before being too positive even in this case, for we know that\\nthe distribution and existence of cattle and other animals in South America\\nabsolutely depends on their power of resisting the attacks of insects: so\\nthat individuals which could by any means defend themselves from these\\nsmall enemies, would be able to range into new pastures and thus gain a\\ngreat advantage. It is not that the larger quadrupeds are actually\\ndestroyed (except in some rare cases) by flies, but they are incessantly\\nharassed and their strength reduced, so that they are more subject to\\ndisease, or not so well enabled in a coming dearth to search for food, or\\nto escape from beasts of prey.\\n\\nOrgans now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of high\\nimportance to an early progenitor, and, after having been slowly perfected\\nat a {196} former period, have been transmitted in nearly the same state,\\nalthough now become of very slight use; and any actually injurious\\ndeviations in their structure will always have been checked by natural\\nselection. Seeing how important an organ of locomotion the tail is in most\\naquatic animals, its general presence and use for many purposes in so many\\nland animals, which in their lungs or modified swimbladders betray their\\naquatic origin, may perhaps be thus accounted for. A well-developed tail\\nhaving been formed in an aquatic animal, it might subsequently come to be\\nworked in for all sorts of purposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ of\\nprehension, or as an aid in turning, as with the dog, though the aid must\\nbe slight, for the hare, with hardly any tail, can double quickly enough.\\n\\nIn the second place, we may sometimes attribute importance to characters\\nwhich are really of very little importance, and which have originated from\\nquite secondary causes, independently of natural selection. We should\\nremember that climate, food, &c., probably have some little direct\\ninfluence on the organisation; that characters reappear from the law of\\nreversion; that correlation of growth will have had a most important\\ninfluence in modifying various structures; and finally, that sexual\\nselection will often have largely modified the external characters of\\nanimals having a will, to give one male an advantage in fighting with\\nanother or in charming the females. Moreover when a modification of\\nstructure has primarily arisen from the above or other unknown causes, it\\nmay at first have been of no advantage to the species, but may subsequently\\nhave been taken advantage of by the descendants of the species under new\\nconditions of life and with newly acquired habits.\\n\\nTo give a few instances to illustrate these latter {197} remarks. If green\\nwoodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that there were many\\nblack and pied kinds, I dare say that we should have thought that the green\\ncolour was a beautiful adaptation to hide this tree-frequenting bird from\\nits enemies; and consequently that it was a character of importance and\\nmight have been acquired through natural selection; as it is, I have no\\ndoubt that the colour is due to some quite distinct cause, probably to\\nsexual selection. A trailing bamboo in the Malay Archipelago climbs the\\nloftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around\\nthe ends of the branches, and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest\\nservice to the plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees\\nwhich are not climbers, the hooks on the bamboo may have arisen from\\nunknown laws of growth, and have been subsequently taken advantage of by\\nthe plant undergoing further modification and becoming a climber. The naked\\nskin on the head of a vulture is generally looked at as a direct adaptation\\nfor wallowing in putridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due to\\nthe direct action of putrid matter; but we should be very cautious in\\ndrawing any such inference, when we see that the skin on the head of the\\nclean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked. The sutures in the skulls of\\nyoung mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding\\nparturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable for this\\nact; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles, which\\nhave only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that this structure has\\narisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken advantage of in the\\nparturition of the higher animals.\\n\\nWe are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant\\nvariations; and we are {198} immediately made conscious of this by\\nreflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals in\\ndifferent countries,--more especially in the less civilised countries where\\nthere has been but little artificial selection. Careful observers are\\nconvinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair, and that with\\nthe hair the horns are correlated. Mountain breeds always differ from\\nlowland breeds; and a mountainous country would probably affect the hind\\nlimbs from exercising them more, and possibly even the form of the pelvis;\\nand then by the law of homologous variation, the front limbs and even the\\nhead would probably be affected. The shape, also, of the pelvis might\\naffect by pressure the shape of the head of the young in the womb. The\\nlaborious breathing necessary in high regions would, we have some reason to\\nbelieve, increase the size of the chest; and again correlation would come\\ninto play. Animals kept by savages in different countries often have to\\nstruggle for their own subsistence, and would be exposed to a certain\\nextent to natural selection, and individuals with slightly different\\nconstitutions would succeed best under different climates; and there is\\nreason to believe that constitution and colour are correlated. A good\\nobserver, also, states that in cattle susceptibility to the attacks of\\nflies is correlated with colour, as is the liability to be poisoned by\\ncertain plants; so that colour would be thus subjected to the action of\\nnatural selection. But we are far too ignorant to speculate on the relative\\nimportance of the several known and unknown laws of variation; and I have\\nhere alluded to them only to show that, if we are unable to account for the\\ncharacteristic differences of our domestic breeds, which nevertheless we\\ngenerally admit to have arisen through ordinary generation, we ought not to\\nlay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause {199} of the\\nslight analogous differences between species. I might have adduced for this\\nsame purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so\\nstrongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown\\non the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a\\nparticular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning\\nwould appear frivolous.\\n\\nThe foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately made\\nby some naturalists, against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of\\nstructure has been produced for the good of its possessor. They believe\\nthat very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man,\\nor for mere variety. This doctrine, if true, would be absolutely fatal to\\nmy theory. Yet I fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to\\ntheir possessors. Physical conditions probably have had some little effect\\non structure, quite independently of any good thus gained. Correlation of\\ngrowth has no doubt played a most important part, and a useful modification\\nof one part will often have entailed on other parts diversified changes of\\nno direct use. So again characters which formerly were useful, or which\\nformerly had arisen from correlation of growth, or from other unknown\\ncause, may reappear from the law of reversion, though now of no direct use.\\nThe effects of sexual selection, when displayed in beauty to charm the\\nfemales, can be called useful only in rather a forced sense. But by far the\\nmost important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of\\nevery being is simply due to inheritance; and consequently, though each\\nbeing assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature, many structures now\\nhave no direct relation to the habits of life of each species. Thus, we can\\nhardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland {200} goose or of the\\nfrigate-bird are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe that the\\nsame bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore-leg of the horse, in the\\nwing of the bat, and in the nipper of the seal, are of special use to these\\nanimals. We may safely attribute these structures to inheritance. But to\\nthe progenitor of the upland goose and of the frigate-bird, webbed feet no\\ndoubt were as useful as they now are to the most aquatic of existing birds.\\nSo we may believe that the progenitor of the seal had not a nipper, but a\\nfoot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping; and we may further\\nventure to believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey,\\nhorse, and bat, which have been inherited from a common progenitor, were\\nformerly of more special use to that progenitor, or its progenitors, than\\nthey now are to these animals having such widely diversified habits.\\nTherefore we may infer that these several bones might have been acquired\\nthrough natural selection, subjected formerly, as now, to the several laws\\nof inheritance, reversion, correlation of growth, &c. Hence every detail of\\nstructure in every living creature (making some little allowance for the\\ndirect action of physical conditions) may be viewed, either as having been\\nof special use to some ancestral form, or as being now of special use to\\nthe descendants of this form--either directly, or indirectly through the\\ncomplex laws of growth.\\n\\nNatural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in any one\\nspecies exclusively for the good of another species; though throughout\\nnature one species incessantly takes advantage of, and profits by, the\\nstructure of another. But natural selection can and does often produce\\nstructures for the direct injury of other species, as we see in the fang of\\nthe adder, and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon, by which its eggs are\\n{201} deposited in the living bodies of other insects. If it could be\\nproved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed\\nfor the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory,\\nfor such could not have been produced through natural selection. Although\\nmany statements may be found in works on natural history to this effect, I\\ncannot find even one which seems to me of any weight. It is admitted that\\nthe rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its own defence and for the\\ndestruction of its prey; but some authors suppose that at the same time\\nthis snake is furnished with a rattle for its own injury, namely, to warn\\nits prey to escape. I would almost as soon believe that the cat curls the\\nend of its tail when preparing to spring, in order to warn the doomed\\nmouse. But I have not space here to enter on this and other such cases.\\n\\nNatural selection will never produce in a being anything injurious to\\nitself, for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of each. No\\norgan will be formed, as Paley has remarked, for the purpose of causing\\npain or for doing an injury to its possessor. If a fair balance be struck\\nbetween the good and evil caused by each part, each will be found on the\\nwhole advantageous. After the lapse of time, under changing conditions of\\nlife, if any part comes to be injurious, it will be modified; or if it be\\nnot so, the being will become extinct, as myriads have become extinct.\\n\\nNatural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as, or\\nslightly more perfect than, the other inhabitants of the same country with\\nwhich it has to struggle for existence. And we see that this is the degree\\nof perfection attained under nature. The endemic productions of New\\nZealand, for instance, are perfect one compared with another; but they are\\nnow rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants {202} and\\nanimals introduced from Europe. Natural selection will not produce absolute\\nperfection, nor do we always meet, as far as we can judge, with this high\\nstandard under nature. The correction for the aberration of light is said,\\non high authority, not to be perfect even in that most perfect organ, the\\neye. If our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of\\ninimitable contrivances in nature, this same reason tells us, though we may\\neasily err on both sides, that some other contrivances are less perfect.\\nCan we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee as perfect, which, when\\nused against many attacking animals, cannot be withdrawn, owing to the\\nbackward serratures, and so inevitably causes the death of the insect by\\ntearing out its viscera?\\n\\nIf we look at the sting of the bee, as having originally existed in a\\nremote progenitor as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in so many\\nmembers of the same great order, and which has been modified but not\\nperfected for its present purpose, with the poison originally adapted to\\ncause galls subsequently intensified, we can perhaps understand how it is\\nthat the use of the sting should so often cause the insect\\'s own death: for\\nif on the whole the power of stinging be useful to the community, it will\\nfulfil all the requirements of natural selection, though it may cause the\\ndeath of some few members. If we admire the truly wonderful power of scent\\nby which the males of many insects find their females, can we admire the\\nproduction for this single purpose of thousands of drones, which are\\nutterly useless to the community for any other end, and which are\\nultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters? It may be\\ndifficult, but we ought to admire the savage instinctive hatred of the\\nqueen-bee, which urges her instantly to destroy the {203} young queens her\\ndaughters as soon as born, or to perish herself in the combat; for\\nundoubtedly this is for the good of the community; and maternal love or\\nmaternal hatred, though the latter fortunately is most rare, is all the\\nsame to the inexorable principle of natural selection. If we admire the\\nseveral ingenious contrivances, by which the flowers of the orchis and of\\nmany other plants are fertilised through insect agency, can we consider as\\nequally perfect the elaboration by our fir-trees of dense clouds of pollen,\\nin order that a few granules may be wafted by a chance breeze on to the\\novules?\\n\\n\\n\\n_Summary of Chapter._--We have in this chapter discussed some of the\\ndifficulties and objections which may be urged against my theory. Many of\\nthem are very serious; but I think that in the discussion light has been\\nthrown on several facts, which on the theory of independent acts of\\ncreation are utterly obscure. We have seen that species at any one period\\nare not indefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude\\nof intermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural selection\\nwill always be very slow, and will act, at any one time, only on a very few\\nforms; and partly because the very process of natural selection almost\\nimplies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and\\nintermediate gradations. Closely allied species, now living on a continuous\\narea, must often have been formed when the area was not continuous, and\\nwhen the conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part\\nto another. When two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous\\narea, an intermediate variety will often be formed, fitted for an\\nintermediate zone; but from reasons assigned, the intermediate variety will\\nusually exist in lesser numbers than {204} the two forms which it connects;\\nconsequently the two latter, during the course of further modification,\\nfrom existing in greater numbers, will have a great advantage over the less\\nnumerous intermediate variety, and will thus generally succeed in\\nsupplanting and exterminating it.\\n\\nWe have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding that\\nthe most different habits of life could not graduate into each other; that\\na bat, for instance, could not have been formed by natural selection from\\nan animal which at first could only glide through the air.\\n\\nWe have seen that a species may under new conditions of life change its\\nhabits, or have diversified habits, with some habits very unlike those of\\nits nearest congeners. Hence we can understand, bearing in mind that each\\norganic being is trying to live wherever it can live, how it has arisen\\nthat there are upland geese with webbed feet, ground woodpeckers, diving\\nthrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks.\\n\\nAlthough the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been\\nformed by natural selection, is more than enough to stagger any one; yet in\\nthe case of any organ, if we know of a long series of gradations in\\ncomplexity, each good for its possessor, then, under changing conditions of\\nlife there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any\\nconceivable degree of perfection through natural selection. In the cases in\\nwhich we know of no intermediate or transitional states, we should be very\\ncautious in concluding that none could have existed, for the homologies of\\nmany organs and their intermediate states show that wonderful metamorphoses\\nin function are at least possible. For instance, a swim-bladder has\\napparently been converted into an air-breathing lung. The same organ having\\nperformed {205} simultaneously very different functions, and then having\\nbeen specialised for one function; and two very distinct organs having\\nperformed at the same time the same function, the one having been perfected\\nwhilst aided by the other, must often have largely facilitated transitions.\\n\\nWe are far too ignorant, in almost every case, to be enabled to assert that\\nany part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species, that\\nmodifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated by\\nmeans of natural selection. But we may confidently believe that many\\nmodifications, wholly due to the laws of growth, and at first in no way\\nadvantageous to a species, have been subsequently taken advantage of by the\\nstill further modified descendants of this species. We may, also, believe\\nthat a part formerly of high importance has often been retained (as the\\ntail of an aquatic animal by its terrestrial descendants), though it has\\nbecome of such small importance that it could not, in its present state,\\nhave been acquired by natural selection,--a power which acts solely by the\\npreservation of profitable variations in the struggle for life.\\n\\nNatural selection will produce nothing in one species for the exclusive\\ngood or injury of another; though it may well produce parts, organs, and\\nexcretions highly useful or even indispensable, or highly injurious to\\nanother species, but in all cases at the same time useful to the owner.\\nNatural selection in each well-stocked country, must act chiefly through\\nthe competition of the inhabitants one with another, and consequently will\\nproduce perfection, or strength in the battle for life, only according to\\nthe standard of that country. Hence the inhabitants of one country,\\ngenerally the smaller one, will often yield, as we see they do yield, to\\nthe inhabitants of another and generally larger country. For in {206} the\\nlarger country there will have existed more individuals, and more\\ndiversified forms, and the competition will have been severer, and thus the\\nstandard of perfection will have been rendered higher. Natural selection\\nwill not necessarily produce absolute perfection; nor, as far as we can\\njudge by our limited faculties, can absolute perfection be everywhere\\nfound.\\n\\nOn the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full\\nmeaning of that old canon in natural history, \"Natura non facit saltum.\"\\nThis canon, if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world, is not\\nstrictly correct, but if we include all those of past times, it must by my\\ntheory be strictly true.\\n\\nIt is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on\\ntwo great laws--Unity of Type, and the Conditions of Existence. By unity of\\ntype is meant that fundamental agreement in structure, which we see in\\norganic beings of the same class, and which is quite independent of their\\nhabits of life. On my theory, unity of type is explained by unity of\\ndescent. The expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted on by\\nthe illustrious Cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of natural\\nselection. For natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying\\nparts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life; or by\\nhaving adapted them during long-past periods of time: the adaptations being\\naided in some cases by use and disuse, being slightly affected by the\\ndirect action of the external conditions of life, and being in all cases\\nsubjected to the several laws of growth. Hence, in fact, the law of the\\nConditions of Existence is the higher law; as it includes, through the\\ninheritance of former adaptations, that of Unity of Type.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{207}\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nINSTINCT.\\n\\n    Instincts comparable with habits, but different in their\\n    origin--Instincts graduated--Aphides and ants--Instincts\\n    variable--Domestic instincts, their origin--Natural instincts of the\\n    cuckoo, ostrich, and parasitic bees--Slave-making-ants--Hive-bee, its\\n    cell-making instinct--Difficulties on the theory of the Natural\\n    Selection of instincts--Neuter or sterile insects--Summary.\\n\\nThe subject of instinct might have been worked into the previous chapters;\\nbut I have thought that it would be more convenient to treat the subject\\nseparately, especially as so wonderful an instinct as that of the hive-bee\\nmaking its cells will probably have occurred to many readers, as a\\ndifficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole theory. I must premise, that I\\nhave nothing to do with the origin of the primary mental powers, any more\\nthan I have with that of life itself. We are concerned only with the\\ndiversities of instinct and of the other mental qualities of animals within\\nthe same class.\\n\\nI will not attempt any definition of instinct. It would be easy to show\\nthat several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term;\\nbut every one understands what is meant, when it is said that instinct\\nimpels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds\\' nests. An\\naction, which we ourselves should require experience to enable us to\\nperform, when performed by an animal, more especially by a very young one,\\nwithout any experience, and when performed by many individuals in the same\\nway, without their knowing for what purpose it is performed, is usually\\nsaid to be instinctive. {208} But I could show that none of these\\ncharacters of instinct are universal. A little dose, as Pierre Huber\\nexpresses it, of judgment or reason, often comes into play, even in animals\\nvery low in the scale of nature.\\n\\nFrederick Cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared\\ninstinct with habit. This comparison gives, I think, a remarkably accurate\\nnotion of the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed,\\nbut not of its origin. How unconsciously many habitual actions are\\nperformed, indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious will!\\nyet they may be modified by the will or reason. Habits easily become\\nassociated with other habits, and with certain periods of time and states\\nof the body. When once acquired, they often remain constant throughout\\nlife. Several other points of resemblance between instincts and habits\\ncould be pointed out. As in repeating a well-known song, so in instincts,\\none action follows another by a sort of rhythm; if a person be interrupted\\nin a song, or in repeating anything by rote, he is generally forced to go\\nback to recover the habitual train of thought: so P. Huber found it was\\nwith a caterpillar, which makes a very complicated hammock; for if he took\\na caterpillar which had completed its hammock up to, say, the sixth stage\\nof construction, and put it into a hammock completed up only to the third\\nstage, the caterpillar simply re-performed the fourth, fifth, and sixth\\nstages of construction. If, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a\\nhammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one\\nfinished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work, was already done\\nfor it, far from feeling the benefit of this, it was much embarrassed, and,\\nin order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third\\nstage, where it had left off, and thus tried to complete the already\\nfinished work. {209}\\n\\nIf we suppose any habitual action to become inherited--and I think it can\\nbe shown that this does sometimes happen--then the resemblance between what\\noriginally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be\\ndistinguished. If Mozart, instead of playing the pianoforte at three years\\nold with wonderfully little practice, had played a tune with no practice at\\nall, he might truly be said to have done so instinctively. But it would be\\nthe most serious error to suppose that the greater number of instincts have\\nbeen acquired by habit in one generation, and then transmitted by\\ninheritance to succeeding generations. It can be clearly shown that the\\nmost wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted, namely, those of the\\nhive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly have been thus acquired.\\n\\nIt will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as\\ncorporeal structure for the welfare of each species, under its present\\nconditions of life. Under changed conditions of life, it is at least\\npossible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a\\nspecies; and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little, then\\nI can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually\\naccumulating variations of instinct to any extent that may be profitable.\\nIt is thus, as I believe, that all the most complex and wonderful instincts\\nhave originated. As modifications of corporeal structure arise from, and\\nare increased by, use or habit, and are diminished or lost by disuse, so I\\ndo not doubt it has been with instincts. But I believe that the effects of\\nhabit are of quite subordinate importance to the effects of the natural\\nselection of what may be called accidental variations of instincts;--that\\nis of variations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight\\ndeviations of bodily structure.\\n\\nNo complex instinct can possibly be produced through {210} natural\\nselection, except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous, slight,\\nyet profitable, variations. Hence, as in the case of corporeal structures,\\nwe ought to find in nature, not the actual transitional gradations by which\\neach complex instinct has been acquired--for these could be found only in\\nthe lineal ancestors of each species--but we ought to find in the\\ncollateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations; or we ought\\nat least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are possible; and\\nthis we certainly can do. I have been surprised to find, making allowance\\nfor the instincts of animals having been but little observed except in\\nEurope and North America, and for no instinct being known amongst extinct\\nspecies, how very generally gradations, leading to the most complex\\ninstincts, can be discovered. Changes of instinct may sometimes be\\nfacilitated by the same species having different instincts at different\\nperiods of life, or at different seasons of the year, or when placed under\\ndifferent circumstances &c.; in which case either one or the other instinct\\nmight be preserved by natural selection. And such instances of diversity of\\ninstinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature.\\n\\nAgain as in the case of corporeal structure, and conformably with my\\ntheory, the instinct of each species is good for itself, but has never, as\\nfar as we can judge, been produced for the exclusive good of others. One of\\nthe strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an action for\\nthe sole good of another, with which I am acquainted, is that of aphides\\nvoluntarily yielding their sweet excretion to ants: that they do so\\nvoluntarily, the following facts show. I removed all the ants from a group\\nof about a dozen aphides on a dock-plant, and prevented their attendance\\nduring several hours. After this interval, I felt sure that the aphides\\n{211} would want to excrete. I watched them for some time through a lens,\\nbut not one excreted; I then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the\\nsame manner, as well as I could, as the ants do with their antennГ¦; but not\\none excreted. Afterwards I allowed an ant to visit them, and it immediately\\nseemed, by its eager way of running about, to be well aware what a rich\\nflock it had discovered; it then began to play with its antennГ¦ on the\\nabdomen first of one aphis and then of another; and each aphis, as soon as\\nit felt the antennГ¦, immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a\\nlimpid drop of sweet juice, which was eagerly devoured by the ant. Even the\\nquite young aphides behaved in this manner, showing that the action was\\ninstinctive, and not the result of experience. But as the excretion is\\nextremely viscid, it is probably a convenience to the aphides to have it\\nremoved; and therefore probably the aphides do not instinctively excrete\\nfor the sole good of the ants. Although I do not believe that any animal in\\nthe world performs an action for the exclusive good of another of a\\ndistinct species, yet each species tries to take advantage of the instincts\\nof others, as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of\\nothers. So again, in some few cases, certain instincts cannot be considered\\nas absolutely perfect; but as details on this and other such points are not\\nindispensable, they may be here passed over.\\n\\nAs some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature, and the\\ninheritance of such variations, are indispensable for the action of natural\\nselection, as many instances as possible ought to be here given; but want\\nof space prevents me. I can only assert, that instincts certainly do\\nvary--for instance, the migratory instinct, both in extent and direction,\\nand in its total loss. So it is with the nests of birds, which vary partly\\n{212} in dependence on the situations chosen, and on the nature and\\ntemperature of the country inhabited, but often from causes wholly unknown\\nto us: Audubon has given several remarkable cases of differences in the\\nnests of the same species in the northern and southern United States. Fear\\nof any particular enemy is certainly an instinctive quality, as may be seen\\nin nestling birds, though it is strengthened by experience, and by the\\nsight of fear of the same enemy in other animals. But fear of man is slowly\\nacquired, as I have elsewhere shown, by various animals inhabiting desert\\nislands; and we may see an instance of this, even in England, in the\\ngreater wildness of all our large birds than of our small birds; for the\\nlarge birds have been most persecuted by man. We may safely attribute the\\ngreater wildness of our large birds to this cause; for in uninhabited\\nislands large birds are not more fearful than small; and the magpie, so\\nwary in England, is tame in Norway, as is the hooded crow in Egypt.\\n\\nThat the general disposition of individuals of the same species, born in a\\nstate of nature, is extremely diversified, can be shown by a multitude of\\nfacts. Several cases also, could be given, of occasional and strange habits\\nin certain species, which might, if advantageous to the species, give rise,\\nthrough natural selection, to quite new instincts. But I am well aware that\\nthese general statements, without facts given in detail, can produce but a\\nfeeble effect on the reader\\'s mind. I can only repeat my assurance, that I\\ndo not speak without good evidence.\\n\\nThe possibility, or even probability, of inherited variations of instinct\\nin a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly considering a few\\ncases under domestication. We shall thus also be enabled to see the\\nrespective parts which habit and the selection of {213} so-called\\naccidental variations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our\\ndomestic animals. A number of curious and authentic instances could be\\ngiven of the inheritance of all shades of disposition and tastes, and\\nlikewise of the oddest tricks, associated with certain frames of mind or\\nperiods of time. But let us look to the familiar case of the several breeds\\nof dogs: it cannot be doubted that young pointers (I have myself seen a\\nstriking instance) will sometimes point and even back other dogs the very\\nfirst time that they are taken out; retrieving is certainly in some degree\\ninherited by retrievers; and a tendency to run round, instead of at, a\\nflock of sheep, by shepherd-dogs. I cannot see that these actions,\\nperformed without experience by the young, and in nearly the same manner by\\neach individual, performed with eager delight by each breed, and without\\nthe end being known,--for the young pointer can no more know that he points\\nto aid his master, than the white butterfly knows why she lays her eggs on\\nthe leaf of the cabbage,--I cannot see that these actions differ\\nessentially from true instincts. If we were to see one kind of wolf, when\\nyoung and without any training, as soon as it scented its prey, stand\\nmotionless like a statue, and then slowly crawl forward with a peculiar\\ngait; and another kind of wolf rushing round, instead of at, a herd of\\ndeer, and driving them to a distant point, we should assuredly call these\\nactions instinctive. Domestic instincts, as they may be called, are\\ncertainly far less fixed or invariable than natural instincts; but they\\nhave been acted on by far less rigorous selection, and have been\\ntransmitted for an incomparably shorter period, under less fixed conditions\\nof life.\\n\\nHow strongly these domestic instincts, habits, and dispositions are\\ninherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well shown when\\ndifferent breeds of dogs are {214} crossed. Thus it is known that a cross\\nwith a bull-dog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy\\nof greyhounds; and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family of\\nshepherd-dogs a tendency to hunt hares. These domestic instincts, when thus\\ntested by crossing, resemble natural instincts, which in a like manner\\nbecome curiously blended together, and for a long period exhibit traces of\\nthe instincts of either parent: for example, Le Roy describes a dog, whose\\ngreat-grandfather was a wolf, and this dog showed a trace of its wild\\nparentage only in one way, by not coming in a straight line to his master\\nwhen called.\\n\\nDomestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become\\ninherited solely from long-continued and compulsory habit, but this, I\\nthink, is not true. No one would ever have thought of teaching, or probably\\ncould have taught, the tumbler-pigeon to tumble,--an action which, as I\\nhave witnessed, is performed by young birds, that have never seen a pigeon\\ntumble. We may believe that some one pigeon showed a slight tendency to\\nthis strange habit, and that the long-continued selection of the best\\nindividuals in successive generations made tumblers what they now are; and\\nnear Glasgow there are house-tumblers, as I hear from Mr. Brent, which\\ncannot fly eighteen inches high without going head over heels. It may be\\ndoubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to point, had\\nnot some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line; and this is known\\noccasionally to happen, as I once saw in a pure terrier: the act of\\npointing is probably, as many have thought, only the exaggerated pause of\\nan animal preparing to spring on its prey. When the first tendency to point\\nwas once displayed, methodical selection and the inherited effects of\\ncompulsory training in each successive generation would soon complete the\\n{215} work; and unconscious selection is still at work, as each man tries\\nto procure, without intending to improve the breed, dogs which will stand\\nand hunt best. On the other hand, habit alone in some cases has sufficed;\\nno animal is more difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit;\\nscarcely any animal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit; but I do\\nnot suppose that domestic rabbits have ever been selected for tameness; and\\nI presume that we must attribute the whole of the inherited change from\\nextreme wildness to extreme tameness, simply to habit and long-continued\\nclose confinement.\\n\\nNatural instincts are lost under domestication: a remarkable instance of\\nthis is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become\\n\"broody,\" that is, never wish to sit on their eggs. Familiarity alone\\nprevents our seeing how universally and largely the minds of our domestic\\nanimals have been modified by domestication. It is scarcely possible to\\ndoubt that the love of man has become instinctive in the dog. All wolves,\\nfoxes, jackals, and species of the cat genus, when kept tame, are most\\neager to attack poultry, sheep, and pigs; and this tendency has been found\\nincurable in dogs which have been brought home as puppies from countries,\\nsuch as Tierra del Fuego and Australia, where the savages do not keep these\\ndomestic animals. How rarely, on the other hand, do our civilised dogs,\\neven when quite young, require to be taught not to attack poultry, sheep,\\nand pigs! No doubt they occasionally do make an attack, and are then\\nbeaten; and if not cured, they are destroyed; so that habit, with some\\ndegree of selection, has probably concurred in civilising by inheritance\\nour dogs. On the other hand, young chickens have lost, wholly by habit,\\nthat fear of the dog and cat which no doubt was originally instinctive in\\nthem, in the same way as it is so plainly instinctive in {216} young\\npheasants, though reared under a hen. It is not that chickens have lost all\\nfear, but fear only of dogs and cats, for if the hen gives the\\ndanger-chuckle, they will run (more especially young turkeys) from under\\nher, and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass or thickets; and this\\nis evidently done for the instinctive purpose of allowing, as we see in\\nwild ground-birds, their mother to fly away. But this instinct retained by\\nour chickens has become useless under domestication, for the mother-hen has\\nalmost lost by disuse the power of flight.\\n\\nHence, we may conclude, that domestic instincts have been acquired and\\nnatural instincts have been lost partly by habit, and partly by man\\nselecting and accumulating during successive generations, peculiar mental\\nhabits and actions, which at first appeared from what we must in our\\nignorance call an accident. In some cases compulsory habit alone has\\nsufficed to produce such inherited mental changes; in other cases\\ncompulsory habit has done nothing, and all has been the result of\\nselection, pursued both methodically and unconsciously; but in most cases,\\nprobably, habit and selection have acted together.\\n\\nWe shall, perhaps, best understand how instincts in a state of nature have\\nbecome modified by selection, by considering a few cases. I will select\\nonly three, out of the several which I shall have to discuss in my future\\nwork,--namely, the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay her eggs in other\\nbirds\\' nests; the slave-making instinct of certain ants; and the\\ncomb-making power of the hive-bee; these two latter instincts have\\ngenerally, and most justly, been ranked by naturalists as the most\\nwonderful of all known instincts.\\n\\nIt is now commonly admitted that the more immediate and final cause of the\\ncuckoo\\'s instinct is, that {217} she lays her eggs, not daily, but at\\nintervals of two or three days; so that, if she were to make her own nest\\nand sit on her own eggs, those first laid would have to be left for some\\ntime unincubated, or there would be eggs and young birds of different ages\\nin the same nest. If this were the case, the process of laying and hatching\\nmight be inconveniently long, more especially as she has to migrate at a\\nvery early period; and the first hatched young would probably have to be\\nfed by the male alone. But the American cuckoo is in this predicament; for\\nshe makes her own nest and has eggs and young successively hatched, all at\\nthe same time. It has been asserted that the American cuckoo occasionally\\nlays her eggs in other birds\\' nests; but I hear on the high authority of\\nDr. Brewer, that this is a mistake. Nevertheless, I could give several\\ninstances of various birds which have been known occasionally to lay their\\neggs in other birds\\' nests. Now let us suppose that the ancient progenitor\\nof our European cuckoo had the habits of the American cuckoo; but that\\noccasionally she laid an egg in another bird\\'s nest. If the old bird\\nprofited by this occasional habit, or if the young were made more vigorous\\nby advantage having been taken of the mistaken maternal instinct of another\\nbird, than by their own mother\\'s care, encumbered as she can hardly fail to\\nbe by having eggs and young of different ages at the same time; then the\\nold birds or the fostered young would gain an advantage. And analogy would\\nlead me to believe, that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by\\ninheritance the occasional and aberrant habit of their mother, and in their\\nturn would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds\\' nests, and thus be\\nsuccessful in rearing their young. By a continued process of this nature, I\\nbelieve that the strange instinct of our cuckoo could be, and has been,\\n{218} generated. I may add that, according to Dr. Gray and to some other\\nobservers, the European cuckoo has not utterly lost all maternal love and\\ncare for her own offspring.\\n\\nThe occasional habit of birds laying their eggs in other birds\\' nests,\\neither of the same or of a distinct species, is not very uncommon with the\\nGallinaceГ¦; and this perhaps explains the origin of a singular instinct in\\nthe allied group of ostriches. For several hen ostriches, at least in the\\ncase of the American species, unite and lay first a few eggs in one nest\\nand then in another; and these are hatched by the males. This instinct may\\nprobably be accounted for by the fact of the hens laying a large number of\\neggs; but, as in the case of the cuckoo, at intervals of two or three days.\\nThis instinct, however, of the American ostrich has not as yet been\\nperfected; for a surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the plains, so\\nthat in one day\\'s hunting I picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted\\neggs.\\n\\nMany bees are parasitic, and always lay their eggs in the nests of bees of\\nother kinds. This case is more remarkable than that of the cuckoo; for\\nthese bees have not only their instincts but their structure modified in\\naccordance with their parasitic habits; for they do not possess the\\npollen-collecting apparatus which would be necessary if they had to store\\nfood for their own young. Some species, likewise, of SphegidГ¦ (wasp-like\\ninsects) are parasitic on other species; and M. Fabre has lately shown good\\nreason for believing that although the Tachytes nigra generally makes its\\nown burrow and stores it with paralysed prey for its own larvГ¦ to feed on,\\nyet that when this insect finds a burrow already made and stored by another\\nsphex, it takes advantage of the prize, and becomes for the occasion\\nparasitic. In this case, as with the supposed case of the cuckoo, I can\\n{219} see no difficulty in natural selection making an occasional habit\\npermanent, if of advantage to the species, and if the insect whose nest and\\nstored food are thus feloniously appropriated, be not thus exterminated.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Slave-making instinct._--This remarkable instinct was first discovered in\\nthe Formica (Polyerges) rufescens by Pierre Huber, a better observer even\\nthan his celebrated father. This ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves;\\nwithout their aid, the species would certainly become extinct in a single\\nyear. The males and fertile females do no work. The workers or sterile\\nfemales, though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves, do no\\nother work. They are incapable of making their own nests, or of feeding\\ntheir own larvГ¦. When the old nest is found inconvenient, and they have to\\nmigrate, it is the slaves which determine the migration, and actually carry\\ntheir masters in their jaws. So utterly helpless are the masters, that when\\nHuber shut up thirty of them without a slave, but with plenty of the food\\nwhich they like best, and with their larvae and pupГ¦ to stimulate them to\\nwork, they did nothing; they could not even feed themselves, and many\\nperished of hunger. Huber then introduced a single slave (F. fusca), and\\nshe instantly set to work, fed and saved the survivors; made some cells and\\ntended the larvГ¦, and put all to rights. What can be more extraordinary\\nthan these well-ascertained facts? If we had not known of any other\\nslave-making ant, it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so\\nwonderful an instinct could have been perfected.\\n\\nAnother species, Formica sanguinea, was likewise first discovered by P.\\nHuber to be a slave-making ant. This species is found in the southern parts\\nof England, and its habits have been attended to by Mr. F. Smith, of {220}\\nthe British Museum, to whom I am much indebted for information on this and\\nother subjects. Although fully trusting to the statements of Huber and Mr.\\nSmith, I tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame of mind, as any\\none may well be excused for doubting the truth of so extraordinary and\\nodious an instinct as that of making slaves. Hence I will give the\\nobservations which I have myself made, in some little detail. I opened\\nfourteen nests of F. sanguinea, and found a few slaves in all. Males and\\nfertile females of the slave-species (F. fusca) are found only in their own\\nproper communities, and have never been observed in the nests of F.\\nsanguinea. The slaves are black and not above half the size of their red\\nmasters, so that the contrast in their appearance is very great. When the\\nnest is slightly disturbed, the slaves occasionally come out, and like\\ntheir masters are much agitated and defend the nest: when the nest is much\\ndisturbed and the larvГ¦ and pupГ¦ are exposed, the slaves work energetically\\nwith their masters in carrying them away to a place of safety. Hence, it is\\nclear, that the slaves feel quite at home. During the months of June and\\nJuly, on three successive years, I have watched for many hours several\\nnests in Surrey and Sussex, and never saw a slave either leave or enter a\\nnest. As, during these months, the slaves are very few in number, I thought\\nthat they might behave differently when more numerous; but Mr. Smith\\ninforms me that he has watched the nests at various hours during May, June\\nand August, both in Surrey and Hampshire, and has never seen the slaves,\\nthrough present in large numbers in August, either leave or enter the nest.\\nHence he considers them as strictly household slaves. The masters, on the\\nother hand, may be constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest, and\\nfood of all kinds. During the present year, however, in the month {221} of\\nJuly, I came across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves,\\nand I observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest,\\nand marching along the same road to a tall Scotch-fir-tree, twenty-five\\nyards distant, which they ascended together, probably in search of aphides\\nor cocci. According to Huber, who had ample opportunities for observation,\\nin Switzerland the slaves habitually work with their masters in making the\\nnest, and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening;\\nand, as Huber expressly states, their principal office is to search for\\naphides. This difference in the usual habits of the masters and slaves in\\nthe two countries, probably depends merely on the slaves being captured in\\ngreater numbers in Switzerland than in England.\\n\\nOne day I fortunately witnessed a migration of F. sanguinea from one nest\\nto another, and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the masters\\ncarefully carrying (instead of being carried by, as in the case of F.\\nrufescens) their slaves in their jaws. Another day my attention was struck\\nby about a score of the slave-makers haunting the same spot, and evidently\\nnot in search of food; they approached and were vigorously repulsed by an\\nindependent community of the slave-species (F. fusca); sometimes as many as\\nthree of these ants clinging to the legs of the slave-making F. sanguinea.\\nThe latter ruthlessly killed their small opponents, and carried their dead\\nbodies as food to their nest, twenty-nine yards distant; but they were\\nprevented from getting any pupГ¦ to rear as slaves. I then dug up a small\\nparcel of the pupГ¦ of F. fusca from another nest, and put them down on a\\nbare spot near the place of combat; they were eagerly seized, and carried\\noff by the tyrants, who perhaps fancied that, after all, they had been\\nvictorious in their late combat. {222}\\n\\nAt the same time I laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupГ¦ of\\nanother species, F. flava, with a few of these little yellow ants still\\nclinging to the fragments of the nest. This species is sometimes, though\\nrarely, made into slaves, as has been described by Mr. Smith. Although so\\nsmall a species, it is very courageous, and I have seen it ferociously\\nattack other ants. In one instance I found to my surprise an independent\\ncommunity of F. flava under a stone beneath a nest of the slave-making F.\\nsanguinea; and when I had accidentally disturbed both nests, the little\\nants attacked their big neighbours with surprising courage. Now I was\\ncurious to ascertain whether F. sanguinea could distinguish the pupГ¦ of F.\\nfusca, which they habitually make into slaves, from those of the little and\\nfurious F. flava, which they rarely capture, and it was evident that they\\ndid at once distinguish them: for we have seen that they eagerly and\\ninstantly seized the pupГ¦ of F. fusca, whereas they were much terrified\\nwhen they came across the pupГ¦, or even the earth from the nest of F.\\nflava, and quickly ran away; but in about a quarter of an hour, shortly\\nafter all the little yellow ants had crawled away, they took heart and\\ncarried off the pupГ¦.\\n\\nOne evening I visited another community of F. sanguinea, and found a number\\nof these ants returning home and entering their nests, carrying the dead\\nbodies of F. fusca (showing that it was not a migration) and numerous pupГ¦.\\nI traced a long file of ants burthened with booty, for about forty yards,\\nto a very thick clump of heath, whence I saw the last individual of F.\\nsanguinea emerge, carrying a pupa; but I was not able to find the desolated\\nnest in the thick heath. The nest, however, must have been close at hand,\\nfor two or three individuals of F. fusca were rushing about in the greatest\\n{223} agitation, and one was perched motionless with its own pupa in its\\nmouth on the top of a spray of heath, an image of despair, over its ravaged\\nhome.\\n\\nSuch are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in regard\\nto the wonderful instinct of making slaves. Let it be observed what a\\ncontrast the instinctive habits of F. sanguinea present with those of the\\ncontinental F. rufescens. The latter does not build its own nest, does not\\ndetermine its own migrations, does not collect food for itself or its\\nyoung, and cannot even feed itself: it is absolutely dependent on its\\nnumerous slaves. Formica sanguinea, on the other hand, possesses much fewer\\nslaves, and in the early part of the summer extremely few: the masters\\ndetermine when and where a new nest shall be formed, and when they migrate,\\nthe masters carry the slaves. Both in Switzerland and England the slaves\\nseem to have the exclusive care of the larvГ¦, and the masters alone go on\\nslave-making expeditions. In Switzerland the slaves and masters work\\ntogether, making and bringing materials for the nest: both, but chiefly the\\nslaves, tend, and milk as it may be called, their aphides; and thus both\\ncollect food for the community. In England the masters alone usually leave\\nthe nest to collect building materials and food for themselves, their\\nslaves and larvГ¦. So that the masters in this country receive much less\\nservice from their slaves than they do in Switzerland.\\n\\nBy what steps the instinct of F. sanguinea originated I will not pretend to\\nconjecture. But as ants, which are not slave-makers, will, as I have seen,\\ncarry off pupГ¦ of other species, if scattered near their nests, it is\\npossible that such pupГ¦ originally stored as food might become developed;\\nand the foreign ants thus unintentionally reared would then follow their\\nproper instincts, and do {224} what work they could. If their presence\\nproved useful to the species which had seized them--if it were more\\nadvantageous to this species to capture workers than to procreate them--the\\nhabit of collecting pupae originally for food might by natural selection be\\nstrengthened and rendered permanent for the very different purpose of\\nraising slaves. When the instinct was once acquired, if carried out to a\\nmuch less extent even than in our British F. sanguinea, which, as we have\\nseen, is less aided by its slaves than the same species in Switzerland, I\\ncan see no difficulty in natural selection increasing and modifying the\\ninstinct--always supposing each modification to be of use to the\\nspecies--until an ant was formed as abjectly dependent on its slaves as is\\nthe Formica rufescens.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Cell-making instinct of the Hive-Bee._--I will not here enter on minute\\ndetails on this subject, but will merely give an outline of the conclusions\\nat which I have arrived. He must be a dull man who can examine the\\nexquisite structure of a comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without\\nenthusiastic admiration. We hear from mathematicians that bees have\\npractically solved a recondite problem, and have made their cells of the\\nproper shape to hold the greatest possible amount of honey, with the least\\npossible consumption of precious wax in their construction. It has been\\nremarked that a skilful workman, with fitting tools and measures, would\\nfind it very difficult to make cells of wax of the true form, though this\\nis perfectly effected by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive. Grant\\nwhatever instincts you please, and it seems at first quite inconceivable\\nhow they can make all the necessary angles and planes, or even perceive\\nwhen they are correctly made. But the difficulty is not {225} nearly so\\ngreat as it at first appears: all this beautiful work can be shown, I\\nthink, to follow from a few very simple instincts.\\n\\nI was led to investigate this subject by Mr. Waterhouse, who has shown that\\nthe form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of adjoining\\ncells; and the following view may, perhaps, be considered only as a\\nmodification of his theory. Let us look to the great principle of\\ngradation, and see whether Nature does not reveal to us her method of work.\\nAt one end of a short series we have humble-bees, which use their old\\ncocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax, and\\nlikewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax. At the\\nother end of the series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in a\\ndouble layer: each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism, with the\\nbasal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to fit on to a pyramid, formed\\nof three rhombs. These rhombs have certain angles, and the three which form\\nthe pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb, enter into the\\ncomposition of the bases of three adjoining cells on the opposite side. In\\nthe series between the extreme perfection of the cells of the hive-bee and\\nthe simplicity of those of the humble-bee, we have the cells of the Mexican\\nMelipona domestica, carefully described and figured by Pierre Huber. The\\nMelipona itself is intermediate in structure between the hive and humble\\nbee, but more nearly related to the latter: it forms a nearly regular waxen\\ncomb of cylindrical cells, in which the young are hatched, and, in\\naddition, some large cells of wax for holding honey. These latter cells are\\nnearly spherical and of nearly equal sizes, and are aggregated into an\\nirregular mass. But the important point to notice, is that these cells are\\nalways made at that degree of nearness to each other, that they would have\\n{226} intersected or broken into each other, if the spheres had been\\ncompleted; but this is never permitted, the bees building perfectly flat\\nwalls of wax between the spheres which thus tend to intersect. Hence each\\ncell consists of an outer spherical portion and of two, three, or more\\nperfectly flat surfaces, according as the cell adjoins two, three, or more\\nother cells. When one cell comes into contact with three other cells,\\nwhich, from the spheres being nearly of the same size, is very frequently\\nand necessarily the case, the three flat surfaces are united into a\\npyramid; and this pyramid, as Huber has remarked, is manifestly a gross\\nimitation of the three-sided pyramidal bases of the cell of the hive-bee.\\nAs in the cells of the hive-bee, so here, the three plane surfaces in any\\none cell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells.\\nIt is obvious that the Melipona saves wax by this manner of building; for\\nthe flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double, but are of the\\nsame thickness as the outer spherical portions, and yet each flat portion\\nforms a part of two cells.\\n\\nReflecting on this case, it occurred to me that if the Melipona had made\\nits spheres at some given distance from each other, and had made them of\\nequal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer, the\\nresulting structure would probably have been as perfect as the comb of the\\nhive-bee. Accordingly I wrote to Professor Miller, of Cambridge, and this\\ngeometer has kindly read over the following statement, drawn up from his\\ninformation, and tells me that it is strictly correct:--\\n\\nIf a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in two\\nparallel layers; with the centre of each sphere at the distance of radius Г—\\n[root]2, or radius Г— 1.41421 (or at some lesser distance), from the centres\\nof the six surrounding spheres in the same {227} layer; and at the same\\ndistance from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the other and\\nparallel layer; then, if planes of intersection between the several spheres\\nin both layers be formed, there will result a double layer of hexagonal\\nprisms united together by pyramidal bases formed of three rhombs; and the\\nrhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will have every angle\\nidentically the same with the best measurements which have been made of the\\ncells of the hive-bee.\\n\\nHence we may safely conclude that if we could slightly modify the instincts\\nalready possessed by the Melipona, and in themselves not very wonderful,\\nthis bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as that of the\\nhive-bee. We must suppose the Melipona to make her cells truly spherical,\\nand of equal sizes; and this would not be very surprising, seeing that she\\nalready does so to a certain extent, and seeing what perfectly cylindrical\\nburrows in wood many insects can make, apparently by turning round on a\\nfixed point. We must suppose the Melipona to arrange her cells in level\\nlayers, as she already does her cylindrical cells; and we must further\\nsuppose, and this is the greatest difficulty, that she can somehow judge\\naccurately at what distance to stand from her fellow-labourers when several\\nare making their spheres; but she is already so far enabled to judge of\\ndistance, that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect largely;\\nand then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces.\\nWe have further to suppose, but this is no difficulty, that after hexagonal\\nprisms have been formed by the intersection of adjoining spheres in the\\nsame layer, she can prolong the hexagon to any length requisite to hold the\\nstock of honey; in the same way as the rude humble-bee adds cylinders of\\nwax to the circular mouths of her old cocoons. By such {228} modifications\\nof instincts in themselves not very wonderful,--hardly more wonderful than\\nthose which guide a bird to make its nest,--I believe that the hive-bee has\\nacquired, through natural selection, her inimitable architectural powers.\\n\\nBut this theory can be tested by experiment. Following the example of Mr.\\nTegetmeier, I separated two combs, and put between them a long, thick,\\nsquare strip of wax: the bees instantly began to excavate minute circular\\npits in it; and as they deepened these little pits, they made them wider\\nand wider until they were converted into shallow basins, appearing to the\\neye perfectly true or parts of a sphere, and of about the diameter of a\\ncell. It was most interesting to me to observe that wherever several bees\\nhad begun to excavate these basins near together, they had begun their work\\nat such a distance from each other, that by the time the basins had\\nacquired the above stated width (_i.e._ about the width of an ordinary\\ncell), and were in depth about one sixth of the diameter of the sphere of\\nwhich they formed a part, the rims of the basins intersected or broke into\\neach other. As soon as this occurred, the bees ceased to excavate, and\\nbegan to build up flat walls of wax on the lines of intersection between\\nthe basins, so that each hexagonal prism was built upon the scalloped edge\\nof a smooth basin, instead of on the straight edges of a three-sided\\npyramid as in the case of ordinary cells.\\n\\nI then put into the hive, instead of a thick, square piece of wax, a thin\\nand narrow, knife-edged ridge, coloured with vermilion. The bees instantly\\nbegan on both sides to excavate little basins near to each other, in the\\nsame way as before; but the ridge of wax was so thin, that the bottoms of\\nthe basins, if they had been excavated to the same depth as in the former\\n{229} experiment, would have broken into each other from the opposite\\nsides. The bees, however, did not suffer this to happen, and they stopped\\ntheir excavations in due time; so that the basins, as soon as they had been\\na little deepened, came to have flat bottoms; and these flat bottoms,\\nformed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax having been left\\nungnawed, were situated, as far as the eye could judge, exactly along the\\nplanes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite sides\\nof the ridge of wax. In parts, only little bits, in other parts, large\\nportions of a rhombic plate had been left between the opposed basins, but\\nthe work, from the unnatural state of things, had not been neatly\\nperformed. The bees must have worked at very nearly the same rate on the\\nopposite sides of the ridge of vermilion wax, as they circularly gnawed\\naway and deepened the basins on both sides, in order to have succeeded in\\nthus leaving flat plates between the basins, by stopping work along the\\nintermediate planes or planes of intersection.\\n\\nConsidering how flexible thin wax is, I do not see that there is any\\ndifficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip of wax,\\nperceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper thinness, and\\nthen stopping their work. In ordinary combs it has appeared to me that the\\nbees do not always succeed in working at exactly the same rate from the\\nopposite sides; for I have noticed half-completed rhombs at the base of a\\njust-commenced cell, which were slightly concave on one side, where I\\nsuppose that the bees had excavated too quickly, and convex on the opposed\\nside, where the bees had worked less quickly. In one well-marked instance,\\nI put the comb back into the hive, and allowed the bees to go on working\\nfor a short time, and again examined the cell, and I found that the rhombic\\n{230} plate had been completed, and had become _perfectly flat_: it was\\nabsolutely impossible, from the extreme thinness of the little rhombic\\nplate, that they could have effected this by gnawing away the convex side;\\nand I suspect that the bees in such cases stand in the opposed cells and\\npush and bend the ductile and warm wax (which as I have tried is easily\\ndone) into its proper intermediate plane, and thus flatten it.\\n\\nFrom the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax, we can clearly see that\\nif the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax, they could\\nmake their cells of the proper shape, by standing at the proper distance\\nfrom each other, by excavating at the same rate, and by endeavouring to\\nmake equal spherical hollows, but never allowing the spheres to break into\\neach other. Now bees, as may be clearly seen by examining the edge of a\\ngrowing comb, do make a rough, circumferential wall or rim all round the\\ncomb; and they gnaw into this from the opposite sides, always working\\ncircularly as they deepen each cell. They do not make the whole three-sided\\npyramidal base of any one cell at the same time, but only the one rhombic\\nplate which stands on the extreme growing margin, or the two plates, as the\\ncase may be; and they never complete the upper edges of the rhombic plates,\\nuntil the hexagonal walls are commenced. Some of these statements differ\\nfrom those made by the justly celebrated elder Huber, but I am convinced of\\ntheir accuracy; and if I had space, I could show that they are conformable\\nwith my theory.\\n\\nHuber\\'s statement that the very first cell is excavated out of a little\\nparallel-sided wall of wax, is not, as far as I have seen, strictly\\ncorrect; the first commencement having always been a little hood of wax;\\nbut I will not here enter on these details. We see how important {231} a\\npart excavation plays in the construction of the cells; but it would be a\\ngreat error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax in\\nthe proper position--that is, along the plane of intersection between two\\nadjoining spheres. I have several specimens showing clearly that they can\\ndo this. Even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax round a\\ngrowing comb, flexures may sometimes be observed, corresponding in position\\nto the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells. But the rough\\nwall of wax has in every case to be finished off, by being largely gnawed\\naway on both sides. The manner in which the bees build is curious; they\\nalways make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times thicker than the\\nexcessively thin finished wall of the cell, which will ultimately be left.\\nWe shall understand how they work, by supposing masons first to pile up a\\nbroad ridge of cement, and then to begin cutting it away equally on both\\nsides near the ground, till a smooth, very thin wall is left in the middle;\\nthe masons always piling up the cut-away cement, and adding fresh cement,\\non the summit of the ridge. We shall thus have a thin wall steadily growing\\nupward; but always crowned by a gigantic coping. From all the cells, both\\nthose just commenced and those completed, being thus crowned by a strong\\ncoping of wax, the bees can cluster and crawl over the comb without\\ninjuring the delicate hexagonal walls, which are only about one\\nfour-hundredth of an inch in thickness; the plates of the pyramidal basis\\nbeing about twice as thick. By this singular manner of building, strength\\nis continually given to the comb, with the utmost ultimate economy of wax.\\n\\nIt seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the cells\\nare made, that a multitude of bees all work together; one bee after working\\na short time at one cell going to another, so that, as Huber has stated,\\n{232} a score of individuals work even at the commencement of the first\\ncell. I was able practically to show this fact, by covering the edges of\\nthe hexagonal walls of a single cell, or the extreme margin of the\\ncircumferential rim of a growing comb, with an extremely thin layer of\\nmelted vermilion wax; and I invariably found that the colour was most\\ndelicately diffused by the bees--as delicately as a painter could have done\\nwith his brush--by atoms of the coloured wax having been taken from the\\nspot on which it had been placed, and worked into the growing edges of the\\ncells all round. The work of construction seems to be a sort of balance\\nstruck between many bees, all instinctively standing at the same relative\\ndistance from each other, all trying to sweep equal spheres, and then\\nbuilding up, or leaving ungnawed, the planes of intersection between these\\nspheres. It was really curious to note in cases of difficulty, as when two\\npieces of comb met at an angle, how often the bees would pull down and\\nrebuild in different ways the same cell, sometimes recurring to a shape\\nwhich they had at first rejected.\\n\\nWhen bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions\\nfor working,--for instance, on a slip of wood, placed directly under the\\nmiddle of a comb growing downwards so that the comb has to be built over\\none face of the slip--in this case the bees can lay the foundations of one\\nwall of a new hexagon, in its strictly proper place, projecting beyond the\\nother completed cells. It suffices that the bees should be enabled to stand\\nat their proper relative distances from each other and from the walls of\\nthe last completed cells, and then, by striking imaginary spheres, they can\\nbuild up a wall intermediate between two adjoining spheres; but, as far as\\nI have seen, they never gnaw away and finish off the angles of a cell till\\na large part both of that cell and of {233} the adjoining cells has been\\nbuilt. This capacity in bees of laying down under certain circumstances a\\nrough wall in its proper place between two just-commenced cells, is\\nimportant, as it bears on a fact, which seems at first quite subversive of\\nthe foregoing theory; namely, that the cells on the extreme margin of\\nwasp-combs are sometimes strictly hexagonal; but I have not space here to\\nenter on this subject. Nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a\\nsingle insect (as in the case of a queen-wasp) making hexagonal cells, if\\nshe work alternately on the inside and outside of two or three cells\\ncommenced at the same time, always standing at the proper relative distance\\nfrom the parts of the cells just begun, sweeping spheres or cylinders, and\\nbuilding up intermediate planes. It is even conceivable that an insect\\nmight, by fixing on a point at which to commence a cell, and then moving\\noutside, first to one point, and then to five other points, at the proper\\nrelative distances from the central point and from each other, strike the\\nplanes of intersection, and so make an isolated hexagon: but I am not aware\\nthat any such case has been observed; nor would any good be derived from a\\nsingle hexagon being built, as in its construction more materials would be\\nrequired than for a cylinder.\\n\\nAs natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight modifications\\nof structure or instinct, each profitable to the individual under its\\nconditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how a long and graduated\\nsuccession of modified architectural instincts, all tending towards the\\npresent perfect plan of construction, could have profited the progenitors\\nof the hive-bee? I think the answer is not difficult: it is known that bees\\nare often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar; and I am informed by Mr.\\nTegetmeier that it has been experimentally found that no less than from\\ntwelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar {234} are consumed by a hive of bees\\nfor the secretion of each pound of wax; to that a prodigious quantity of\\nfluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in a hive for the\\nsecretion of the wax necessary for the construction of their combs.\\nMoreover, many bees have to remain idle for many days during the process of\\nsecretion. A large store of honey is indispensable to support a large stock\\nof bees during the winter; and the security of the hive is known mainly to\\ndepend on a large number of bees being supported. Hence the saving of wax\\nby largely saving honey must be a most important element of success in any\\nfamily of bees. Of course the success of any species of bee may be\\ndependent on the number of its parasites or other enemies, or on quite\\ndistinct causes, and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey\\nwhich the bees could collect. But let us suppose that this latter\\ncircumstance determined, as it probably often does determine, the numbers\\nof a humble-bee which could exist in a country; and let us further suppose\\nthat the community lived throughout the winter, and consequently required a\\nstore of honey: there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an\\nadvantage to our humble-bee, if a slight modification of her instinct led\\nher to make her waxen cells near together, so as to intersect a little; for\\na wall in common even to two adjoining cells, would save some little wax.\\nHence it would continually be more and more advantageous to our humble-bee,\\nif she were to make her cells more and more regular, nearer together, and\\naggregated into a mass, like the cells of the Melipona; for in this case a\\nlarge part of the bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound other\\ncells, and much wax would be saved. Again, from the same cause, it would be\\nadvantageous to the Melipona, if she were to make her cells closer\\ntogether, and more regular in every way {235} than at present; for then, as\\nwe have seen, the spherical surfaces would wholly disappear, and would all\\nbe replaced by plane surfaces; and the Melipona would make a comb as\\nperfect as that of the hive-bee. Beyond this stage of perfection in\\narchitecture, natural selection could not lead; for the comb of the\\nhive-bee, as far as we can see, is absolutely perfect in economising wax.\\n\\nThus, as I believe, the most wonderful of all known instincts, that of the\\nhive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having taken advantage of\\nnumerous, successive, slight modifications of simpler instincts; natural\\nselection having by slow degrees, more and more perfectly, led the bees to\\nsweep equal spheres at a given distance from each other in a double layer,\\nand to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection. The\\nbees, of course, no more knowing that they swept their spheres at one\\nparticular distance from each other, than they know what are the several\\nangles of the hexagonal prisms and of the basal rhombic plates. The motive\\npower of the process of natural selection having been economy of wax; that\\nindividual swarm which wasted least honey in the secretion of wax, having\\nsucceeded best, and having transmitted by inheritance its newly acquired\\neconomical instinct to new swarms, which in their turn will have had the\\nbest chance of succeeding in the struggle for existence.\\n\\n\\n\\nNo doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed to\\nthe theory of natural selection,--cases, in which we cannot see how an\\ninstinct could possibly have originated; cases, in which no intermediate\\ngradations are known to exist; cases of instinct of apparently such\\ntrifling importance, that they could {236} hardly have been acted on by\\nnatural selection; cases of instincts almost identically the same in\\nanimals so remote in the scale of nature, that we cannot account for their\\nsimilarity by inheritance from a common parent, and must therefore believe\\nthat they have been acquired by independent acts of natural selection. I\\nwill not here enter on these several cases, but will confine myself to one\\nspecial difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually\\nfatal to my whole theory. I allude to the neuters or sterile females in\\ninsect-communities: for these neuters often differ widely in instinct and\\nin structure from both the males and fertile females, and yet, from being\\nsterile, they cannot propagate their kind.\\n\\nThe subject well deserves to be discussed at great length, but I will here\\ntake only a single case, that of working or sterile ants. How the workers\\nhave been rendered sterile is a difficulty; but not much greater than that\\nof any other striking modification of structure; for it can be shown that\\nsome insects and other articulate animals in a state of nature occasionally\\nbecome sterile; and if such insects had been social, and it had been\\nprofitable to the community that a number should have been annually born\\ncapable of work, but incapable of procreation, I can see no very great\\ndifficulty in this being effected by natural selection. But I must pass\\nover this preliminary difficulty. The great difficulty lies in the working\\nants differing widely from both the males and the fertile females in\\nstructure, as in the shape of the thorax and in being destitute of wings\\nand sometimes of eyes, and in instinct. As far as instinct alone is\\nconcerned, the prodigious difference in this respect between the workers\\nand the perfect females, would have been far better exemplified by the\\nhive-bee. If a working ant or other neuter insect had been an animal {237}\\nin the ordinary state, I should have unhesitatingly assumed that all its\\ncharacters had been slowly acquired through natural selection; namely, by\\nan individual having been born with some slight profitable modification of\\nstructure, this being inherited by its offspring, which again varied and\\nwere again selected, and so onwards. But with the working ant we have an\\ninsect differing greatly from its parents, yet absolutely sterile; so that\\nit could never have transmitted successively acquired modifications of\\nstructure or instinct to its progeny. It may well be asked how is it\\npossible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection?\\n\\nFirst, let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances, both in our\\ndomestic productions and in those in a state of nature, of all sorts of\\ndifferences of structure which have become correlated to certain ages, and\\nto either sex. We have differences correlated not only to one sex, but to\\nthat short period alone when the reproductive system is active, as in the\\nnuptial plumage of many birds, and in the hooked jaws of the male salmon.\\nWe have even slight differences in the horns of different breeds of cattle\\nin relation to an artificially imperfect state of the male sex; for oxen of\\ncertain breeds have longer horns than in other breeds, in comparison with\\nthe horns of the bulls or cows of these same breeds. Hence I can see no\\nreal difficulty in any character having become correlated with the sterile\\ncondition of certain members of insect-communities: the difficulty lies in\\nunderstanding how such correlated modifications of structure could have\\nbeen slowly accumulated by natural selection.\\n\\nThis difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as I\\nbelieve, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied to\\nthe family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the {238}\\ndesired end. Thus, a well-flavoured vegetable is cooked, and the individual\\nis destroyed; but the horticulturist sows seeds of the same stock, and\\nconfidently expects to get nearly the same variety: breeders of cattle wish\\nthe flesh and fat to be well marbled together; the animal has been\\nslaughtered, but the breeder goes with confidence to the same family. I\\nhave such faith in the powers of selection, that I do not doubt that a\\nbreed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns,\\ncould be slowly formed by carefully watching which individual bulls and\\ncows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest horns; and yet no one ox\\ncould ever have propagated its kind. Thus I believe it has been with social\\ninsects: a slight modification of structure, or instinct, correlated with\\nthe sterile condition of certain members of the community, has been\\nadvantageous to the community: consequently the fertile males and females\\nof the same community flourished, and transmitted to their fertile\\noffspring a tendency to produce sterile members having the same\\nmodification. And I believe that this process has been repeated, until that\\nprodigious amount of difference between the fertile and sterile females of\\nthe same species has been produced, which we see in many social insects.\\n\\nBut we have not as yet touched on the climax of the difficulty; namely, the\\nfact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only from the fertile\\nfemales and males, but from each other, sometimes to an almost incredible\\ndegree, and are thus divided into two or even three castes. The castes,\\nmoreover, do not generally graduate into each other, but are perfectly well\\ndefined; being as distinct from each other, as are any two species of the\\nsame genus, or rather as any two genera of the same family. Thus in Eciton,\\nthere are working and soldier neuters, with jaws and instincts\\nextraordinarily {239} different: in Cryptocerus, the workers of one caste\\nalone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads, the use of which is\\nquite unknown: in the Mexican Myrmecocystus, the workers of one caste never\\nleave the nest; they are fed by the workers of another caste, and they have\\nan enormously developed abdomen which secretes a sort of honey, supplying\\nthe place of that excreted by the aphides, or the domestic cattle as they\\nmay be called, which our European ants guard or imprison.\\n\\nIt will indeed be thought that I have an overweening confidence in the\\nprinciple of natural selection, when I do not admit that such wonderful and\\nwell-established facts at once annihilate my theory. In the simpler case of\\nneuter insects all of one caste or of the same kind, which have been\\nrendered by natural selection, as I believe to be quite possible, different\\nfrom the fertile males and females,--in this case, we may safely conclude\\nfrom the analogy of ordinary variations, that each successive, slight,\\nprofitable modification did not probably at first appear in all the\\nindividual neuters in the same nest, but in a few alone; and that by the\\nlong-continued selection of the fertile parents which produced most neuters\\nwith the profitable modification, all the neuters ultimately came to have\\nthe desired character. On this view we ought occasionally to find\\nneuter-insects of the same species, in the same nest, presenting gradations\\nof structure; and this we do find, even often, considering how few\\nneuter-insects out of Europe have been carefully examined. Mr. F. Smith has\\nshown how surprisingly the neuters of several British ants differ from each\\nother in size and sometimes in colour; and that the extreme forms can\\nsometimes be perfectly linked together by individuals taken out of the same\\nnest: I have myself compared perfect gradations of this kind. It often\\nhappens that the larger or the smaller sized workers {240} are the most\\nnumerous; or that both large and small are numerous, with those of an\\nintermediate size scanty in numbers. Formica flava has larger and smaller\\nworkers, with some of intermediate size; and, in this species, as Mr. F.\\nSmith has observed, the larger workers have simple eyes (ocelli), which\\nthough small can be plainly distinguished, whereas the smaller workers have\\ntheir ocelli rudimentary. Having carefully dissected several specimens of\\nthese workers, I can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the\\nsmaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionally\\nlesser size; and I fully believe, though I dare not assert so positively,\\nthat the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly\\nintermediate condition. So that we here have two bodies of sterile workers\\nin the same nest, differing not only in size, but in their organs of\\nvision, yet connected by some few members in an intermediate condition. I\\nmay digress by adding, that if the smaller workers had been the most useful\\nto the community, and those males and females had been continually\\nselected, which produced more and more of the smaller workers, until all\\nthe workers had come to be in this condition; we should then have had a\\nspecies of ant with neuters very nearly in the same condition with those of\\nMyrmica. For the workers of Myrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli,\\nthough the male and female ants of this genus have well-developed ocelli.\\n\\nI may give one other case: so confidently did I expect to find gradations\\nin important points of structure between the different castes of neuters in\\nthe same species, that I gladly availed myself of Mr. F. Smith\\'s offer of\\nnumerous specimens from the same nest of the driver ant (Anomma) of West\\nAfrica. The reader will perhaps best appreciate the amount of difference in\\nthese {241} workers, by my giving not the actual measurements, but a\\nstrictly accurate illustration: the difference was the same as if we were\\nto see a set of workmen building a house of whom many were five feet four\\ninches high, and many sixteen feet high; but we must suppose that the\\nlarger workmen had heads four instead of three times as big as those of the\\nsmaller men, and jaws nearly five times as big. The jaws, moreover, of the\\nworking ants of the several sizes differed wonderfully in shape, and in the\\nform and number of the teeth. But the important fact for us is, that though\\nthe workers can be grouped into castes of different sizes, yet they\\ngraduate insensibly into each other, as does the widely-different structure\\nof their jaws. I speak confidently on this latter point, as Mr. Lubbock\\nmade drawings for me with the camera lucida of the jaws which I had\\ndissected from the workers of the several sizes.\\n\\nWith these facts before me, I believe that natural selection, by acting on\\nthe fertile parents, could form a species which should regularly produce\\nneuters, either all of large size with one form of jaw, or all of small\\nsize with jaws having a widely different structure; or lastly, and this is\\nour climax of difficulty, one set of workers of one size and structure, and\\nsimultaneously another set of workers of a different size and structure;--a\\ngraduated series having been first formed, as in the case of the driver\\nant, and then the extreme forms, from being the most useful to the\\ncommunity, having been produced in greater and greater numbers through the\\nnatural selection of the parents which generated them; until none with an\\nintermediate structure were produced.\\n\\nThus, as I believe, the wonderful fact of two distinctly defined castes of\\nsterile workers existing in the same nest, both widely different from each\\nother and from {242} their parents, has originated. We can see how useful\\ntheir production may have been to a social community of insects, on the\\nsame principle that the division of labour is useful to civilised man. As\\nants work by inherited instincts and by inherited organs or tools, and not\\nby acquired knowledge and manufactured instruments, a perfect division of\\nlabour could be effected with them only by the workers being sterile; for\\nhad they been fertile, they would have intercrossed, and their instincts\\nand structure would have become blended. And nature has, as I believe,\\neffected this admirable division of labour in the communities of ants, by\\nthe means of natural selection. But I am bound to confess, that, with all\\nmy faith in this principle, I should never have anticipated that natural\\nselection could have been efficient in so high a degree, had not the case\\nof these neuter insects convinced me of the fact. I have, therefore,\\ndiscussed this case, at some little but wholly insufficient length, in\\norder to show the power of natural selection, and likewise because this is\\nby far the most serious special difficulty, which my theory has\\nencountered. The case, also, is very interesting, as it proves that with\\nanimals, as with plants, any amount of modification in structure can be\\neffected by the accumulation of numerous, slight, and as we must call them\\naccidental, variations, which are in any manner profitable, without\\nexercise or habit having come into play. For no amount of exercise, or\\nhabit, or volition, in the utterly sterile members of a community could\\npossibly affect the structure or instincts of the fertile members, which\\nalone leave descendants. I am surprised that no one has advanced this\\ndemonstrative case of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of\\nLamarck.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Summary._--I have endeavoured briefly in this chapter {243} to show that\\nthe mental qualities of our domestic animals vary, and that the variations\\nare inherited. Still more briefly I have attempted to show that instincts\\nvary slightly in a state of nature. No one will dispute that instincts are\\nof the highest importance to each animal. Therefore I can see no\\ndifficulty, under changing conditions of life, in natural selection\\naccumulating slight modifications of instinct to any extent, in any useful\\ndirection. In some cases habit or use and disuse have probably come into\\nplay. I do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter strengthen in\\nany great degree my theory; but none of the cases of difficulty, to the\\nbest of my judgment, annihilate it. On the other hand, the fact that\\ninstincts are not always absolutely perfect and are liable to\\nmistakes;--that no instinct has been produced for the exclusive good of\\nother animals, but that each animal takes advantage of the instincts of\\nothers;--that the canon in natural history, of \"Natura non facit saltum,\"\\nis applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal structure, and is\\nplainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is otherwise\\ninexplicable,--all tend to corroborate the theory of natural selection.\\n\\nThis theory is, also, strengthened by some few other facts in regard to\\ninstincts; as by that common case of closely allied, but certainly\\ndistinct, species, when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living\\nunder considerably different conditions of life, yet often retaining nearly\\nthe same instincts. For instance, we can understand on the principle of\\ninheritance, how it is that the thrush of South America lines its nest with\\nmud, in the same peculiar manner as does our British thrush: how it is that\\nthe male wrens (Troglodytes) of North America, build \"cock-nests,\" to roost\\nin, like the males of our distinct Kitty-wrens,--a habit wholly unlike that\\nof {244} any other known bird. Finally, it may not be a logical deduction,\\nbut to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts\\nas the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers,--ants making slaves,--the\\nlarvae of ichneumonidГ¦ feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars,--not\\nas specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one\\ngeneral law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely,\\nmultiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{245}\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nHYBRIDISM.\\n\\n    Distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of\\n    hybrids--Sterility various in degree, not universal, affected by close\\n    interbreeding, removed by domestication--Laws governing the sterility\\n    of hybrids--Sterility not a special endowment, but incidental on other\\n    differences--Causes of the sterility of first crosses and of\\n    hybrids--Parallelism between the effects of changed conditions of life\\n    and crossing--Fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel\\n    offspring not universal--Hybrids and mongrels compared independently of\\n    their fertility--Summary.\\n\\nThe view generally entertained by naturalists is that species, when\\nintercrossed, have been specially endowed with the quality of sterility, in\\norder to prevent the confusion of all organic forms. This view certainly\\nseems at first probable, for species within the same country could hardly\\nhave kept distinct had they been capable of crossing freely. The importance\\nof the fact that hybrids are very generally sterile, has, I think, been\\nmuch underrated by some late writers. On the theory of natural selection\\nthe case is especially important, inasmuch as the sterility of hybrids\\ncould not possibly be of any advantage to them, and therefore could not\\nhave been acquired by the continued preservation of successive profitable\\ndegrees of sterility. I hope, however, to be able to show that sterility is\\nnot a specially acquired or endowed quality, but is incidental on other\\nacquired differences.\\n\\nIn treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large extent\\nfundamentally different, have generally been confounded together; namely,\\nthe sterility of two species {246} when first crossed, and the sterility of\\nthe hybrids produced from them.\\n\\nPure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect\\ncondition, yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no offspring.\\nHybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive organs functionally\\nimpotent, as may be clearly seen in the state of the male element in both\\nplants and animals; though the organs themselves are perfect in structure,\\nas far as the microscope reveals. In the first case the two sexual elements\\nwhich go to form the embryo are perfect; in the second case they are either\\nnot at all developed, or are imperfectly developed. This distinction is\\nimportant, when the cause of the sterility, which is common to the two\\ncases, has to be considered. The distinction has probably been slurred\\nover, owing to the sterility in both cases being looked on as a special\\nendowment, beyond the province of our reasoning powers.\\n\\nThe fertility of varieties, that is of the forms known or believed to have\\ndescended from common parents, when intercrossed, and likewise the\\nfertility of their mongrel offspring, is, on my theory, of equal importance\\nwith the sterility of species; for it seems to make a broad and clear\\ndistinction between varieties and species.\\n\\nFirst, for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid\\noffspring. It is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of those\\ntwo conscientious and admirable observers, KГ¶lreuter and GГ¤rtner, who\\nalmost devoted their lives to this subject, without being deeply impressed\\nwith the high generality of some degree of sterility. KГ¶lreuter makes the\\nrule universal; but then he cuts the knot, for in ten cases in which he\\nfound two forms, considered by most authors as distinct species, quite\\nfertile together, he unhesitatingly ranks {247} them as varieties. GГ¤rtner,\\nalso, makes the rule equally universal; and he disputes the entire\\nfertility of KГ¶lreuter\\'s ten cases. But in these and in many other cases,\\nGГ¤rtner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in order to show that\\nthere is any degree of sterility. He always compares the maximum number of\\nseeds produced by two species when crossed and by their hybrid offspring,\\nwith the average number produced by both pure parent-species in a state of\\nnature. But a serious cause of error seems to me to be here introduced: a\\nplant to be hybridised must be castrated, and, what is often more\\nimportant, must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being brought to it\\nby insects from other plants. Nearly all the plants experimentised on by\\nGГ¤rtner were potted, and apparently were kept in a chamber in his house.\\nThat these processes are often injurious to the fertility of a plant cannot\\nbe doubted; for GГ¤rtner gives in his table about a score of cases of plants\\nwhich he castrated, and artificially fertilised with their own pollen, and\\n(excluding all cases such as the LeguminosГ¦, in which there is an\\nacknowledged difficulty in the manipulation) half of these twenty plants\\nhad their fertility in some degree impaired. Moreover, as GГ¤rtner during\\nseveral years repeatedly crossed the primrose and cowslip, which we have\\nsuch good reason to believe to be varieties, and only once or twice\\nsucceeded in getting fertile seed; as he found the common red and blue\\npimpernels (Anagallis arvensis and coerulea), which the best botanists rank\\nas varieties, absolutely sterile together; and as he came to the same\\nconclusion in several other analogous cases; it seems to me that we may\\nwell be permitted to doubt whether many other species are really so\\nsterile, when intercrossed, as GГ¤rtner believes. {248}\\n\\nIt is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various species when\\ncrossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly, and, on\\nthe other hand, that the fertility of pure species is so easily affected by\\nvarious circumstances, that for all practical purposes it is most difficult\\nto say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins. I think no better\\nevidence of this can be required than that the two most experienced\\nobservers who have ever lived, namely, KГ¶lreuter and GГ¤rtner, should have\\narrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to the very same\\nspecies. It is also most instructive to compare--but I have not space here\\nto enter on details--the evidence advanced by our best botanists on the\\nquestion whether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or\\nvarieties, with the evidence from fertility adduced by different\\nhybridisers, or by the same author, from experiments made during different\\nyears. It can thus be shown that neither sterility nor fertility affords\\nany clear distinction between species and varieties; but that the evidence\\nfrom this source graduates away, and is doubtful in the same degree as is\\nthe evidence derived from other constitutional and structural differences.\\n\\nIn regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations; though\\nGГ¤rtner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding them from a\\ncross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in one case for ten\\ngenerations, yet he asserts positively that their fertility never\\nincreased, but generally greatly decreased. I do not doubt that this is\\nusually the case, and that the fertility often suddenly decreases in the\\nfirst few generations. Nevertheless I believe that in all these experiments\\nthe fertility has been diminished by an independent cause, namely, from\\nclose interbreeding. I have collected so large a body of facts, showing\\n{249} that close interbreeding lessens fertility, and, on the other hand,\\nthat an occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases\\nfertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this almost universal\\nbelief amongst breeders. Hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in\\ngreat numbers; and as the parent-species, or other allied hybrids,\\ngenerally grow in the same garden, the visits of insects must be carefully\\nprevented during the flowering season: hence hybrids will generally be\\nfertilised during each generation by their own individual pollen; and I am\\nconvinced that this would be injurious to their fertility, already lessened\\nby their hybrid origin. I am strengthened in this conviction by a\\nremarkable statement repeatedly made by GГ¤rtner, namely, that if even the\\nless fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the\\nsame kind, their fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill effects of\\nmanipulation, sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on increasing. Now,\\nin artificial fertilisation pollen is as often taken by chance (as I know\\nfrom my own experience) from the anthers of another flower, as from the\\nanthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised; so that a cross\\nbetween two flowers, though probably on the same plant, would be thus\\neffected. Moreover, whenever complicated experiments are in progress, so\\ncareful an observer as GГ¤rtner would have castrated his hybrids, and this\\nwould have insured in each generation a cross with a pollen from a distinct\\nflower, either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid\\nnature. And thus, the strange fact of the increase of fertility in the\\nsuccessive generations of _artificially fertilised_ hybrids may, I believe,\\nbe accounted for by close interbreeding having been avoided.\\n\\nNow let us turn to the results arrived at by the third most experienced\\nhybridiser, namely, the Hon. and {250} Rev. W. Herbert. He is as emphatic\\nin his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile--as fertile as\\nthe pure parent-species--as are KГ¶lreuter and GГ¤rtner that some degree of\\nsterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature. He\\nexperimentised on some of the very same species as did GГ¤rtner. The\\ndifference in their results may, I think, be in part accounted for by\\nHerbert\\'s great horticultural skill, and by his having hothouses at his\\ncommand. Of his many important statements I will here give only a single\\none as an example, namely, that \"every ovule in a pod of Crinum capense\\nfertilised by C. revolutum produced a plant, which (he says) I never saw to\\noccur in a case of its natural fecundation.\" So that we here have perfect,\\nor even more than commonly perfect, fertility in a first cross between two\\ndistinct species.\\n\\nThis case of the Crinum leads me to refer to a most singular fact, namely,\\nthat there are individual plants of certain species of Lobelia and of some\\nother genera, which can be far more easily fertilised by the pollen of\\nanother and distinct species, than by their own pollen; and all the\\nindividuals of nearly all the species of Hippeastrum seem to be in this\\npredicament. For these plants have been found to yield seed to the pollen\\nof a distinct species, though quite sterile with their own pollen,\\nnotwithstanding that their own pollen was found to be perfectly good, for\\nit fertilised distinct species. So that certain individual plants and all\\nthe individuals of certain species can actually be hybridised much more\\nreadily than they can be self-fertilised! For instance, a bulb of\\nHippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers; three were fertilised by Herbert\\nwith their own pollen, and the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the\\npollen of a compound hybrid descended from three other and distinct {251}\\nspecies: the result was that \"the ovaries of the three first flowers soon\\nceased to grow, and after a few days perished entirely, whereas the pod\\nimpregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid\\nprogress to maturity, and bore good seed, which vegetated freely.\" In a\\nletter to me, in 1839, Mr. Herbert told me that he had then tried the\\nexperiment during five years, and he continued to try it during several\\nsubsequent years, and always with the same result. This result has, also,\\nbeen confirmed by other observers in the case of Hippeastrum with its\\nsub-genera, and in the case of some other genera, as Lobelia, Passiflora\\nand Verbascum. Although the plants in these experiments appeared perfectly\\nhealthy, and although both the ovules and pollen of the same flower were\\nperfectly good with respect to other species, yet as they were functionally\\nimperfect in their mutual self-action, we must infer that the plants were\\nin an unnatural state. Nevertheless these facts show on what slight and\\nmysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of species when crossed,\\nin comparison with the same species when self-fertilised, sometimes\\ndepends.\\n\\nThe practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with\\nscientific precision, deserve some notice. It is notorious in how\\ncomplicated a manner the species of Pelargonium, Fuchsia, Calceolaria,\\nPetunia, Rhododendron, &c., have been crossed, yet many of these hybrids\\nseed freely. For instance, Herbert asserts that a hybrid from Calceolaria\\nintegrifolia and plantaginea, species most widely dissimilar in general\\nhabit, \"reproduced itself as perfectly as if it had been a natural species\\nfrom the mountains of Chile.\" I have taken some pains to ascertain the\\ndegree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of Rhododendrons, and I\\nam assured that many of them {252} are perfectly fertile. Mr. C. Noble, for\\ninstance, informs me that he raises stocks for grafting from a hybrid\\nbetween Rhod. Ponticum and Catawbiense, and that this hybrid \"seeds as\\nfreely as it is possible to imagine.\" Had hybrids, when fairly treated,\\ngone on decreasing in fertility in each successive generation, as GГ¤rtner\\nbelieves to be the case, the fact would have been notorious to nurserymen.\\nHorticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrids, and such alone are\\nfairly treated, for by insect agency the several individuals of the same\\nhybrid variety are allowed to freely cross with each other, and the\\ninjurious influence of close interbreeding is thus prevented. Any one may\\nreadily convince himself of the efficiency of insect-agency by examining\\nthe flowers of the more sterile kinds of hybrid rhododendrons, which\\nproduce no pollen, for he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen\\nbrought from other flowers.\\n\\nIn regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been carefully tried than\\nwith plants. If our systematic arrangements can be trusted, that is if the\\ngenera of animals are as distinct from each other, as are the genera of\\nplants, then we may infer that animals more widely separated in the scale\\nof nature can be more easily crossed than in the case of plants; but the\\nhybrids themselves are, I think, more sterile. I doubt whether any case of\\na perfectly fertile hybrid animal can be considered as thoroughly well\\nauthenticated. It should, however, be borne in mind that, owing to few\\nanimals breeding freely under confinement, few experiments have been fairly\\ntried: for instance, the canary-bird has been crossed with nine other\\nfinches, but as not one of these nine species breeds freely in confinement,\\nwe have no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the\\ncanary, or that their hybrids, {253} should be perfectly fertile. Again,\\nwith respect to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile\\nhybrid animals, I hardly know of an instance in which two families of the\\nsame hybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents, so as\\nto avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding. On the contrary, brothers\\nand sisters have usually been crossed in each successive generation, in\\nopposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every breeder. And in\\nthis case, it is not at all surprising that the inherent sterility in the\\nhybrids should have gone on increasing. If we were to act thus, and pair\\nbrothers and sisters in the case of any pure animal, which from any cause\\nhad the least tendency to sterility, the breed would assuredly be lost in a\\nvery few generations.\\n\\nAlthough I do not know of any thoroughly well-authenticated cases of\\nperfectly fertile hybrid animals, I have some reason to believe that the\\nhybrids from Cervulus vaginalis and Reevesii, and from Phasianus colchicus\\nwith P. torquatus and with P. versicolor are perfectly fertile. There is no\\ndoubt that these three pheasants, namely, the common, the true ring-necked,\\nand the Japan, intercross, and are becoming blended together in the woods\\nof several parts of England. The hybrids from the common and Chinese geese\\n(A. cygnoides), species which are so different that they are generally\\nranked in distinct genera, have often bred in this country with either pure\\nparent, and in one single instance they have bred _inter se_. This was\\neffected by Mr. Eyton, who raised two hybrids from the same parents but\\nfrom different hatches; and from these two birds he raised no less than\\neight hybrids (grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest. In India,\\nhowever, these cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for I am assured\\nby two eminently capable judges, namely {254} Mr. Blyth and Capt. Hutton,\\nthat whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of the\\ncountry; and as they are kept for profit, where neither pure parent-species\\nexists, they must certainly be highly fertile.\\n\\nA doctrine which originated with Pallas, has been largely accepted by\\nmodern naturalists; namely, that most of our domestic animals have\\ndescended from two or more wild species, since commingled by intercrossing.\\nOn this view, the aboriginal species must either at first have produced\\nquite fertile hybrids, or the hybrids must have become in subsequent\\ngenerations quite fertile under domestication. This latter alternative\\nseems to me the most probable, and I am inclined to believe in its truth,\\nalthough it rests on no direct evidence. I believe, for instance, that our\\ndogs have descended from several wild stocks; yet, with perhaps the\\nexception of certain indigenous domestic dogs of South America, all are\\nquite fertile together; and analogy makes me greatly doubt, whether the\\nseveral aboriginal species would at first have freely bred together and\\nhave produced quite fertile hybrids. So again there is reason to believe\\nthat our European and the humped Indian cattle are quite fertile together;\\nbut from facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth, I think they must be\\nconsidered as distinct species. On this view of the origin of many of our\\ndomestic animals, we must either give up the belief of the almost universal\\nsterility of distinct species of animals when crossed; or we must look at\\nsterility, not as an indelible characteristic, but as one capable of being\\nremoved by domestication.\\n\\nFinally, looking to all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of\\nplants and animals, it may be concluded that some degree of sterility, both\\nin first crosses {255} and in hybrids, is an extremely general result; but\\nthat it cannot, under our present state of knowledge, be considered as\\nabsolutely universal.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Laws governing the Sterility of first Crosses and of Hybrids._--We will\\nnow consider a little more in detail the circumstances and rules governing\\nthe sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. Our chief object will be to\\nsee whether or not the rules indicate that species have specially been\\nendowed with this quality, in order to prevent their crossing and blending\\ntogether in utter confusion. The following rules and conclusions are\\nchiefly drawn up from GГ¤rtner\\'s admirable work on the hybridisation of\\nplants. I have taken much pains to ascertain how far the rules apply to\\nanimals, and considering how scanty our knowledge is in regard to hybrid\\nanimals, I have been surprised to find how generally the same rules apply\\nto both kingdoms.\\n\\nIt has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both of first\\ncrosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect fertility. It is\\nsurprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown to exist;\\nbut only the barest outline of the facts can here be given. When pollen\\nfrom a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a distinct\\nfamily, it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic dust. From this\\nabsolute zero of fertility, the pollen of different species of the same\\ngenus applied to the stigma of some one species, yields a perfect gradation\\nin the number of seeds produced, up to nearly complete or even quite\\ncomplete fertility; and, as we have seen, in certain abnormal cases, even\\nto an excess of fertility, beyond that which the plant\\'s own pollen will\\nproduce. So in hybrids themselves, there are some which never have\\nproduced, and probably never would produce, even {256} with the pollen of\\neither pure parent, a single fertile seed: but in some of these cases a\\nfirst trace of fertility may be detected, by the pollen of one of the pure\\nparent-species causing the flower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it\\notherwise would have done; and the early withering of the flower is well\\nknown to be a sign of incipient fertilisation. From this extreme degree of\\nsterility we have self-fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater\\nnumber of seeds up to perfect fertility.\\n\\nHybrids from two species which are very difficult to cross, and which\\nrarely produce any offspring, are generally very sterile; but the\\nparallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross, and the\\nsterility of the hybrids thus produced--two classes of facts which are\\ngenerally confounded together--is by no means strict. There are many cases,\\nin which two pure species can be united with unusual facility, and produce\\nnumerous hybrid-offspring, yet these hybrids are remarkably sterile. On the\\nother hand, there are species which can be crossed very rarely, or with\\nextreme difficulty, but the hybrids, when at last produced, are very\\nfertile. Even within the limits of the same genus, for instance in\\nDianthus, these two opposite cases occur.\\n\\nThe fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is more easily\\naffected by unfavourable conditions, than is the fertility of pure species.\\nBut the degree of fertility is likewise innately variable; for it is not\\nalways the same when the same two species are crossed under the same\\ncircumstances, but depends in part upon the constitution of the individuals\\nwhich happen to have been chosen for the experiment. So it is with hybrids,\\nfor their degree of fertility is often found to differ greatly in the\\nseveral individuals raised from seed out of the same capsule and exposed to\\nexactly the same conditions. {257}\\n\\nBy the term systematic affinity is meant, the resemblance between species\\nin structure and in constitution, more especially in the structure of parts\\nwhich are of high physiological importance and which differ little in the\\nallied species. Now the fertility of first crosses between species, and of\\nthe hybrids produced from them, is largely governed by their systematic\\naffinity. This is clearly shown by hybrids never having been raised between\\nspecies ranked by systematists in distinct families; and on the other hand,\\nby very closely allied species generally uniting with facility. But the\\ncorrespondence between systematic affinity and the facility of crossing is\\nby no means strict. A multitude of cases could be given of very closely\\nallied species which will not unite, or only with extreme difficulty; and\\non the other hand of very distinct species which unite with the utmost\\nfacility. In the same family there may be a genus, as Dianthus, in which\\nvery many species can most readily be crossed; and another genus, as\\nSilene, in which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce\\nbetween extremely close species a single hybrid. Even within the limits of\\nthe same genus, we meet with this same difference; for instance, the many\\nspecies of Nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of\\nalmost any other genus; but GГ¤rtner found that N. acuminata, which is not a\\nparticularly distinct species, obstinately failed to fertilise, or to be\\nfertilised by, no less than eight other species of Nicotiana. Very many\\nanalogous facts could be given.\\n\\nNo one has been able to point out what kind, or what amount, of difference\\nin any recognisable character is sufficient to prevent two species\\ncrossing. It can be shown that plants most widely different in habit and\\ngeneral appearance, and having strongly marked {258} differences in every\\npart of the flower, even in the pollen, in the fruit, and in the\\ncotyledons, can be crossed. Annual and perennial plants, deciduous and\\nevergreen trees, plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for\\nextremely different climates, can often be crossed with ease.\\n\\nBy a reciprocal cross between two species, I mean the case, for instance,\\nof a stallion-horse being first crossed with a female-ass, and then a\\nmale-ass with a mare: these two species may then be said to have been\\nreciprocally crossed. There is often the widest possible difference in the\\nfacility of making reciprocal crosses. Such cases are highly important, for\\nthey prove that the capacity in any two species to cross is often\\ncompletely independent of their systematic affinity, or of any recognisable\\ndifference in their whole organisation. On the other hand, these cases\\nclearly show that the capacity for crossing is connected with\\nconstitutional differences imperceptible by us, and confined to the\\nreproductive system. This difference in the result of reciprocal crosses\\nbetween the same two species was long ago observed by KГ¶lreuter. To give an\\ninstance: Mirabilis jalapa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of M.\\nlongiflora, and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile; but\\nKГ¶lreuter tried more than two hundred times, during eight following years,\\nto fertilise reciprocally M. longiflora with the pollen of M. jalapa, and\\nutterly failed. Several other equally striking cases could be given. Thuret\\nhas observed the same fact with certain sea-weeds or Fuci. GГ¤rtner,\\nmoreover, found that this difference of facility in making reciprocal\\ncrosses is extremely common in a lesser degree. He has observed it even\\nbetween forms so closely related (as Matthiola annua and glabra) that many\\nbotanists rank them only as varieties. It is also a remarkable fact, that\\nhybrids raised from reciprocal crosses, though {259} of course compounded\\nof the very same two species, the one species having first been used as the\\nfather and then as the mother, generally differ in fertility in a small,\\nand occasionally in a high degree.\\n\\nSeveral other singular rules could be given from GГ¤rtner: for instance,\\nsome species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species; other\\nspecies of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing their\\nlikeness on their hybrid offspring; but these two powers do not at all\\nnecessarily go together. There are certain hybrids which instead of having,\\nas is usual, an intermediate character between their two parents, always\\nclosely resemble one of them; and such hybrids, though externally so like\\none of their pure parent-species, are with rare exceptions extremely\\nsterile. So again amongst hybrids which are usually intermediate in\\nstructure between their parents, exceptional and abnormal individuals\\nsometimes are born, which closely resemble one of their pure parents; and\\nthese hybrids are almost always utterly sterile, even when the other\\nhybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have a considerable degree\\nof fertility. These facts show how completely fertility in the hybrid is\\nindependent of its external resemblance to either pure parent.\\n\\nConsidering the several rules now given, which govern the fertility of\\nfirst crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms, which must be\\nconsidered as good and distinct species, are united, their fertility\\ngraduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to fertility under\\ncertain conditions in excess. That their fertility, besides being eminently\\nsusceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions, is innately\\nvariable. That it is by no means always the same in degree in the first\\ncross and in the hybrids produced {260} from this cross. That the fertility\\nof hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble in external\\nappearance either parent. And lastly, that the facility of making a first\\ncross between any two species is not always governed by their systematic\\naffinity or degree of resemblance to each other. This latter statement is\\nclearly proved by reciprocal crosses between the same two species, for\\naccording as the one species or the other is used as the father or the\\nmother, there is generally some difference, and occasionally the widest\\npossible difference, in the facility of effecting an union. The hybrids,\\nmoreover, produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility.\\n\\nNow do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been\\nendowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded in\\nnature? I think not. For why should the sterility be so extremely different\\nin degree, when various species are crossed, all of which we must suppose\\nit would be equally important to keep from blending together? Why should\\nthe degree of sterility be innately variable in the individuals of the same\\nspecies? Why should some species cross with facility, and yet produce very\\nsterile hybrids; and other species cross with extreme difficulty, and yet\\nproduce fairly fertile hybrids? Why should there often be so great a\\ndifference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two\\nspecies? Why, it may even be asked, has the production of hybrids been\\npermitted? to grant to species the special power of producing hybrids, and\\nthen to stop their further propagation by different degrees of sterility,\\nnot strictly related to the facility of the first union between their\\nparents, seems to be a strange arrangement.\\n\\nThe foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, {261} appear to me\\nclearly to indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of hybrids\\nis simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences, chiefly in the\\nreproductive systems, of the species which are crossed. The differences\\nbeing of so peculiar and limited a nature, that, in reciprocal crosses\\nbetween two species the male sexual element of the one will often freely\\nact on the female sexual element of the other, but not in a reversed\\ndirection. It will be advisable to explain a little more fully by an\\nexample what I mean by sterility being incidental on other differences, and\\nnot a specially endowed quality. As the capacity of one plant to be grafted\\nor budded on another is so entirely unimportant for its welfare in a state\\nof nature, I presume that no one will suppose that this capacity is a\\n_specially_ endowed quality, but will admit that it is incidental on\\ndifferences in the laws of growth of the two plants. We can sometimes see\\nthe reason why one tree will not take on another, from differences in their\\nrate of growth, in the hardness of their wood, in the period of the flow or\\nnature of their sap, &c.; but in a multitude of cases we can assign no\\nreason whatever. Great diversity in the size of two plants, one being woody\\nand the other herbaceous, one being evergreen and the other deciduous, and\\nadaptation to widely different climates, does not always prevent the two\\ngrafting together. As in hybridisation, so with grafting, the capacity is\\nlimited by systematic affinity, for no one has been able to graft trees\\ntogether belonging to quite distinct families; and, on the other hand,\\nclosely allied species, and varieties of the same species, can usually, but\\nnot invariably, be grafted with ease. But this capacity, as in\\nhybridisation, is by no means absolutely governed by systematic affinity.\\nAlthough many distinct genera within the same family have been grafted\\n{262} together, in other cases species of the same genus will not take on\\neach other. The pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince, which\\nis ranked as a distinct genus, than on the apple, which is a member of the\\nsame genus. Even different varieties of the pear take with different\\ndegrees of facility on the quince; so do different varieties of the apricot\\nand peach on certain varieties of the plum.\\n\\nAs GГ¤rtner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in different\\n_individuals_ of the same two species in crossing; so Sagaret believes this\\nto be the case with different individuals of the same two species in being\\ngrafted together. As in reciprocal crosses, the facility of effecting an\\nunion is often very far from equal, so it sometimes is in grafting; the\\ncommon gooseberry, for instance, cannot be grafted on the currant, whereas\\nthe currant will take, though with difficulty, on the gooseberry.\\n\\nWe have seen that the sterility of hybrids, which have their reproductive\\norgans in an imperfect condition, is a very different case from the\\ndifficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their reproductive\\norgans perfect; yet these two distinct cases run to a certain extent\\nparallel. Something analogous occurs in grafting; for Thouin found that\\nthree species of Robinia, which seeded freely on their own roots, and which\\ncould be grafted with no great difficulty on another species, when thus\\ngrafted were rendered barren. On the other hand, certain species of Sorbus,\\nwhen grafted on other species, yielded twice as much fruit as when on their\\nown roots. We are reminded by this latter fact of the extraordinary case of\\nHippeastrum, Lobelia, &c, which seeded much more freely when fertilised\\nwith the pollen of distinct species, than when self-fertilised with their\\nown pollen. {263}\\n\\nWe thus see, that although there is a clear and fundamental difference\\nbetween the mere adhesion of grafted stocks, and the union of the male and\\nfemale elements in the act of reproduction, yet that there is a rude degree\\nof parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing distinct species.\\nAnd as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the facility\\nwith which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on unknown\\ndifferences in their vegetative systems, so I believe that the still more\\ncomplex laws governing the facility of first crosses, are incidental on\\nunknown differences, chiefly in their reproductive systems. These\\ndifferences, in both cases, follow to a certain extent, as might have been\\nexpected, systematic affinity, by which every kind of resemblance and\\ndissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be expressed. The\\nfacts by no means seem to me to indicate that the greater or lesser\\ndifficulty of either grafting or crossing together various species has been\\na special endowment; although in the case of crossing, the difficulty is as\\nimportant for the endurance and stability of specific forms, as in the case\\nof grafting it is unimportant for their welfare.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Causes of the Sterility of first Crosses and of Hybrids._--We may now look\\na little closer at the probable causes of the sterility of first crosses\\nand of hybrids. These two cases are fundamentally different, for, as just\\nremarked, in the union of two pure species the male and female sexual\\nelements are perfect, whereas in hybrids they are imperfect. Even in first\\ncrosses, the greater or lesser difficulty in effecting a union apparently\\ndepends on several distinct causes. There must sometimes be a physical\\nimpossibility in the male element reaching the ovule, as would be the case\\nwith a plant {264} having a pistil too long for the pollen-tubes to reach\\nthe ovarium. It has also been observed that when pollen of one species is\\nplaced on the stigma of a distantly allied species, though the pollen-tubes\\nprotrude, they do not penetrate the stigmatic surface. Again, the male\\nelement may reach the female element, but be incapable of causing an embryo\\nto be developed, as seems to have been the case with some of Thuret\\'s\\nexperiments on Fuci. No explanation can be given of these facts, any more\\nthan why certain trees cannot be grafted on others. Lastly, an embryo may\\nbe developed, and then perish at an early period. This latter alternative\\nhas not been sufficiently attended to; but I believe, from observations\\ncommunicated to me by Mr. Hewitt, who has had great experience in\\nhybridising gallinaceous birds, that the early death of the embryo is a\\nvery frequent cause of sterility in first crosses. I was at first very\\nunwilling to believe in this view; as hybrids, when once born, are\\ngenerally healthy and long-lived, as we see in the case of the common mule.\\nHybrids, however, are differently circumstanced before and after birth:\\nwhen born and living in a country where their two parents can live, they\\nare generally placed under suitable conditions of life. But a hybrid\\npartakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its mother, and\\ntherefore before birth, as long as it is nourished within its mother\\'s womb\\nor within the egg or seed produced by the mother, it may be exposed to\\nconditions in some degree unsuitable, and consequently be liable to perish\\nat an early period; more especially as all very young beings seem eminently\\nsensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life.\\n\\nIn regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual elements are\\nimperfectly developed, the case is {265} very different. I have more than\\nonce alluded to a large body of facts, which I have collected, showing that\\nwhen animals and plants are removed from their natural conditions, they are\\nextremely liable to have their reproductive systems seriously affected.\\nThis, in fact, is the great bar to the domestication of animals. Between\\nthe sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids, there are many points\\nof similarity. In both cases the sterility is independent of general\\nhealth, and is often accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance. In\\nboth cases, the sterility occurs in various degrees; in both, the male\\nelement is the most liable to be affected; but sometimes the female more\\nthan the male. In both, the tendency goes to a certain extent with\\nsystematic affinity, for whole groups of animals and plants are rendered\\nimpotent by the same unnatural conditions; and whole groups of species tend\\nto produce sterile hybrids. On the other hand, one species in a group will\\nsometimes resist great changes of conditions with unimpaired fertility; and\\ncertain species in a group will produce unusually fertile hybrids. No one\\ncan tell, till he tries, whether any particular animal will breed under\\nconfinement or any exotic plant seed freely under culture; nor can he tell,\\ntill he tries, whether any two species of a genus will produce more or less\\nsterile hybrids. Lastly, when organic beings are placed during several\\ngenerations under conditions not natural to them, they are extremely liable\\nto vary, which is due, as I believe, to their reproductive systems having\\nbeen specially affected, though in a lesser degree than when sterility\\nensues. So it is with hybrids, for hybrids in successive generations are\\neminently liable to vary, as every experimentalist has observed.\\n\\nThus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural\\nconditions, and when hybrids {266} are produced by the unnatural crossing\\nof two species, the reproductive system, independently of the general state\\nof health, is affected by sterility in a very similar manner. In the one\\ncase, the conditions of life have been disturbed, though often in so slight\\na degree as to be inappreciable by us; in the other case, or that of\\nhybrids, the external conditions have remained the same, but the\\norganisation has been disturbed by two different structures and\\nconstitutions having been blended into one. For it is scarcely possible\\nthat two organisations should be compounded into one, without some\\ndisturbance occurring in the development, or periodical action, or mutual\\nrelation of the different parts and organs one to another, or to the\\nconditions of life. When hybrids are able to breed _inter se_, they\\ntransmit to their offspring from generation to generation the same\\ncompounded organisation, and hence we need not be surprised that their\\nsterility, though in some degree variable, rarely diminishes.\\n\\nIt must, however, be confessed that we cannot understand, excepting on\\nvague hypotheses, several facts with respect to the sterility of hybrids;\\nfor instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal\\ncrosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally and\\nexceptionally resemble closely either pure parent. Nor do I pretend that\\nthe foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter: no explanation is\\noffered why an organism, when placed under unnatural conditions, is\\nrendered sterile. All that I have attempted to show, is that in two cases,\\nin some respects allied, sterility is the common result,--in the one case\\nfrom the conditions of life having been disturbed, in the other case from\\nthe organisation having been disturbed by two organisations having been\\ncompounded into one.\\n\\nIt may seem fanciful, but I suspect that a similar {267} parallelism\\nextends to an allied yet very different class of facts. It is an old and\\nalmost universal belief, founded, I think, on a considerable body of\\nevidence, that slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to\\nall living things. We see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their\\nfrequent exchanges of seed, tubers, &c., from one soil or climate to\\nanother, and back again. During the convalescence of animals, we plainly\\nsee that great benefit is derived from almost any change in the habits of\\nlife. Again, both with plants and animals, there is abundant evidence, that\\na cross between very distinct individuals of the same species, that is\\nbetween members of different strains or sub-breeds, gives vigour and\\nfertility to the offspring. I believe, indeed, from the facts alluded to in\\nour fourth chapter, that a certain amount of crossing is indispensable even\\nwith hermaphrodites; and that close interbreeding continued during several\\ngenerations between the nearest relations, especially if these be kept\\nunder the same conditions of life, always induces weakness and sterility in\\nthe progeny.\\n\\nHence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the conditions of\\nlife benefit all organic beings, and on the other hand, that slight\\ncrosses, that is crosses between the males and females of the same species\\nwhich have varied and become slightly different, give vigour and fertility\\nto the offspring. But we have seen that greater changes, or changes of a\\nparticular nature, often render organic beings in some degree sterile; and\\nthat greater crosses, that is crosses between males and females which have\\nbecome widely or specifically different, produce hybrids which are\\ngenerally sterile in some degree. I cannot persuade myself that this\\nparallelism is an accident or an illusion. Both series of facts seem to be\\nconnected together by some {268} common but unknown bond, which is\\nessentially related to the principle of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Fertility of Varieties when crossed, and of their Mongrel offspring._--It\\nmay be urged, as a most forcible argument, that there must be some\\nessential distinction between species and varieties, and that there must be\\nsome error in all the foregoing remarks, inasmuch as varieties, however\\nmuch they may differ from each other in external appearance, cross with\\nperfect facility, and yield perfectly fertile offspring. I fully admit that\\nthis is almost invariably the case. But if we look to varieties produced\\nunder nature, we are immediately involved in hopeless difficulties; for if\\ntwo hitherto reputed varieties be found in any degree sterile together,\\nthey are at once ranked by most naturalists as species. For instance, the\\nblue and red pimpernel, the primrose and cowslip, which are considered by\\nmany of our best botanists as varieties, are said by GГ¤rtner not to be\\nquite fertile when crossed, and he consequently ranks them as undoubted\\nspecies. If we thus argue in a circle, the fertility of all varieties\\nproduced under nature will assuredly have to be granted.\\n\\nIf we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been produced, under\\ndomestication, we are still involved in doubt. For when it is stated, for\\ninstance, that the German Spitz dog unites more easily than other dogs with\\nfoxes, or that certain South American indigenous domestic dogs do not\\nreadily cross with European dogs, the explanation which will occur to every\\none, and probably the true one, is that these dogs have descended from\\nseveral aboriginally distinct species. Nevertheless the perfect fertility\\nof so many domestic varieties, differing widely from each other in\\nappearance, for instance of the pigeon or of the cabbage, is {269} a\\nremarkable fact; more especially when we reflect how many species there\\nare, which, though resembling each other most closely, are utterly sterile\\nwhen intercrossed. Several considerations, however, render the fertility of\\ndomestic varieties less remarkable than at first appears. It can, in the\\nfirst place, be clearly shown that mere external dissimilarity between two\\nspecies does not determine their greater or lesser degree of sterility when\\ncrossed; and we may apply the same rule to domestic varieties. In the\\nsecond place, some eminent naturalists believe that a long course of\\ndomestication tends to eliminate sterility in the successive generations of\\nhybrids which were at first only slightly sterile; and if this be so, we\\nsurely ought not to expect to find sterility both appearing and\\ndisappearing under nearly the same conditions of life. Lastly, and this\\nseems to me by far the most important consideration, new races of animals\\nand plants are produced under domestication by man\\'s methodical and\\nunconscious power of selection, for his own use and pleasure: he neither\\nwishes to select, nor could select, slight differences in the reproductive\\nsystem, or other constitutional differences correlated with the\\nreproductive system. He supplies his several varieties with the same food;\\ntreats them in nearly the same manner, and does not wish to alter their\\ngeneral habits of life. Nature acts uniformly and slowly during vast\\nperiods of time on the whole organisation, in any way which may be for each\\ncreature\\'s own good; and thus she may, either directly, or more probably\\nindirectly, through correlation, modify the reproductive system in the\\nseveral descendants from any one species. Seeing this difference in the\\nprocess of selection, as carried on by man and nature, we need not be\\nsurprised at some difference in the result.\\n\\nI have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same {270} species were\\ninvariably fertile when intercrossed. But it seems to me impossible to\\nresist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in\\nthe few following cases, which I will briefly abstract. The evidence is at\\nleast as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a multitude\\nof species. The evidence is, also, derived from hostile witnesses, who in\\nall other cases consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of\\nspecific distinction. GГ¤rtner kept during several years a dwarf kind of\\nmaize with yellow seeds, and a tall variety with red seeds, growing near\\neach other in his garden; and although these plants have separated sexes,\\nthey never naturally crossed. He then fertilised thirteen flowers of the\\none with the pollen of the other; but only a single head produced any seed,\\nand this one head produced only five grains. Manipulation in this case\\ncould not have been injurious, as the plants have separated sexes. No one,\\nI believe, has suspected that these varieties of maize are distinct\\nspecies; and it is important to notice that the hybrid plants thus raised\\nwere themselves _perfectly_ fertile; so that even GГ¤rtner did not venture\\nto consider the two varieties as specifically distinct.\\n\\nGirou de Buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd, which like the\\nmaize has separated sexes, and he asserts that their mutual fertilisation\\nis by so much the less easy as their differences are greater. How far these\\nexperiments may be trusted, I know not; but the forms experimentised on,\\nare ranked by Sagaret, who mainly founds his classification by the test of\\ninfertility, as varieties.\\n\\nThe following case is far more remarkable, and seems at first quite\\nincredible; but it is the result of an astonishing number of experiments\\nmade during many years on nine species of Verbascum, by so good an observer\\n{271} and so hostile a witness, as GГ¤rtner: namely, that yellow and white\\nvarieties of the same species of Verbascum when intercrossed produce less\\nseed, than do either coloured varieties when fertilised with pollen from\\ntheir own coloured flowers. Moreover, he asserts that when yellow and white\\nvarieties of one species are crossed with yellow and white varieties of a\\n_distinct_ species, more seed is produced by the crosses between the\\nsimilarly coloured flowers, than between those which are differently\\ncoloured. Yet these varieties of Verbascum present no other difference\\nbesides the mere colour of the flower; and one variety can sometimes be\\nraised from the seed of the other.\\n\\nFrom observations which I have made on certain varieties of hollyhock, I am\\ninclined to suspect that they present analogous facts.\\n\\nKГ¶lreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent observer,\\nhas proved the remarkable fact, that one variety of the common tobacco is\\nmore fertile, when crossed with a widely distinct species, than are the\\nother varieties. He experimentised on five forms, which are commonly\\nreputed to be varieties, and which he tested by the severest trial, namely,\\nby reciprocal crosses, and he found their mongrel offspring perfectly\\nfertile. But one of these five varieties, when used either as father or\\nmother, and crossed with the Nicotiana glutinosa, always yielded hybrids\\nnot so sterile as those which were produced from the four other varieties\\nwhen crossed with N. glutinosa. Hence the reproductive system of this one\\nvariety must have been in some manner and in some degree modified.\\n\\nFrom these facts; from the great difficulty of ascertaining the infertility\\nof varieties in a state of nature, for a supposed variety if infertile in\\nany degree would generally be ranked as species; from man selecting only\\n{272} external characters in the production of the most distinct domestic\\nvarieties, and from not wishing or being able to produce recondite and\\nfunctional differences in the reproductive system; from these several\\nconsiderations and facts, I do not think that the very general fertility of\\nvarieties can be proved to be of universal occurrence, or to form a\\nfundamental distinction between varieties and species. The general\\nfertility of varieties does not seem to me sufficient to overthrow the view\\nwhich I have taken with respect to the very general, but not invariable,\\nsterility of first crosses and of hybrids, namely, that it is not a special\\nendowment, but is incidental on slowly acquired modifications, more\\nespecially in the reproductive systems of the forms which are crossed.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Hybrids and Mongrels compared, independently of their\\nfertility._--Independently of the question of fertility, the offspring of\\nspecies when crossed and of varieties when crossed may be compared in\\nseveral other respects. GГ¤rtner, whose strong wish was to draw a marked\\nline of distinction between species and varieties, could find very few and,\\nas it seems to me, quite unimportant differences between the so-called\\nhybrid offspring of species, and the so-called mongrel offspring of\\nvarieties. And, on the other hand, they agree most closely in very many\\nimportant respects.\\n\\nI shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity. The most important\\ndistinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are more variable\\nthan hybrids; but GГ¤rtner admits that hybrids from species which have long\\nbeen cultivated are often variable in the first generation; and I have\\nmyself seen striking instances of this fact. GГ¤rtner further admits that\\nhybrids between very closely allied species are more variable {273} than\\nthose from very distinct species; and this shows that the difference in the\\ndegree of variability graduates away. When mongrels and the more fertile\\nhybrids are propagated for several generations an extreme amount of\\nvariability in their offspring is notorious; but some few cases both of\\nhybrids and mongrels long retaining uniformity of character could be given.\\nThe variability, however, in the successive generations of mongrels is,\\nperhaps, greater than in hybrids.\\n\\nThis greater variability of mongrels than of hybrids does not seem to me at\\nall surprising. For the parents of mongrels are varieties, and mostly\\ndomestic varieties (very few experiments having been tried on natural\\nvarieties), and this implies in most cases that there has been recent\\nvariability; and therefore we might expect that such variability would\\noften continue and be superadded to that arising from the mere act of\\ncrossing. The slight degree of variability in hybrids from the first cross\\nor in the first generation, in contrast with their extreme variability in\\nthe succeeding generations, is a curious fact and deserves attention. For\\nit bears on and corroborates the view which I have taken on the cause of\\nordinary variability; namely, that it is due to the reproductive system\\nbeing eminently sensitive to any change in the conditions of life, being\\nthus often rendered either impotent or at least incapable of its proper\\nfunction of producing offspring identical with the parent-form. Now hybrids\\nin the first generation are descended from species (excluding those long\\ncultivated) which have not had their reproductive systems in any way\\naffected, and they are not variable; but hybrids themselves have their\\nreproductive systems seriously affected, and their descendants are highly\\nvariable.\\n\\nBut to return to our comparison of mongrels and {274} hybrids: GГ¤rtner\\nstates that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either\\nparent-form; but this, if it be true, is certainly only a difference in\\ndegree. GГ¤rtner further insists that when any two species, although most\\nclosely allied to each other, are crossed with a third species, the hybrids\\nare widely different from each other; whereas if two very distinct\\nvarieties of one species are crossed with another species, the hybrids do\\nnot differ much. But this conclusion, as far as I can make out, is founded\\non a single experiment; and seems directly opposed to the results of\\nseveral experiments made by KГ¶lreuter.\\n\\nThese alone are the unimportant differences, which GГ¤rtner is able to point\\nout, between hybrid and mongrel plants. On the other hand, the resemblance\\nin mongrels and in hybrids to their respective parents, more especially in\\nhybrids produced from nearly related species, follows according to GГ¤rtner\\nthe same laws. When two species are crossed, one has sometimes a prepotent\\npower of impressing its likeness on the hybrid; and so I believe it to be\\nwith varieties of plants. With animals one variety certainly often has this\\nprepotent power over another variety. Hybrid plants produced from a\\nreciprocal cross, generally resemble each other closely; and so it is with\\nmongrels from a reciprocal cross. Both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced\\nto either pure parent-form, by repeated crosses in successive generations\\nwith either parent.\\n\\nThese several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but the subject\\nis here excessively complicated, partly owing to the existence of secondary\\nsexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency in transmitting\\nlikeness running more strongly in one sex than in the other, both when one\\nspecies is crossed with another, and when, one variety is crossed with\\n{275} another variety. For instance, I think those authors are right, who\\nmaintain that the ass has a prepotent power over the horse, so that both\\nthe mule and the hinny more resemble the ass than the horse; but that the\\nprepotency runs more strongly in the male-ass than in the female, so that\\nthe mule, which is the offspring of the male-ass and mare, is more like an\\nass, than is the hinny, which is the offspring of the female-ass and\\nstallion.\\n\\nMuch stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact, that\\nmongrel animals alone are born closely like one of their parents; but it\\ncan be shown that this does sometimes occur with hybrids; yet I grant much\\nless frequently with hybrids than with mongrels. Looking to the cases which\\nI have collected of cross-bred animals closely resembling one parent, the\\nresemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almost monstrous in their\\nnature, and which have suddenly appeared--such as albinism, melanism,\\ndeficiency of tail or horns, or additional fingers and toes; and do not\\nrelate to characters which have been slowly acquired by selection.\\nConsequently, sudden reversions to the perfect character of either parent\\nwould be more likely to occur with mongrels, which are descended from\\nvarieties often suddenly produced and semi-monstrous in character, than\\nwith hybrids, which are descended from species slowly and naturally\\nproduced. On the whole I entirely agree with Dr. Prosper Lucas, who, after\\narranging an enormous body of facts with respect to animals, comes to the\\nconclusion, that the laws of resemblance of the child to its parents are\\nthe same, whether the two parents differ much or little from each other,\\nnamely in the union of individuals of the same variety, or of different\\nvarieties, or of distinct species.\\n\\nLaying aside the question of fertility and sterility, {276} in all other\\nrespects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the offspring\\nof crossed species, and of crossed varieties. If we look at species as\\nhaving been specially created, and at varieties as having been produced by\\nsecondary laws, this similarity would be an astonishing fact. But it\\nharmonises perfectly with the view that there is no essential distinction\\nbetween species and varieties.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Summary of Chapter._--First crosses between forms sufficiently distinct to\\nbe ranked as species, and their hybrids, are very generally, but not\\nuniversally, sterile. The sterility is of all degrees, and is often so\\nslight that the two most careful experimentalists who have ever lived, have\\ncome to diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test.\\nThe sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species, and\\nis eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions. The\\ndegree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity, but is\\ngoverned by several curious and complex laws. It is generally different,\\nand sometimes widely different, in reciprocal crosses between the same two\\nspecies. It is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in the\\nhybrid produced from this cross.\\n\\nIn the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity of one species or\\nvariety to take on another, is incidental on generally unknown differences\\nin their vegetative systems, so in crossing, the greater or less facility\\nof one species to unite with another, is incidental on unknown differences\\nin their reproductive systems. There is no more reason to think that\\nspecies have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to\\nprevent them crossing and blending in nature, than to think that trees have\\nbeen specially endowed with various and {277} somewhat analogous degrees of\\ndifficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them becoming\\ninarched in our forests.\\n\\nThe sterility of first crosses between pure species, which have their\\nreproductive systems perfect, seems to depend on several circumstances; in\\nsome cases largely on the early death of the embryo. The sterility of\\nhybrids, which have their reproductive systems imperfect, and which have\\nhad this system and their whole organisation disturbed by being compounded\\nof two distinct species, seems closely allied to that sterility which so\\nfrequently affects pure species, when their natural conditions of life have\\nbeen disturbed. This view is supported by a parallelism of another\\nkind;--namely, that the crossing of forms only slightly different is\\nfavourable to the vigour and fertility of their offspring; and that slight\\nchanges in the conditions of life are apparently favourable to the vigour\\nand fertility of all organic beings. It is not surprising that the degree\\nof difficulty in uniting two species, and the degree of sterility of their\\nhybrid-offspring should generally correspond, though due to distinct\\ncauses; for both depend on the amount of difference of some kind between\\nthe species which are crossed. Nor is it surprising that the facility of\\neffecting a first cross, the fertility of the hybrids produced from it, and\\nthe capacity of being grafted together--though this latter capacity\\nevidently depends on widely different circumstances--should all run, to a\\ncertain extent, parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which\\nare subjected to experiment; for systematic affinity attempts to express\\nall kinds of resemblance between all species.\\n\\nFirst crosses between forms known to be varieties, or sufficiently alike to\\nbe considered as varieties, and their mongrel offspring, are very\\ngenerally, but not quite {278} universally, fertile. Nor is this nearly\\ngeneral and perfect fertility surprising, when we remember how liable we\\nare to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature;\\nand when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been\\nproduced under domestication by the selection of mere external differences,\\nand not of differences in the reproductive system. In all other respects,\\nexcluding fertility, there is a close general resemblance between hybrids\\nand mongrels. Finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not\\nseem to me opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is\\nno fundamental distinction between species and varieties.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{279}\\n\\nCHAPTER IX.\\n\\nON THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD.\\n\\n    On the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day--On the\\n    nature of extinct intermediate varieties; on their number--On the vast\\n    lapse of time, as inferred from the rate of deposition and of\\n    denudation--On the poorness of our palГ¦ontological collections--On the\\n    intermittence of geological formations--On the absence of intermediate\\n    varieties in any one formation--On the sudden appearance of groups of\\n    species--On their sudden appearance in the lowest known fossiliferous\\n    strata.\\n\\nIn the sixth chapter I enumerated the chief objections which might be\\njustly urged against the views maintained in this volume. Most of them have\\nnow been discussed. One, namely the distinctness of specific forms, and\\ntheir not being blended together by innumerable transitional links, is a\\nvery obvious difficulty. I assigned reasons why such links do not commonly\\noccur at the present day, under the circumstances apparently most\\nfavourable for their presence, namely on an extensive and continuous area\\nwith graduated physical conditions. I endeavoured to show, that the life of\\neach species depends in a more important manner on the presence of other\\nalready defined organic forms, than on climate; and, therefore, that the\\nreally governing conditions of life do not graduate away quite insensibly\\nlike heat or moisture. I endeavoured, also, to show that intermediate\\nvarieties, from existing in lesser numbers than the forms which they\\nconnect, will generally be beaten out and exterminated during the course of\\nfurther modification and improvement. The main cause, however, of\\ninnumerable intermediate links not now occurring everywhere throughout\\nnature {280} depends on the very process of natural selection, through\\nwhich new varieties continually take the places of and exterminate their\\nparent-forms. But just in proportion as this process of extermination has\\nacted on an enormous scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties,\\nwhich have formerly existed on the earth, be truly enormous. Why then is\\nnot every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate\\nlinks? Geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic\\nchain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which\\ncan be urged against my theory. The explanation lies, as I believe, in the\\nextreme imperfection of the geological record.\\n\\nIn the first place it should always be borne in mind what sort of\\nintermediate forms must, on my theory, have formerly existed. I have found\\nit difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid picturing to\\nmyself, forms _directly_ intermediate between them. But this is a wholly\\nfalse view; we should always look for forms intermediate between each\\nspecies and a common but unknown progenitor; and the progenitor will\\ngenerally have differed in some respects from all its modified descendants.\\nTo give a simple illustration: the fantail and pouter pigeons have both\\ndescended from the rock-pigeon; if we possessed all the intermediate\\nvarieties which have ever existed, we should have an extremely close series\\nbetween both and the rock-pigeon; but we should have no varieties directly\\nintermediate between the fantail and pouter; none, for instance, combining\\na tail somewhat expanded with a crop somewhat enlarged, the characteristic\\nfeatures of these two breeds. These two breeds, moreover, have become so\\nmuch modified, that if we had no historical or indirect evidence regarding\\ntheir origin, it would not have been possible to have {281} determined from\\na mere comparison of their structure with that of the rock-pigeon, whether\\nthey had descended from this species or from some other allied species,\\nsuch as C. oenas.\\n\\nSo with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for instance to\\nthe horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that links ever existed\\ndirectly intermediate between them, but between each and an unknown common\\nparent. The common parent will have had in its whole organisation much\\ngeneral resemblance to the tapir and to the horse; but in some points of\\nstructure may have differed considerably from both, even perhaps more than\\nthey differ from each other. Hence in all such cases, we should be unable\\nto recognise the parent-form of any two or more species, even if we closely\\ncompared the structure of the parent with that of its modified descendants,\\nunless at the same time we had a nearly perfect chain of the intermediate\\nlinks.\\n\\nIt is just possible by my theory, that one of two living forms might have\\ndescended from the other; for instance, a horse from a tapir; and in this\\ncase _direct_ intermediate links will have existed between them. But such a\\ncase would imply that one form had remained for a very long period\\nunaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of change;\\nand the principle of competition between organism and organism, between\\nchild and parent, will render this a very rare event; for in all cases the\\nnew and improved forms of life tend to supplant the old and unimproved\\nforms.\\n\\nBy the theory of natural selection all living species have been connected\\nwith the parent-species of each genus, by differences not greater than we\\nsee between the varieties of the same species at the present {282} day; and\\nthese parent-species, now generally extinct, have in their turn been\\nsimilarly connected with more ancient species; and so on backwards, always\\nconverging to the common ancestor of each great class. So that the number\\nof intermediate and transitional links, between all living and extinct\\nspecies, must have been inconceivably great. But assuredly, if this theory\\nbe true, such have lived upon this earth.\\n\\n\\n\\n_On the lapse of Time._--Independently of our not finding fossil remains of\\nsuch infinitely numerous connecting links, it may be objected, that time\\nwill not have sufficed for so great an amount of organic change, all\\nchanges having been effected very slowly through natural selection. It is\\nhardly possible for me even to recall to the reader, who may not be a\\npractical geologist, the facts leading the mind feebly to comprehend the\\nlapse of time. He who can read Sir Charles Lyell\\'s grand work on the\\nPrinciples of Geology, which the future historian will recognise as having\\nproduced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how\\nincomprehensively vast have been the past periods of time, may at once\\nclose this volume. Not that it suffices to study the Principles of Geology,\\nor to read special treatises by different observers on separate formations,\\nand to mark how each author attempts to give an inadequate idea of the\\nduration of each formation or even each stratum. A man must for years\\nexamine for himself great piles of superimposed strata, and watch the sea\\nat work grinding down old rocks and making fresh sediment, before he can\\nhope to comprehend anything of the lapse of time, the monuments of which we\\nsee around us.\\n\\nIt is good to wander along lines of sea-coast, when formed of moderately\\nhard rocks, and mark the {283} process of degradation. The tides in most\\ncases reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day, and the waves eat\\ninto them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles; for there is\\ngood evidence that pure water can effect little or nothing in wearing away\\nrock. At last the base of the cliff is undermined, huge fragments fall\\ndown, and these remaining fixed, have to be worn away, atom by atom, until\\nreduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves, and then are more\\nquickly ground into pebbles, sand, or mud. But how often do we see along\\nthe bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders, all thickly clothed by\\nmarine productions, showing how little they are abraded and how seldom they\\nare rolled about! Moreover, if we follow for a few miles any line of rocky\\ncliff, which is undergoing degradation, we find that it is only here and\\nthere, along a short length or round a promontory, that the cliffs are at\\nthe present time suffering. The appearance of the surface and the\\nvegetation show that elsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed\\ntheir base.\\n\\nHe who most closely studies the action of the sea on our shores, will, I\\nbelieve, be most deeply impressed with the slowness with which rocky coasts\\nare worn away. The observations on this head by Hugh Miller, and by that\\nexcellent observer Mr. Smith of Jordan Hill, are most impressive. With the\\nmind thus impressed, let any one examine beds of conglomerate many thousand\\nfeet in thickness, which, though probably formed at a quicker rate than\\nmany other deposits, yet, from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles,\\neach of which bears the stamp of time, are good to show how slowly the mass\\nhas been accumulated. In the Cordillera I estimated one pile of\\nconglomerate at ten thousand feet in thickness. Let the {284} observer\\nremember Lyell\\'s profound remark that the thickness and extent of\\nsedimentary formations are the result and measure of the degradation which\\nthe earth\\'s crust has elsewhere suffered. And what an amount of degradation\\nis implied by the sedimentary deposits of many countries! Professor Ramsay\\nhas given me the maximum thickness, in most cases from actual measurement,\\nin a few cases from estimate, of each formation in different parts of Great\\nBritain; and this is the result:--\\n\\n                                                     Feet.\\n  PalГ¦ozoic strata (not including igneous beds)      57,154\\n  Secondary strata                                   13,190\\n  Tertiary strata                                     2,240\\n\\n--making altogether 72,584 feet; that is, very nearly thirteen and\\nthree-quarters British miles. Some of the formations, which are represented\\nin England by thin beds, are thousands of feet in thickness on the\\nContinent. Moreover, between each successive formation, we have, in the\\nopinion of most geologists, enormously long blank periods. So that the\\nlofty pile of sedimentary rocks in Britain, gives but an inadequate idea of\\nthe time which has elapsed during their accumulation; yet what time this\\nmust have consumed! Good observers have estimated that sediment is\\ndeposited by the great Mississippi river at the rate of only 600 feet in a\\nhundred thousand years. This estimate has no pretension to strict\\nexactness; yet, considering over what wide spaces very fine sediment is\\ntransported by the currents of the sea, the process of accumulation in any\\none area must be extremely slow.\\n\\nBut the amount of denudation which the strata have in many places suffered,\\nindependently of the rate of accumulation of the degraded matter, probably\\noffers the best evidence of the lapse of time. I remember {285} having been\\nmuch struck with the evidence of denudation, when viewing volcanic islands,\\nwhich have been worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular\\ncliffs of one or two thousand feet in height; for the gentle slope of the\\nlava-streams, due to their formerly liquid state, showed at a glance how\\nfar the hard, rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean. The same\\nstory is still more plainly told by faults,--those great cracks along which\\nthe strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown down on the other, to\\nthe height or depth of thousands of feet; for since the crust cracked, the\\nsurface of the land has been so completely planed down by the action of the\\nsea, that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible.\\n\\nThe Craven fault, for instance, extends for upwards of 30 miles, and along\\nthis line the vertical displacement of the strata has varied from 600 to\\n3000 feet. Prof. Ramsay has published an account of a downthrow in Anglesea\\nof 2300 feet; and he informs me that he fully believes there is one in\\nMerionethshire of 12,000 feet; yet in these cases there is nothing on the\\nsurface to show such prodigious movements; the pile of rocks on the one or\\nother side having been smoothly swept away. The consideration of these\\nfacts impresses my mind almost in the same manner as does the vain\\nendeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity.\\n\\nI am tempted to give one other case, the well-known one of the denudation\\nof the Weald. Though it must be admitted that the denudation of the Weald\\nhas been a mere trifle, in comparison with that which has removed masses of\\nour palГ¦ozoic strata, in parts ten thousand feet in thickness, as shown in\\nProf. Ramsay\\'s masterly memoir on this subject: yet it is an admirable\\nlesson to stand on the intermediate hilly country and look on the one hand\\nat the North Downs, and {286} on the other hand at the South Downs; for,\\nremembering that at no great distance to the west the northern and southern\\nescarpments meet and close, one can safely picture to oneself the great\\ndome of rocks which must have covered up the Weald within so limited a\\nperiod as since the latter part of the Chalk formation. The distance from\\nthe northern to the southern Downs is about 22 miles, and the thickness of\\nthe several formations is on an average about 1100 feet, as I am informed\\nby Prof. Ramsay. But if, as some geologists suppose, a range of older rocks\\nunderlies the Weald, on the flanks of which the overlying sedimentary\\ndeposits might have accumulated in thinner masses than elsewhere, the above\\nestimate would be erroneous; but this source of doubt probably would not\\ngreatly affect the estimate as applied to the western extremity of the\\ndistrict. If, then, we knew the rate at which the sea commonly wears away a\\nline of cliff of any given height, we could measure the time requisite to\\nhave denuded the Weald. This, of course cannot be done; but we may, in\\norder to form some crude notion on the subject, assume that the sea would\\neat into cliffs 500 feet in height at the rate of one inch in a century.\\nThis will at first appear much too small an allowance; but it is the same\\nas if we were to assume a cliff one yard in height to be eaten back along a\\nwhole line of coast at the rate of one yard in nearly every twenty-two\\nyears. I doubt whether any rock, even as soft as chalk, would yield at this\\nrate excepting on the most exposed coasts; though no doubt the degradation\\nof a lofty cliff would be more rapid from the breakage of the fallen\\nfragments. On the other hand, I do not believe that any line of coast, ten\\nor twenty miles in length, ever suffers degradation at the same time along\\nits whole indented length; and we {287} must remember that almost all\\nstrata contain harder layers or nodules, which from long resisting\\nattrition form a breakwater at the base. We may at least confidently\\nbelieve that no rocky coast 500 feet in height commonly yields at the rate\\nof a foot per century; for this would be the same in amount as a cliff one\\nyard in height retreating twelve yards in twenty-two years; and no one, I\\nthink, who has carefully observed the shape of old fallen fragments at the\\nbase of cliffs, will admit any near approach to such rapid wearing away.\\nHence, under ordinary circumstances, I should infer that for a cliff 500\\nfeet in height, a denudation of one inch per century for the whole length\\nwould be a sufficient allowance. At this rate, on the above data, the\\ndenudation of the Weald must have required 306,662,400 years; or say three\\nhundred million years. But perhaps it would be safer to allow two or three\\ninches per century, and this would reduce the number of years to one\\nhundred and fifty or one hundred million years.\\n\\nThe action of fresh water on the gently inclined Wealden district, when\\nupraised, could hardly have been great, but it would somewhat reduce the\\nabove estimate. On the other hand, during oscillations of level, which we\\nknow this area has undergone, the surface may have existed for millions of\\nyears as land, and thus have escaped the action of the sea: when deeply\\nsubmerged for perhaps equally long periods, it would, likewise, have\\nescaped the action of the coast-waves. So that it is not improbable that a\\nlonger period than 300 million years has elapsed since the latter part of\\nthe Secondary period.\\n\\nI have made these few remarks because it is highly important for us to gain\\nsome notion, however imperfect, of the lapse of years. During each of these\\nyears, {288} over the whole world, the land and the water has been peopled\\nby hosts of living forms. What an infinite number of generations, which the\\nmind cannot grasp, must have succeeded each other in the long roll of\\nyears! Now turn to our richest geological museums, and what a paltry\\ndisplay we behold!\\n\\n\\n\\n_On the poorness of our PalГ¦ontological collections._--That our\\npalГ¦ontological collections are very imperfect, is admitted by every one.\\nThe remark of that admirable palГ¦ontologist, the late Edward Forbes, should\\nnot be forgotten, namely, that numbers of our fossil species are known and\\nnamed from single and often broken specimens, or from a few specimens\\ncollected on some one spot. Only a small portion of the surface of the\\nearth has been geologically explored, and no part with sufficient care, as\\nthe important discoveries made every year in Europe prove. No organism\\nwholly soft can be preserved. Shells and bones will decay and disappear\\nwhen left on the bottom of the sea, where sediment is not accumulating. I\\nbelieve we are continually taking a most erroneous view, when we tacitly\\nadmit to ourselves that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole\\nbed of the sea, at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil\\nremains. Throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright\\nblue tint of the water bespeaks its purity. The many cases on record of a\\nformation conformably covered, after an enormous interval of time, by\\nanother and later formation, without the underlying bed having suffered in\\nthe interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view of the\\nbottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition. The\\nremains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel, will when the beds\\nare upraised generally be dissolved {289} by the percolation of rain-water.\\nI suspect that but few of the very many animals which live on the beach\\nbetween high and low watermark are preserved. For instance, the several\\nspecies of the ChthamalinГ¦ (a subfamily of sessile cirripedes) coat the\\nrocks all over the world in infinite numbers: they are all strictly\\nlittoral, with the exception of a single Mediterranean species, which\\ninhabits deep water and has been found fossil in Sicily, whereas not one\\nother species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation: yet it is\\nnow known that the genus Chthamalus existed during the chalk period. The\\nmolluscan genus Chiton offers a partially analogous case.\\n\\nWith respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the\\nSecondary and PalГ¦ozoic periods, it is superfluous to state that our\\nevidence from fossil remains is fragmentary in an extreme degree. For\\ninstance, not a land shell is known belonging to either of these vast\\nperiods, with the exception of one species discovered by Sir C. Lyell and\\nDr. Dawson in the carboniferous strata of North America, of which shell\\nseveral specimens have now been collected. In regard to mammiferous\\nremains, a single glance at the historical table published in the\\nSupplement to Lyell\\'s Manual, will bring home the truth, how accidental and\\nrare is their preservation, far better than pages of detail. Nor is their\\nrarity surprising, when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of\\ntertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine\\ndeposits; and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging to\\nthe age of our secondary or palГ¦ozoic formations.\\n\\nBut the imperfection in the geological record mainly results from another\\nand more important cause than any of the foregoing; namely, from the\\nseveral formations {290} being separated from each other by wide intervals\\nof time. When we see the formations tabulated in written works, or when we\\nfollow them in nature, it is difficult to avoid believing that they are\\nclosely consecutive. But we know, for instance, from Sir R. Murchison\\'s\\ngreat work on Russia, what wide gaps there are in that country between the\\nsuperimposed formations; so it is in North America, and in many other parts\\nof the world. The most skilful geologist, if his attention had been\\nexclusively confined to these large territories, would never have suspected\\nthat during the periods which were blank and barren in his own country,\\ngreat piles of sediment, charged with new and peculiar forms of life, had\\nelsewhere been accumulated. And if in each separate territory, hardly any\\nidea can be formed of the length of time which has elapsed between the\\nconsecutive formations, we may infer that this could nowhere be\\nascertained. The frequent and great changes in the mineralogical\\ncomposition of consecutive formations, generally implying great changes in\\nthe geography of the surrounding lands, whence the sediment has been\\nderived, accords with the belief of vast intervals of time having elapsed\\nbetween each formation.\\n\\nBut we can, I think, see why the geological formations of each region are\\nalmost invariably intermittent; that is, have not followed each other in\\nclose sequence. Scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many\\nhundred miles of the South American coasts, which have been upraised\\nseveral hundred feet within the recent period, than the absence of any\\nrecent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short geological\\nperiod. Along the whole west coast, which is inhabited by a peculiar marine\\nfauna, tertiary beds are so poorly developed, that no record of several\\n{291} successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be preserved to a\\ndistant age. A little reflection will explain why along the rising coast of\\nthe western side of South America, no extensive formations with recent or\\ntertiary remains can anywhere be found, though the supply of sediment must\\nfor ages have been great, from the enormous degradation of the coast-rocks\\nand from muddy streams entering the sea. The explanation, no doubt, is,\\nthat the littoral and sub-littoral deposits are continually worn away, as\\nsoon as they are brought up by the slow and gradual rising of the land\\nwithin the grinding action of the coast-waves.\\n\\nWe may, I think, safely conclude that sediment must be accumulated in\\nextremely thick, solid, or extensive masses, in order to withstand the\\nincessant action of the waves, when first upraised and during subsequent\\noscillations of level. Such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment\\nmay be formed in two ways; either, in profound depths of the sea, in which\\ncase, judging from the researches of E. Forbes, we may conclude that the\\nbottom will be inhabited by extremely few animals, and the mass when\\nupraised will give a most imperfect record of the forms of life which then\\nexisted; or, sediment may be accumulated to any thickness and extent over a\\nshallow bottom, if it continue slowly to subside. In this latter case, as\\nlong as the rate of subsidence and supply of sediment nearly balance each\\nother, the sea will remain shallow and favourable for life, and thus a\\nfossiliferous formation thick enough, when upraised, to resist any amount\\nof degradation, may be formed.\\n\\nI am convinced that all our ancient formations, which are rich in fossils,\\nhave thus been formed during subsidence. Since publishing my views on this\\nsubject in 1845, I have watched the progress of {292} Geology, and have\\nbeen surprised to note how author after author, in treating of this or that\\ngreat formation, has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated during\\nsubsidence. I may add, that the only ancient tertiary formation on the west\\ncoast of South America, which has been bulky enough to resist such\\ndegradation as it has as yet suffered, but which will hardly last to a\\ndistant geological age, was certainly deposited during a downward\\noscillation of level, and thus gained considerable thickness.\\n\\nAll geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone numerous\\nslow oscillations of level, and apparently these oscillations have affected\\nwide spaces. Consequently formations rich in fossils and sufficiently thick\\nand extensive to resist subsequent degradation, may have been formed over\\nwide spaces during periods of subsidence, but only where the supply of\\nsediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and to embed and preserve\\nthe remains before they had time to decay. On the other hand, as long as\\nthe bed of the sea remained stationary, _thick_ deposits could not have\\nbeen accumulated in the shallow parts, which are the most favourable to\\nlife. Still less could this have happened during the alternate periods of\\nelevation; or, to speak more accurately, the beds which were then\\naccumulated will have been destroyed by being upraised and brought within\\nthe limits of the coast-action.\\n\\nThus the geological record will almost necessarily be rendered\\nintermittent. I feel much confidence in the truth of these views, for they\\nare in strict accordance with the general principles inculcated by Sir C.\\nLyell; and E. Forbes subsequently but independently arrived at a similar\\nconclusion.\\n\\nOne remark is here worth a passing notice. During periods of elevation the\\narea of the land and of the {293} adjoining shoal parts of the sea will be\\nincreased, and new stations will often be formed;--all circumstances most\\nfavourable, as previously explained, for the formation of new varieties and\\nspecies; but during such periods there will generally be a blank in the\\ngeological record. On the other hand, during subsidence, the inhabited area\\nand number of inhabitants will decrease (excepting the productions on the\\nshores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago), and\\nconsequently during subsidence, though there will be much extinction, fewer\\nnew varieties or species will be formed; and it is during these very\\nperiods of subsidence, that our great deposits rich in fossils have been\\naccumulated. Nature may almost be said to have guarded against the frequent\\ndiscovery of her transitional or linking forms.\\n\\nFrom the foregoing considerations it cannot be doubted that the geological\\nrecord, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect; but if we confine our\\nattention to any one formation, it becomes more difficult to understand,\\nwhy we do not therein find closely graduated varieties between the allied\\nspecies which lived at its commencement and at its close. Some cases are on\\nrecord of the same species presenting distinct varieties in the upper and\\nlower parts of the same formation, but, as they are rare, they may be here\\npassed over. Although each formation has indisputably required a vast\\nnumber of years for its deposition, I can see several reasons why each\\nshould not include a graduated series of links between the species which\\nthen lived; but I can by no means pretend to assign due proportional weight\\nto the following considerations.\\n\\nAlthough each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each perhaps\\nis short compared with the period requisite to change one species into\\nanother. I am {294} aware that two palГ¦ontologists, whose opinions are\\nworthy of much deference, namely Bronn and Woodward, have concluded that\\nthe average duration of each formation is twice or thrice as long as the\\naverage duration of specific forms. But insuperable difficulties, as it\\nseems to me, prevent us coming to any just conclusion on this head. When we\\nsee a species first appearing in the middle of any formation, it would be\\nrash in the extreme to infer that it had not elsewhere previously existed.\\nSo again when we find a species disappearing before the uppermost layers\\nhave been deposited, it would be equally rash to suppose that it then\\nbecame wholly extinct. We forget how small the area of Europe is compared\\nwith the rest of the world; nor have the several stages of the same\\nformation throughout Europe been correlated with perfect accuracy.\\n\\nWith marine animals of all kinds, we may safely infer a large amount of\\nmigration during climatal and other changes; and when we see a species\\nfirst appearing in any formation, the probability is that it only then\\nfirst immigrated into that area. It is well known, for instance, that\\nseveral species appeared somewhat earlier in the palГ¦ozoic beds of North\\nAmerica than in those of Europe; time having apparently been required for\\ntheir migration from the American to the European seas. In examining the\\nlatest deposits of various quarters of the world, it has everywhere been\\nnoted, that some few still existing species are common in the deposit, but\\nhave become extinct in the immediately surrounding sea; or, conversely,\\nthat some are now abundant in the neighbouring sea, but are rare or absent\\nin this particular deposit. It is an excellent lesson to reflect on the\\nascertained amount of migration of the inhabitants of Europe during the\\nGlacial period, which forms only a part of one whole geological period;\\n{295} and likewise to reflect on the great changes of level, on the\\ninordinately great change of climate, on the prodigious lapse of time, all\\nincluded within this same glacial period. Yet it may be doubted whether in\\nany quarter of the world, sedimentary deposits, _including fossil remains_,\\nhave gone on accumulating within the same area during the whole of this\\nperiod. It is not, for instance, probable that sediment was deposited\\nduring the whole of the glacial period near the mouth of the Mississippi,\\nwithin that limit of depth at which marine animals can flourish; for we\\nknow what vast geographical changes occurred in other parts of America\\nduring this space of time. When such beds as were deposited in shallow\\nwater near the mouth of the Mississippi during some part of the glacial\\nperiod shall have been upraised, organic remains will probably first appear\\nand disappear at different levels, owing to the migration of species and to\\ngeographical changes. And in the distant future, a geologist examining\\nthese beds, might be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life\\nof the embedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period,\\ninstead of having been really far greater, that is extending from before\\nthe glacial epoch to the present day.\\n\\nIn order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper and\\nlower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have gone on\\naccumulating for a very long period, in order to have given sufficient time\\nfor the slow process of variation; hence the deposit will generally have to\\nbe a very thick one; and the species undergoing modification will have had\\nto live on the same area throughout this whole time. But we have seen that\\na thick fossiliferous formation can only be accumulated during a period of\\nsubsidence; and to keep the depth approximately the same, which is\\nnecessary in {296} order to enable the same species to live on the same\\nspace, the supply of sediment must nearly have counterbalanced the amount\\nof subsidence. But this same movement of subsidence will often tend to sink\\nthe area whence the sediment is derived, and thus diminish the supply\\nwhilst the downward movement continues. In fact, this nearly exact\\nbalancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of subsidence is\\nprobably a rare contingency; for it has been observed by more than one\\npalГ¦ontologist, that very thick deposits are usually barren of organic\\nremains, except near their upper or lower limits.\\n\\nIt would seem that each separate formation, like the whole pile of\\nformations in any country, has generally been intermittent in its\\naccumulation. When we see, as is so often the case, a formation composed of\\nbeds of different mineralogical composition, we may reasonably suspect that\\nthe process of deposition has been much interrupted, as a change in the\\ncurrents of the sea and a supply of sediment of a different nature will\\ngenerally have been due to geographical changes requiring much time. Nor\\nwill the closest inspection of a formation give any idea of the time which\\nits deposition has consumed. Many instances could be given of beds only a\\nfew feet in thickness, representing formations, elsewhere thousands of feet\\nin thickness, and which must have required an enormous period for their\\naccumulation; yet no one ignorant of this fact would have suspected the\\nvast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation. Many cases could\\nbe given of the lower beds of a formation having been upraised, denuded,\\nsubmerged, and then re-covered by the upper beds of the same\\nformation,--facts, showing what wide, yet easily overlooked, intervals have\\noccurred in its accumulation. In other cases we have the plainest evidence\\n{297} in great fossilised trees, still standing upright as they grew, of\\nmany long intervals of time and changes of level during the process of\\ndeposition, which would never even have been suspected, had not the trees\\nchanced to have been preserved: thus Messrs. Lyell and Dawson found\\ncarboniferous beds 1400 feet thick in Nova Scotia, with ancient\\nroot-bearing strata, one above the other, at no less than sixty-eight\\ndifferent levels. Hence, when the same species occur at the bottom, middle,\\nand top of a formation, the probability is that they have not lived on the\\nsame spot during the whole period of deposition, but have disappeared and\\nreappeared, perhaps many times, during the same geological period. So that\\nif such species were to undergo a considerable amount of modification\\nduring any one geological period, a section would not probably include all\\nthe fine intermediate gradations which must on my theory have existed\\nbetween them, but abrupt, though perhaps very slight, changes of form.\\n\\nIt is all-important to remember that naturalists have no golden rule by\\nwhich to distinguish species and varieties; they grant some little\\nvariability to each species, but when they meet with a somewhat greater\\namount of difference between any two forms, they rank both as species,\\nunless they are enabled to connect them together by close intermediate\\ngradations. And this from the reasons just assigned we can seldom hope to\\neffect in any one geological section. Supposing B and C to be two species,\\nand a third, A, to be found in an underlying bed; even if A were strictly\\nintermediate between B and C, it would simply be ranked as a third and\\ndistinct species, unless at the same time it could be most closely\\nconnected with either one or both forms by intermediate varieties. Nor\\nshould it be forgotten, as before explained, that A might be the actual\\nprogenitor {298} of B and C, and yet might not at all necessarily be\\nstrictly intermediate between them in all points of structure. So that we\\nmight obtain the parent-species and its several modified descendants from\\nthe lower and upper beds of a formation, and unless we obtained numerous\\ntransitional gradations, we should not recognise their relationship, and\\nshould consequently be compelled to rank them all as distinct species.\\n\\nIt is notorious on what excessively slight differences many palГ¦ontologists\\nhave founded their species; and they do this the more readily if the\\nspecimens come from different sub-stages of the same formation. Some\\nexperienced conchologists are now sinking many of the very fine species of\\nD\\'Orbigny and others into the rank of varieties; and on this view we do\\nfind the kind of evidence of change which on my theory we ought to find.\\nMoreover, if we look to rather wider intervals, namely, to distinct but\\nconsecutive stages of the same great formation, we find that the embedded\\nfossils, though almost universally ranked as specifically different, yet\\nare far more closely allied to each other than are the species found in\\nmore widely separated formations; but to this subject I shall have to\\nreturn in the following chapter.\\n\\nOne other consideration is worth notice: with animals and plants that can\\npropagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive, there is reason to\\nsuspect, as we have formerly seen, that their varieties are generally at\\nfirst local; and that such local varieties do not spread widely and\\nsupplant their parent-forms until they have been modified and perfected in\\nsome considerable degree. According to this view, the chance of discovering\\nin a formation in any one country all the early stages of transition\\nbetween any two forms, is small, for the successive changes are supposed to\\nhave been local or {299} confined to some one spot. Most marine animals\\nhave a wide range; and we have seen that with plants it is those which have\\nthe widest range, that oftenest present varieties; so that with shells and\\nother marine animals, it is probably those which have had the widest range,\\nfar exceeding the limits of the known geological formations of Europe,\\nwhich have oftenest given rise, first to local varieties and ultimately to\\nnew species; and this again would greatly lessen the chance of our being\\nable to trace the stages of transition in any one geological formation.\\n\\nIt should not be forgotten, that at the present day, with perfect specimens\\nfor examination, two forms can seldom be connected by intermediate\\nvarieties and thus proved to be the same species, until many specimens have\\nbeen collected from many places; and in the case of fossil species this\\ncould rarely be effected by palГ¦ontologists. We shall, perhaps, best\\nperceive the improbability of our being enabled to connect species by\\nnumerous, fine, intermediate, fossil links, by asking ourselves whether,\\nfor instance, geologists at some future period will be able to prove, that\\nour different breeds of cattle, sheep, horses, and dogs have descended from\\na single stock or from several aboriginal stocks; or, again, whether\\ncertain sea-shells inhabiting the shores of North America, which are ranked\\nby some conchologists as distinct species from their European\\nrepresentatives, and by other conchologists as only varieties, are really\\nvarieties or are, as it is called, specifically distinct. This could be\\neffected only by the future geologist discovering in a fossil state\\nnumerous intermediate gradations; and such success seems to me improbable\\nin the highest degree.\\n\\nGeological research, though it has added numerous species to existing and\\nextinct genera, and has made the {300} intervals between some few groups\\nless wide than they otherwise would have been, yet has done scarcely\\nanything in breaking down the distinction between species, by connecting\\nthem together by numerous, fine, intermediate varieties; and this not\\nhaving been effected, is probably the gravest and most obvious of all the\\nmany objections which may be urged against my views. Hence it will be worth\\nwhile to sum up the foregoing remarks, under an imaginary illustration. The\\nMalay Archipelago is of about the size of Europe from the North Cape to the\\nMediterranean, and from Britain to Russia; and therefore equals all the\\ngeological formations which have been examined with any accuracy, excepting\\nthose of the United States of America. I fully agree with Mr.\\nGodwin-Austen, that the present condition of the Malay Archipelago, with\\nits numerous large islands separated by wide and shallow seas, probably\\nrepresents the former state of Europe, whilst most of our formations were\\naccumulating. The Malay Archipelago is one of the richest regions of the\\nwhole world in organic beings; yet if all the species were to be collected\\nwhich have ever lived there, how imperfectly would they represent the\\nnatural history of the world!\\n\\nBut we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of the\\narchipelago would be preserved in an excessively imperfect manner in the\\nformations which we suppose to be there accumulating. I suspect that not\\nmany of the strictly littoral animals, or of those which lived on naked\\nsubmarine rocks, would be embedded; and those embedded in gravel or sand,\\nwould not endure to a distant epoch. Wherever sediment did not accumulate\\non the bed of the sea, or where it did not accumulate at a sufficient rate\\nto protect organic bodies from decay, no remains could be preserved.\\n\\nI believe that fossiliferous formations could be formed {301} in the\\narchipelago, of thickness sufficient to last to an age as distant in\\nfuturity as the secondary formations lie in the past, only during periods\\nof subsidence. These periods of subsidence would be separated from each\\nother by enormous intervals, during which the area would be either\\nstationary or rising; whilst rising, each fossiliferous formation would be\\ndestroyed, almost as soon as accumulated, by the incessant coast-action, as\\nwe now see on the shores of South America. During the periods of subsidence\\nthere would probably be much extinction of life; during the periods of\\nelevation, there would be much variation, but the geological record would\\nthen be least perfect.\\n\\nIt may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of\\nsubsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago, together with a\\ncontemporaneous accumulation of sediment, would _exceed_ the average\\nduration of the same specific forms; and these contingencies are\\nindispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations\\nbetween any two or more species. If such gradations were not fully\\npreserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many distinct\\nspecies. It is, also, probable that each great period of subsidence would\\nbe interrupted by oscillations of level, and that slight climatal changes\\nwould intervene during such lengthy periods; and in these cases the\\ninhabitants of the archipelago would have to migrate, and no closely\\nconsecutive record of their modifications could be preserved in any one\\nformation.\\n\\nVery many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range thousands\\nof miles beyond its confines; and analogy leads me to believe that it would\\nbe chiefly these far-ranging species which would oftenest produce new\\nvarieties; and the varieties would at first generally be local or confined\\nto one place, but if possessed {302} of any decided advantage, or when\\nfurther modified and improved, they would slowly spread and supplant their\\nparent-forms. When such varieties returned to their ancient homes, as they\\nwould differ from their former state, in a nearly uniform, though perhaps\\nextremely slight degree, they would, according to the principles followed\\nby many palГ¦ontologists, be ranked as new and distinct species.\\n\\nIf then, there be some degree of truth in these remarks, we have no right\\nto expect to find in our geological formations, an infinite number of those\\nfine transitional forms, which on my theory assuredly have connected all\\nthe past and present species of the same group into one long and branching\\nchain of life. We ought only to look for a few links, some more closely,\\nsome more distantly related to each other; and these links, let them be\\never so close, if found in different stages of the same formation, would,\\nby most palГ¦ontologists, be ranked as distinct species. But I do not\\npretend that I should ever have suspected how poor a record of the\\nmutations of life, the best preserved geological section presented, had not\\nthe difficulty of our not discovering innumerable transitional links\\nbetween the species which appeared at the commencement and close of each\\nformation, pressed so hardly on my theory.\\n\\n\\n\\n_On the sudden appearance of whole groups of Allied Species._--The abrupt\\nmanner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in certain\\nformations, has been urged by several palГ¦ontologists--for instance, by\\nAgassiz, Pictet, and by none more forcibly than by Professor Sedgwick--as a\\nfatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species. If numerous\\nspecies, belonging to the same genera or families, have really {303}\\nstarted into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of\\ndescent with slow modification through natural selection. For the\\ndevelopment of a group of forms, all of which have descended from some one\\nprogenitor, must have been an extremely slow process; and the progenitors\\nmust have lived long ages before their modified descendants. But we\\ncontinually over-rate the perfection of the geological record, and falsely\\ninfer, because certain genera or families have not been found beneath a\\ncertain stage, that they did not exist before that stage. We continually\\nforget how large the world is, compared with the area over which our\\ngeological formations have been carefully examined; we forget that groups\\nof species may elsewhere have long existed and have slowly multiplied\\nbefore they invaded the ancient archipelagoes of Europe and of the United\\nStates. We do not make due allowance for the enormous intervals of time,\\nwhich have probably elapsed between our consecutive formations,--longer\\nperhaps in most cases than the time required for the accumulation of each\\nformation. These intervals will have given time for the multiplication of\\nspecies from some one or some few parent-forms; and in the succeeding\\nformation such species will appear as if suddenly created.\\n\\nI may here recall a remark formerly made, namely that it might require a\\nlong succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar line\\nof life, for instance to fly through the air; but that when this had been\\neffected, and a few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other\\norganisms, a comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many\\ndivergent forms, which would be able to spread rapidly and widely\\nthroughout the world.\\n\\nI will now give a few examples to illustrate these {304} remarks, and to\\nshow how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of species\\nhave suddenly been produced. I may recall the well-known fact that in\\ngeological treatises, published not many years ago, the great class of\\nmammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement\\nof the tertiary series. And now one of the richest known accumulations of\\nfossil mammals, for its thickness, belongs to the middle of the secondary\\nseries; and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstone at\\nnearly the commencement of this great series. Cuvier used to urge that no\\nmonkey occurred in any tertiary stratum; but now extinct species have been\\ndiscovered in India, South America, and in Europe even as far back as the\\neocene stage. Had it not been for the rare accident of the preservation of\\nfootsteps in the new red sandstone of the United States, who would have\\nventured to suppose that, besides reptiles, no less than at least thirty\\nkinds of birds, some of gigantic size, existed during that period? Not a\\nfragment of bone has been discovered in these beds. Notwithstanding that\\nthe number of joints shown in the fossil impressions correspond with the\\nnumber in the several toes of living birds\\' feet, some authors doubt\\nwhether the animals which left the impressions were really birds. Until\\nquite recently these authors might have maintained, and some have\\nmaintained, that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence\\nduring an early tertiary period; but now we know, on the authority of\\nProfessor Owen (as may be seen in Lyell\\'s \\'Manual\\'), that a bird certainly\\nlived during the deposition of the upper greensand.\\n\\nI may give another instance, which from having passed under my own eyes has\\nmuch struck me. In a memoir on Fossil Sessile Cirripedes, I have stated\\nthat, from the {305} number of existing and extinct tertiary species; from\\nthe extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species all over the\\nworld, from the Arctic regions to the equator, inhabiting various zones of\\ndepths from the upper tidal limits to 50 fathoms; from the perfect manner\\nin which specimens are preserved in the oldest tertiary beds; from the ease\\nwith which even a fragment of a valve can be recognised; from all these\\ncircumstances, I inferred that had sessile cirripedes existed during the\\nsecondary periods, they would certainly have been preserved and discovered;\\nand as not one species had then been discovered in beds of this age, I\\nconcluded that this great group had been suddenly developed at the\\ncommencement of the tertiary series. This was a sore trouble to me, adding\\nas I thought one more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of\\nspecies. But my work had hardly been published, when a skilful\\npalГ¦ontologist, M. Bosquet, sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an\\nunmistakeable sessile cirripede, which he had himself extracted from the\\nchalk of Belgium. And, as if to make the case as striking as possible, this\\nsessile cirripede was a Chthamalus, a very common, large, and ubiquitous\\ngenus, of which not one specimen has as yet been found even in any tertiary\\nstratum. Hence we now positively know that sessile cirripedes existed\\nduring the secondary period; and these cirripedes might have been the\\nprogenitors of our many tertiary and existing species.\\n\\nThe case most frequently insisted on by palГ¦ontologists of the apparently\\nsudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that of the teleostean\\nfishes, low down in the Chalk period. This group includes the large\\nmajority of existing species. Lately, Professor Pictet has carried their\\nexistence one sub-stage further back; and some palГ¦ontologists believe that\\ncertain {306} much older fishes, of which the affinities are as yet\\nimperfectly known, are really teleostean. Assuming, however, that the whole\\nof them did appear, as Agassiz believes, at the commencement of the chalk\\nformation, the fact would certainly be highly remarkable; but I cannot see\\nthat it would be an insuperable difficulty on my theory, unless it could\\nlikewise be shown that the species of this group appeared suddenly and\\nsimultaneously throughout the world at this same period. It is almost\\nsuperfluous to remark that hardly any fossil-fish are known from south of\\nthe equator; and by running through Pictet\\'s PalГ¦ontology it will be seen\\nthat very few species are known from several formations in Europe. Some few\\nfamilies of fish now have a confined range; the teleostean fish might\\nformerly have had a similarly confined range, and after having been largely\\ndeveloped in some one sea, might have spread widely. Nor have we any right\\nto suppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely open from\\nsouth to north as they are at present. Even at this day, if the Malay\\nArchipelago were converted into land, the tropical parts of the Indian\\nOcean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any great\\ngroup of marine animals might be multiplied; and here they would remain\\nconfined, until some of the species became adapted to a cooler climate, and\\nwere enabled to double the southern capes of Africa or Australia, and thus\\nreach other and distant seas.\\n\\nFrom these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance of\\nthe geology of other countries beyond the confines of Europe and the United\\nStates; and from the revolution in our palГ¦ontological ideas on many\\npoints, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected,\\nit seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of\\norganic {307} beings throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist\\nto land for five minutes on some one barren point in Australia, and then to\\ndiscuss the number and range of its productions.\\n\\n\\n\\n_On the sudden appearance of groups of Allied Species in the lowest known\\nfossiliferous strata._--There is another and allied difficulty, which is\\nmuch graver. I allude to the manner in which numbers of species of the same\\ngroup, suddenly appear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks. Most of the\\narguments which have convinced me that all the existing species of the same\\ngroup have descended from one progenitor, apply with nearly equal force to\\nthe earliest known species. For instance, I cannot doubt that all the\\nSilurian trilobites have descended from some one crustacean, which must\\nhave lived long before the Silurian age, and which probably differed\\ngreatly from any known animal. Some of the most ancient Silurian animals,\\nas the Nautilus, Lingula, &c., do not differ much from living species; and\\nit cannot on my theory be supposed, that these old species were the\\nprogenitors of all the species of the orders to which they belong, for they\\ndo not present characters in any degree intermediate between them. If,\\nmoreover, they had been the progenitors of these orders, they would almost\\ncertainly have been long ago supplanted and exterminated by their numerous\\nand improved descendants.\\n\\nConsequently, if my theory be true, it is indisputable that before the\\nlowest Silurian stratum was deposited, long periods elapsed, as long as, or\\nprobably far longer than, the whole interval from the Silurian age to the\\npresent day; and that during these vast, yet quite unknown, periods of\\ntime, the world swarmed with living creatures. {308}\\n\\nTo the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial\\nperiods, I can give no satisfactory answer. Several of the most eminent\\ngeologists, with Sir E. Murchison at their head, are convinced that we see\\nin the organic remains of the lowest Silurian stratum the dawn of life on\\nthis planet. Other highly competent judges, as Lyell and the late E.\\nForbes, dispute this conclusion. We should not forget that only a small\\nportion of the world is known with accuracy. M. Barrande has lately added\\nanother and lower stage to the Silurian system, abounding with new and\\npeculiar species. Traces of life have been detected in the Longmynd beds,\\nbeneath Barrande\\'s so-called primordial zone. The presence of phosphatic\\nnodules and bituminous matter in some of the lowest azoic rocks, probably\\nindicates the former existence of life at these periods. But the difficulty\\nof understanding the absence of vast piles of fossiliferous strata, which\\non my theory no doubt were somewhere accumulated before the Silurian epoch,\\nis very great. If these most ancient beds had been wholly worn away by\\ndenudation, or obliterated by metamorphic action, we ought to find only\\nsmall remnants of the formations next succeeding them in age, and these\\nought to be very generally in a metamorphosed condition. But the\\ndescriptions which we now possess of the Silurian deposits over immense\\nterritories in Russia and in North America, do not support the view, that\\nthe older a formation is, the more it has always suffered the extremity of\\ndenudation and metamorphism.\\n\\nThe case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as a\\nvalid argument against the views here entertained. To show that it may\\nhereafter receive some explanation, I will give the following hypothesis.\\nFrom the nature of the organic remains which {309} do not appear to have\\ninhabited profound depths, in the several formations of Europe and of the\\nUnited States; and from the amount of sediment, miles in thickness, of\\nwhich the formations are composed, we may infer that from first to last\\nlarge islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was derived, occurred\\nin the neighbourhood of the existing continents of Europe and North\\nAmerica. But we do not know what was the state of things in the intervals\\nbetween the successive formations; whether Europe and the United States\\nduring these intervals existed as dry land, or as a submarine surface near\\nland, on which sediment was not deposited, or as the bed of an open and\\nunfathomable sea.\\n\\nLooking to the existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive as the land,\\nwe see them studded with many islands; but not one oceanic island is as yet\\nknown to afford even a remnant of any palГ¦ozoic or secondary formation.\\nHence we may perhaps infer, that during the palГ¦ozoic and secondary\\nperiods, neither continents nor continental islands existed where our\\noceans now extend; for had they existed there, palГ¦ozoic and secondary\\nformations would in all probability have been accumulated from sediment\\nderived from their wear and tear; and would have been at least partially\\nupheaved by the oscillations of level, which we may fairly conclude must\\nhave intervened during these enormously long periods. If then we may infer\\nanything from these facts, we may infer that where our oceans now extend,\\noceans have extended from the remotest period of which we have any record;\\nand on the other hand, that where continents now exist, large tracts of\\nland have existed, subjected no doubt to great oscillations of level, since\\nthe earliest silurian period. The coloured map appended to my volume on\\nCoral Reefs, led me to conclude that the great oceans are still mainly\\nareas of {310} subsidence, the great archipelagoes still areas of\\noscillations of level, and the continents areas of elevation. But have we\\nany right to assume that things have thus remained from the beginning of\\nthis world? Our continents seem to have been formed by a preponderance,\\nduring many oscillations of level, of the force of elevation; but may not\\nthe areas of preponderant movement have changed in the lapse of ages? At a\\nperiod immeasurably antecedent to the silurian epoch, continents may have\\nexisted where oceans are now spread out; and clear and open oceans may have\\nexisted where our continents now stand. Nor should we be justified in\\nassuming that if, for instance, the bed of the Pacific Ocean were now\\nconverted into a continent, we should there find formations older than the\\nsilurian strata, supposing such to have been formerly deposited; for it\\nmight well happen that strata which had subsided some miles nearer to the\\ncentre of the earth, and which had been pressed on by an enormous weight of\\nsuperincumbent water, might have undergone far more metamorphic action than\\nstrata which have always remained nearer to the surface. The immense areas\\nin some parts of the world, for instance in South America, of bare\\nmetamorphic rocks, which must have been heated under great pressure, have\\nalways seemed to me to require some special explanation; and we may perhaps\\nbelieve that we see in these large areas, the many formations long anterior\\nto the silurian epoch in a completely metamorphosed condition.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe several difficulties here discussed, namely our not finding in the\\nsuccessive formations infinitely numerous transitional links between the\\nmany species which now exist or have existed; the sudden manner {311} in\\nwhich whole groups of species appear in our European formations; the almost\\nentire absence, as at present known, of fossiliferous formations beneath\\nthe Silurian strata, are all undoubtedly of the gravest nature. We see this\\nin the plainest manner by the fact that all the most eminent\\npalГ¦ontologists, namely Cuvier, Agassiz, Barrande, Falconer, E. Forbes,\\n&c., and all our greatest geologists, as Lyell, Murchison, Sedgwick, &c.,\\nhave unanimously, often vehemently, maintained the immutability of species.\\nBut I have reason to believe that one great authority, Sir Charles Lyell,\\nfrom further reflexion entertains grave doubts on this subject. I feel how\\nrash it is to differ from these authorities, to whom, with others, we owe\\nall our knowledge. Those who think the natural geological record in any\\ndegree perfect, and who do not attach much weight to the facts and\\narguments of other kinds given in this volume, will undoubtedly at once\\nreject my theory. For my part, following out Lyell\\'s metaphor, I look at\\nthe natural geological record, as a history of the world imperfectly kept,\\nand written in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the last\\nvolume alone, relating only to two or three countries. Of this volume, only\\nhere and there a short chapter has been preserved; and of each page, only\\nhere and there a few lines. Each word of the slowly-changing language, in\\nwhich the history is supposed to be written, being more or less different\\nin the interrupted succession of chapters, may represent the apparently\\nabruptly changed forms of life, entombed in our consecutive, but widely\\nseparated, formations. On this view, the difficulties above discussed are\\ngreatly diminished, or even disappear.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{312}\\n\\nCHAPTER X.\\n\\nON THE GEOLOGICAL SUCCESSION OF ORGANIC BEINGS.\\n\\n    On the slow and successive appearance of new species--On their\\n    different rates of change--Species once lost do not reappear--Groups of\\n    species follow the same general rules in their appearance and\\n    disappearance as do single species--On Extinction--On simultaneous\\n    changes in the forms of life throughout the world--On the affinities of\\n    extinct species to each other and to living species--On the state of\\n    development of ancient forms--On the succession of the same types\\n    within the same areas--Summary of preceding and present chapters.\\n\\nLet us now see whether the several facts and rules relating to the\\ngeological succession of organic beings, better accord with the common view\\nof the immutability of species, or with that of their slow and gradual\\nmodification, through descent and natural selection.\\n\\nNew species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both on the land\\nand in the waters. Lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to resist the\\nevidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary stages; and every\\nyear tends to fill up the blanks between them, and to make the percentage\\nsystem of lost and new forms more gradual. In some of the most recent beds,\\nthough undoubtedly of high antiquity if measured by years, only one or two\\nspecies are lost forms, and only one or two are new forms, having here\\nappeared for the first time, either locally, or, as far as we know, on the\\nface of the earth. If we may trust the observations of Philippi in Sicily,\\nthe successive changes in the marine inhabitants of that island have been\\nmany and most gradual. The secondary formations are more broken; but, as\\nBronn has remarked, neither the appearance {313} nor disappearance of their\\nmany now extinct species has been simultaneous in each separate formation.\\n\\nSpecies of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate,\\nor in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may\\nstill be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms. Falconer has\\ngiven a striking instance of a similar fact, in an existing crocodile\\nassociated with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles in the\\nsub-Himalayan deposits. The Silurian Lingula differs but little from the\\nliving species of this genus; whereas most of the other Silurian Molluscs\\nand all the Crustaceans have changed greatly. The productions of the land\\nseem to change at a quicker rate than those of the sea, of which a striking\\ninstance has lately been observed in Switzerland. There is some reason to\\nbelieve that organisms, considered high in the scale of nature, change more\\nquickly than those that are low: though there are exceptions to this rule.\\nThe amount of organic change, as Pictet has remarked, does not strictly\\ncorrespond with the succession of our geological formations; so that\\nbetween each two consecutive formations, the forms of life have seldom\\nchanged in exactly the same degree. Yet if we compare any but the most\\nclosely related formations, all the species will be found to have undergone\\nsome change. When a species has once disappeared from the face of the\\nearth, we have reason to believe that the same identical form never\\nreappears. The strongest apparent exception to this latter rule, is that of\\nthe so-called \"colonies\" of M. Barrande, which intrude for a period in the\\nmidst of an older formation, and then allow the pre-existing fauna to\\nreappear; but Lyell\\'s explanation, namely, that it is a case of temporary\\nmigration from a distinct geographical province, seems to me satisfactory.\\n{314}\\n\\nThese several facts accord well with my theory. I believe in no fixed law\\nof development, causing all the inhabitants of a country to change\\nabruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree. The process of\\nmodification must be extremely slow. The variability of each species is\\nquite independent of that of all others. Whether such variability be taken\\nadvantage of by natural selection, and whether the variations be\\naccumulated to a greater or lesser amount, thus causing a greater or lesser\\namount of modification in the varying species, depends on many complex\\ncontingencies,--on the variability being of a beneficial nature, on the\\npower of intercrossing, on the rate of breeding, on the slowly changing\\nphysical conditions of the country, and more especially on the nature of\\nthe other inhabitants with which the varying species comes into\\ncompetition. Hence it is by no means surprising that one species should\\nretain the same identical form much longer than others; or, if changing,\\nthat it should change less. We see the same fact in geographical\\ndistribution; for instance, in the land-shells and coleopterous insects of\\nMadeira having come to differ considerably from their nearest allies on the\\ncontinent of Europe, whereas the marine shells and birds have remained\\nunaltered. We can perhaps understand the apparently quicker rate of change\\nin terrestrial and in more highly organised productions compared with\\nmarine and lower productions, by the more complex relations of the higher\\nbeings to their organic and inorganic conditions of life, as explained in a\\nformer chapter. When many of the inhabitants of a country have become\\nmodified and improved, we can understand, on the principle of competition,\\nand on that of the many all-important relations of organism to organism,\\nthat any form which does not become in some degree modified and improved,\\n{315} will be liable to be exterminated. Hence we can see why all the\\nspecies in the same region do at last, if we look to wide enough intervals\\nof time, become modified; for those which do not change will become\\nextinct.\\n\\nIn members of the same class the average amount of change, during long and\\nequal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the same; but as the\\naccumulation of long-enduring fossiliferous formations depends on great\\nmasses of sediment having been deposited on areas whilst subsiding, our\\nformations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly\\nintermittent intervals; consequently the amount of organic change exhibited\\nby the fossils embedded in consecutive formations is not equal. Each\\nformation, on this view, does not mark a new and complete act of creation,\\nbut only an occasional scene, taken almost at hazard, in a slowly changing\\ndrama.\\n\\nWe can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never\\nreappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic and inorganic,\\nshould recur. For though the offspring of one species might be adapted (and\\nno doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances) to fill the exact\\nplace of another species in the economy of nature, and thus supplant it;\\nyet the two forms--the old and the new--would not be identically the same;\\nfor both would almost certainly inherit different characters from their\\ndistinct progenitors. For instance, it is just possible, if our\\nfantail-pigeons were all destroyed, that fanciers, by striving during long\\nages for the same object, might make a new breed hardly distinguishable\\nfrom our present fantail; but if the parent rock-pigeon were also\\ndestroyed, and in nature we have every reason to believe that the\\nparent-form will generally be supplanted and exterminated by its improved\\noffspring, it is quite {316} incredible that a fantail, identical with the\\nexisting breed, could be raised from any other species of pigeon, or even\\nfrom the other well-established races of the domestic pigeon, for the\\nnewly-formed fantail would be almost sure to inherit from its new\\nprogenitor some slight characteristic differences.\\n\\nGroups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same general\\nrules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species, changing\\nmore or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser degree. A group does not\\nreappear after it has once disappeared; or its existence, as long as it\\nlasts, is continuous. I am aware that there are some apparent exceptions to\\nthis rule, but the exceptions are surprisingly few, so few that E. Forbes,\\nPictet, and Woodward (though all strongly opposed to such views as I\\nmaintain) admit its truth; and the rule strictly accords with my theory.\\nFor as all the species of the same group have descended from some one\\nspecies, it is clear that as long as any species of the group have appeared\\nin the long succession of ages, so long must its members have continuously\\nexisted, in order to have generated either new and modified or the same old\\nand unmodified forms. Species of the genus Lingula, for instance, must have\\ncontinuously existed by an unbroken succession of generations, from the\\nlowest Silurian stratum to the present day.\\n\\nWe have seen in the last chapter that the species of a group sometimes\\nfalsely appear to have come in abruptly; and I have attempted to give an\\nexplanation of this fact, which if true would have been fatal to my views.\\nBut such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being a gradual\\nincrease in number, till the group reaches its maximum, and then, sooner or\\nlater, it gradually decreases. If the number of the species of a genus, or\\nthe number of {317} the genera of a family, be represented by a vertical\\nline of varying thickness, crossing the successive geological formations in\\nwhich the species are found, the line will sometimes falsely appear to\\nbegin at its lower end, not in a sharp point, but abruptly; it then\\ngradually thickens upwards, sometimes keeping for a space of equal\\nthickness, and ultimately thins out in the upper beds, marking the decrease\\nand final extinction of the species. This gradual increase in number of the\\nspecies of a group is strictly conformable with my theory; as the species\\nof the same genus, and the genera of the same family, can increase only\\nslowly and progressively; for the process of modification and the\\nproduction of a number of allied forms must be slow and gradual,--one\\nspecies giving rise first to two or three varieties, these being slowly\\nconverted into species, which in their turn produce by equally slow steps\\nother species, and so on, like the branching of a great tree from a single\\nstem, till the group becomes large.\\n\\n\\n\\n_On Extinction._--We have as yet spoken only incidentally of the\\ndisappearance of species and of groups of species. On the theory of natural\\nselection the extinction of old forms and the production of new and\\nimproved forms are intimately connected together. The old notion of all the\\ninhabitants of the earth having been swept away at successive periods by\\ncatastrophes, is very generally given up, even by those geologists, as Elie\\nde Beaumont, Murchison, Barrande, &c, whose general views would naturally\\nlead them to this conclusion. On the contrary, we have every reason to\\nbelieve, from the study of the tertiary formations, that species and groups\\nof species gradually disappear, one after another, first from one spot,\\nthen from another, and finally from the world. Both single species and\\nwhole {318} groups of species last for very unequal periods; some groups,\\nas we have seen, having endured from the earliest known dawn of life to the\\npresent day; some having disappeared before the close of the palГ¦ozoic\\nperiod. No fixed law seems to determine the length of time during which any\\nsingle species or any single genus endures. There is reason to believe that\\nthe complete extinction of the species of a group is generally a slower\\nprocess than their production: if the appearance and disappearance of a\\ngroup of species be represented, as before, by a vertical line of varying\\nthickness, the line is found to taper more gradually at its upper end,\\nwhich marks the progress of extermination, than at its lower end, which\\nmarks the first appearance and increase in numbers of the species. In some\\ncases, however, the extermination of whole groups of beings, as of\\nammonites towards the close of the secondary period, has been wonderfully\\nsudden.\\n\\nThe whole subject of the extinction of species has been involved in the\\nmost gratuitous mystery. Some authors have even supposed that as the\\nindividual has a definite length of life, so have species a definite\\nduration. No one I think can have marvelled more at the extinction of\\nspecies, than I have done. When I found in La Plata the tooth of a horse\\nembedded with the remains of Mastodon, Megatherium, Toxodon, and other\\nextinct monsters, which all co-existed with still living shells at a very\\nlate geological period, I was filled with astonishment; for seeing that the\\nhorse, since its introduction by the Spaniards into South America, has run\\nwild over the whole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled\\nrate, I asked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former\\nhorse under conditions of life apparently so favourable. But how utterly\\ngroundless was my astonishment! {319} Professor Owen soon perceived that\\nthe tooth, though so like that of the existing horse, belonged to an\\nextinct species. Had this horse been still living, but in some degree rare,\\nno naturalist would have felt the least surprise at its rarity; for rarity\\nis the attribute of a vast number of species of all classes, in all\\ncountries. If we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare, we answer\\nthat something is unfavourable in its conditions of life; but what that\\nsomething is, we can hardly ever tell. On the supposition of the fossil\\nhorse still existing as a rare species, we might have felt certain from the\\nanalogy of all other mammals, even of the slow-breeding elephant, and from\\nthe history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in South America,\\nthat under more favourable conditions it would in a very few years have\\nstocked the whole continent. But we could not have told what the\\nunfavourable conditions were which checked its increase, whether some one\\nor several contingencies, and at what period of the horse\\'s life, and in\\nwhat degree, they severally acted. If the conditions had gone on, however\\nslowly, becoming less and less favourable, we assuredly should not have\\nperceived the fact, yet the fossil horse would certainly have become rarer\\nand rarer, and finally extinct;--its place being seized on by some more\\nsuccessful competitor.\\n\\nIt is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every living\\nbeing is constantly being checked by unperceived injurious agencies; and\\nthat these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient to cause rarity,\\nand finally extinction. We see in many cases in the more recent tertiary\\nformations, that rarity precedes extinction; and we know that this has been\\nthe progress of events with those animals which have been exterminated,\\neither locally or wholly, through {320} man\\'s agency. I may repeat what I\\npublished in 1845, namely, that to admit that species generally become rare\\nbefore they become extinct--to feel no surprise at the rarity of a species,\\nand yet to marvel greatly when it ceases to exist, is much the same as to\\nadmit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of death--to feel\\nno surprise at sickness, but when the sick man dies, to wonder and to\\nsuspect that he died by some unknown deed of violence.\\n\\nThe theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new\\nvariety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by\\nhaving some advantage over those with which it comes into competition; and\\nthe consequent extinction of less-favoured forms almost inevitably follows.\\nIt is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and slightly\\nimproved variety has been raised, it at first supplants the less improved\\nvarieties in the same neighbourhood; when much improved it is transported\\nfar and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes the place of other\\nbreeds in other countries. Thus the appearance of new forms and the\\ndisappearance of old forms, both natural and artificial, are bound\\ntogether. In certain flourishing groups, the number of new specific forms\\nwhich have been produced within a given time is probably greater than that\\nof the old specific forms which have been exterminated; but we know that\\nthe number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing, at least\\nduring the later geological periods, so that looking to later times we may\\nbelieve that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about\\nthe same number of old forms.\\n\\nThe competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained and\\nillustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like each other\\nin all respects. {321} Hence the improved and modified descendants of a\\nspecies will generally cause the extermination of the parent-species; and\\nif many new forms have been developed from any one species, the nearest\\nallies of that species, _i.e._ the species of the same genus, will be the\\nmost liable to extermination. Thus, as I believe, a number of new species\\ndescended from one species, that is a new genus, comes to supplant an old\\ngenus, belonging to the same family. But it must often have happened that a\\nnew species belonging to some one group will have seized on the place\\noccupied by a species belonging to a distinct group, and thus caused its\\nextermination; and if many allied forms be developed from the successful\\nintruder, many will have to yield their places; and it will generally be\\nallied forms, which will suffer from some inherited inferiority in common.\\nBut whether it be species belonging to the same or to a distinct class,\\nwhich yield their places to other species which have been modified and\\nimproved, a few of the sufferers may often long be preserved, from being\\nfitted to some peculiar line of life, or from inhabiting some distant and\\nisolated station, where they have escaped severe competition. For instance,\\na single species of Trigonia, a great genus of shells in the secondary\\nformations, survives in the Australian seas; and a few members of the great\\nand almost extinct group of Ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters.\\nTherefore the utter extinction of a group is generally, as we have seen, a\\nslower process than its production.\\n\\nWith respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or\\norders, as of Trilobites at the close of the palГ¦ozoic period and of\\nAmmonites at the close of the secondary period, we must remember what has\\nbeen already said on the probable wide intervals of time {322} between our\\nconsecutive formations; and in these intervals there may have been much\\nslow extermination. Moreover, when by sudden immigration or by unusually\\nrapid development, many species of a new group have taken possession of a\\nnew area, they will have exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner\\nmany of the old inhabitants; and the forms which thus yield their places\\nwill commonly be allied, for they will partake of some inferiority in\\ncommon.\\n\\nThus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and whole\\ngroups of species become extinct, accords well with the theory of natural\\nselection. We need not marvel at extinction; if we must marvel, let it be\\nat our presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand the many\\ncomplex contingencies, on which the existence of each species depends. If\\nwe forget for an instant, that each species tends to increase inordinately,\\nand that some check is always in action, yet seldom perceived by us, the\\nwhole economy of nature will be utterly obscured. Whenever we can precisely\\nsay why this species is more abundant in individuals than that; why this\\nspecies and not another can be naturalised in a given country; then, and\\nnot till then, we may justly feel surprise why we cannot account for the\\nextinction of this particular species or group of species.\\n\\n\\n\\n_On the Forms of Life changing almost simultaneously throughout the\\nWorld._--Scarcely any palГ¦ontological discovery is more striking than the\\nfact, that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the\\nworld. Thus our European Chalk formation can be recognised in many distant\\nparts of the world, under the most different climates, where not a fragment\\nof the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely, in North {323} America,\\nin equatorial South America, in Tierra del Fuego, at the Cape of Good Hope,\\nand in the peninsula of India. For at these distant points, the organic\\nremains in certain beds present an unmistakeable degree of resemblance to\\nthose of the Chalk. It is not that the same species are met with; for in\\nsome cases not one species is identically the same, but they belong to the\\nsame families, genera, and sections of genera, and sometimes are similarly\\ncharacterised in such trifling points as mere superficial sculpture.\\nMoreover other forms, which are not found in the Chalk of Europe, but which\\noccur in the formations either above or below, are similarly absent at\\nthese distant points of the world. In the several successive palГ¦ozoic\\nformations of Russia, Western Europe and North America, a similar\\nparallelism in the forms of life has been observed by several authors: so\\nit is, according to Lyell, with the several European and North American\\ntertiary deposits. Even if the few fossil species which are common to the\\nOld and New Worlds be kept wholly out of view, the general parallelism in\\nthe successive forms of life, in the stages of the widely separated\\npalГ¦ozoic and tertiary periods, would still be manifest, and the several\\nformations could be easily correlated.\\n\\nThese observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of distant\\nparts of the world: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the\\nproductions of the land and of fresh water change at distant points in the\\nsame parallel manner. We may doubt whether they have thus changed: if the\\nMegatherium, Mylodon, Macrauchenia, and Toxodon had been brought to Europe\\nfrom La Plata, without any information in regard to their geological\\nposition, no one would have suspected that they had co-existed with still\\nliving sea-shells; but as these anomalous monsters co-existed with the\\n{324} Mastodon and Horse, it might at least have been inferred that they\\nhad lived during one of the later tertiary stages.\\n\\nWhen the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed\\nsimultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this\\nexpression relates to the same thousandth or hundred-thousandth year, or\\neven that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the marine\\nanimals which live at the present day in Europe, and all those that lived\\nin Europe during the pleistocene period (an enormously remote period as\\nmeasured by years, including the whole glacial epoch), were to be compared\\nwith those now living in South America or in Australia, the most skilful\\nnaturalist would hardly be able to say whether the existing or the\\npleistocene inhabitants of Europe resembled most closely those of the\\nsouthern hemisphere. So, again, several highly competent observers believe\\nthat the existing productions of the United States are more closely related\\nto those which lived in Europe during certain later tertiary stages, than\\nto those which now live here; and if this be so, it is evident that\\nfossiliferous beds deposited at the present day on the shores of North\\nAmerica would hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older\\nEuropean beds. Nevertheless, looking to a remotely future epoch, there can,\\nI think, be little doubt that all the more modern _marine_ formations,\\nnamely, the upper pliocene, the pleistocene and strictly modern beds, of\\nEurope, North and South America, and Australia, from containing fossil\\nremains in some degree allied, and from not including those forms which are\\nonly found in the older underlying deposits, would be correctly ranked as\\nsimultaneous in a geological sense.\\n\\nThe fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously, in the above large\\nsense, at distant parts of the world, has greatly struck those admirable\\nobservers, MM. {325} de Verneuil and d\\'Archiac. After referring to the\\nparallelism of the palГ¦ozoic forms of life in various parts of Europe, they\\nadd, \"If struck by this strange sequence, we turn our attention to North\\nAmerica, and there discover a series of analogous phenomena, it will appear\\ncertain that all these modifications of species, their extinction, and the\\nintroduction of new ones, cannot be owing to mere changes in marine\\ncurrents or other causes more or less local and temporary, but depend on\\ngeneral laws which govern the whole animal kingdom.\" M. Barrande has made\\nforcible remarks to precisely the same effect. It is, indeed, quite futile\\nto look to changes of currents, climate, or other physical conditions, as\\nthe cause of these great mutations in the forms of life throughout the\\nworld, under the most different climates. We must, as Barrande has\\nremarked, look to some special law. We shall see this more clearly when we\\ntreat of the present distribution of organic beings, and find how slight is\\nthe relation between the physical conditions of various countries, and the\\nnature of their inhabitants.\\n\\nThis great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life throughout\\nthe world, is explicable on the theory of natural selection. New species\\nare formed by new varieties arising, which have some advantage over older\\nforms; and those forms, which are already dominant, or have some advantage\\nover the other forms in their own country, would naturally oftenest give\\nrise to new varieties or incipient species; for these latter must be\\nvictorious in a still higher degree in order to be preserved and to\\nsurvive. We have distinct evidence on this head, in the plants which are\\ndominant, that is, which are commonest in their own homes, and are most\\nwidely diffused, having produced the greatest number of new varieties. It\\nis also natural that the {326} dominant, varying, and far-spreading\\nspecies, which already have invaded to a certain extent the territories of\\nother species, should be those which would have the best chance of\\nspreading still further, and of giving rise in new countries to new\\nvarieties and species. The process of diffusion may often be very slow,\\nbeing dependent on climatal and geographical changes, or on strange\\naccidents, but in the long run the dominant forms will generally succeed in\\nspreading. The diffusion would, it is probable, be slower with the\\nterrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than with the marine\\ninhabitants of the continuous sea. We might therefore expect to find, as we\\napparently do find, a less strict degree of parallel succession in the\\nproductions of the land than of the sea.\\n\\nDominant species spreading from any region might encounter still more\\ndominant species, and then their triumphant course, or even their\\nexistence, would cease. We know not at all precisely what are all the\\nconditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominant\\nspecies; but we can, I think, clearly see that a number of individuals,\\nfrom giving a better chance of the appearance of favourable variations, and\\nthat severe competition with many already existing forms, would be highly\\nfavourable, as would be the power of spreading into new territories. A\\ncertain amount of isolation, recurring at long intervals of time, would\\nprobably be also favourable, as before explained. One quarter of the world\\nmay have been most favourable for the production of new and dominant\\nspecies on the land, and another for those in the waters of the sea. If two\\ngreat regions had been for a long period favourably circumstanced in an\\nequal degree, whenever their inhabitants met, the battle would be prolonged\\nand severe; and some from one birthplace and some from the other might be\\nvictorious. But in the course of time, the {327} forms dominant in the\\nhighest degree, wherever produced, would tend everywhere to prevail. As\\nthey prevailed, they would cause the extinction of other and inferior\\nforms; and as these inferior forms would be allied in groups by\\ninheritance, whole groups would tend slowly to disappear; though here and\\nthere a single member might long be enabled to survive.\\n\\nThus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense,\\nsimultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout the world,\\naccords well with the principle of new species having been formed by\\ndominant species spreading widely and varying; the new species thus\\nproduced being themselves dominant owing to inheritance, and to having\\nalready had some advantage over their parents or over other species; these\\nagain spreading, varying, and producing new species. The forms which are\\nbeaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious forms, will\\ngenerally be allied in groups, from inheriting some inferiority in common;\\nand therefore as new and improved groups spread throughout the world, old\\ngroups will disappear from the world; and the succession of forms in both\\nways will everywhere tend to correspond.\\n\\nThere is one other remark connected with this subject worth making. I have\\ngiven my reasons for believing that all our greater fossiliferous\\nformations were deposited during periods of subsidence; and that blank\\nintervals of vast duration occurred during the periods when the bed of the\\nsea was either stationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was not\\nthrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains. During\\nthese long and blank intervals I suppose that the inhabitants of each\\nregion underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction, and\\nthat there was much migration from {328} other parts of the world. As we\\nhave reason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement,\\nit is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been\\naccumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world; but we\\nare far from having any right to conclude that this has invariably been the\\ncase, and that large areas have invariably been affected by the same\\nmovements. When two formations have been deposited in two regions during\\nnearly, but not exactly the same period, we should find in both, from the\\ncauses explained in the foregoing paragraphs, the same general succession\\nin the forms of life; but the species would not exactly correspond; for\\nthere will have been a little more time in the one region than in the other\\nfor modification, extinction, and immigration.\\n\\nI suspect that cases of this nature occur in Europe. Mr. Prestwich, in his\\nadmirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of England and France, is able to\\ndraw a close general parallelism between the successive stages in the two\\ncountries; but when he compares certain stages in England with those in\\nFrance, although he finds in both a curious accordance in the numbers of\\nthe species belonging to the same genera, yet the species themselves differ\\nin a manner very difficult to account for, considering the proximity of the\\ntwo areas,--unless, indeed, it be assumed that an isthmus separated two\\nseas inhabited by distinct, but contemporaneous, faunas. Lyell has made\\nsimilar observations on some of the later tertiary formations. Barrande,\\nalso, shows that there is a striking general parallelism in the successive\\nSilurian deposits of Bohemia and Scandinavia; nevertheless he finds a\\nsurprising amount of difference in the species. If the several formations\\nin these regions have not been deposited during the same exact {329}\\nperiods,--a formation in one region often corresponding with a blank\\ninterval in the other,--and if in both regions the species have gone on\\nslowly changing during the accumulation of the several formations and\\nduring the long intervals of time between them; in this case, the several\\nformations in the two regions could be arranged in the same order, in\\naccordance with the general succession of the form of life, and the order\\nwould falsely appear to be strictly parallel; nevertheless the species\\nwould not all be the same in the apparently corresponding stages in the two\\nregions.\\n\\n\\n\\n_On the Affinities of extinct Species to each other, and to living\\nforms._--Let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living\\nspecies. They all fall into one grand natural system; and this fact is at\\nonce explained on the principle of descent. The more ancient any form is,\\nthe more, as a general rule, it differs from living forms. But, as Buckland\\nlong ago remarked, all fossils can be classed either in still existing\\ngroups, or between them. That the extinct forms of life help to fill up the\\nwide intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, cannot be\\ndisputed. For if we confine our attention either to the living or to the\\nextinct alone, the series is far less perfect than if we combine both into\\none general system. With respect to the Vertebrata, whole pages could be\\nfilled with striking illustrations from our great palaeontologist, Owen,\\nshowing how extinct animals fall in between existing groups. Cuvier ranked\\nthe Ruminants and Pachyderms, as the two most distinct orders of mammals;\\nbut Owen has discovered so many fossil links, that he has had to alter the\\nwhole classification of these two orders; and has placed certain pachyderms\\nin the same sub-order with ruminants: for example, he dissolves by fine\\ngradations the apparently {330} wide difference between the pig and the\\ncamel. In regard to the Invertebrata, Barrande, and a higher authority\\ncould not be named, asserts that he is every day taught that Palaeozoic\\nanimals, though belonging to the same orders, families, or genera with\\nthose living at the present day, were not at this early epoch limited in\\nsuch distinct groups as they now are.\\n\\nSome writers have objected to any extinct species or group of species being\\nconsidered as intermediate between living species or groups. If by this\\nterm it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate in all its\\ncharacters between two living forms, the objection is probably valid. But I\\napprehend that in a perfectly natural classification many fossil species\\nwould have to stand between living species, and some extinct genera between\\nliving genera, even between genera belonging to distinct families. The most\\ncommon case, especially with respect to very distinct groups, such as fish\\nand reptiles, seems to be, that supposing them to be distinguished at the\\npresent day from each other by a dozen characters, the ancient members of\\nthe same two groups would be distinguished by a somewhat lesser number of\\ncharacters, so that the two groups, though formerly quite distinct, at that\\nperiod made some small approach to each other.\\n\\nIt is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so much the more\\nit tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely separated\\nfrom each other. This remark no doubt must be restricted to those groups\\nwhich have undergone much change in the course of geological ages; and it\\nwould be difficult to prove the truth of the proposition, for every now and\\nthen even a living animal, as the Lepidosiren, is discovered having\\naffinities directed towards very distinct groups. Yet if we compare the\\nolder Reptiles and {331} Batrachians, the older Fish, the older\\nCephalopods, and the eocene Mammals, with the more recent members of the\\nsame classes, we must admit that there is some truth in the remark.\\n\\nLet us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the\\ntheory of descent with modification. As the subject is somewhat complex, I\\nmust request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter. We\\nmay suppose that the numbered letters represent genera, and the dotted\\nlines diverging from them the species in each genus. The diagram is much\\ntoo simple, too few genera and too few species being given, but this is\\nunimportant for us. The horizontal lines may represent successive\\ngeological formations, and all the forms beneath the uppermost line may be\\nconsidered as extinct. The three existing genera, a^{14}, q^{14}, p^{14},\\nwill form a small family; b^{14} and f^{14} a closely allied family or\\nsub-family; and o^{14}, e^{14}, m^{14}, a third family. These three\\nfamilies, together with the many extinct genera on the several lines of\\ndescent diverging from the parent-form (A), will form an order; for all\\nwill have inherited something in common from their ancient and common\\nprogenitor. On the principle of the continued tendency to divergence of\\ncharacter, which was formerly illustrated by this diagram, the more recent\\nany form is, the more it will generally differ from its ancient progenitor.\\nHence we can understand the rule that the most ancient fossils differ most\\nfrom existing forms. We must not, however, assume that divergence of\\ncharacter is a necessary contingency; it depends solely on the descendants\\nfrom a species being thus enabled to seize on many and different places in\\nthe economy of nature. Therefore it is quite possible, as we have seen in\\nthe case of some Silurian forms, that a species might go on being slightly\\nmodified in relation to its slightly altered conditions of {332} life, and\\nyet retain throughout a vast period the same general characteristics. This\\nis represented in the diagram by the letter F^{14}.\\n\\nAll the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from (A), make, as before\\nremarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects of\\nextinction and divergence of character, has become divided into several\\nsub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have perished at\\ndifferent periods, and some to have endured to the present day.\\n\\nBy looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms,\\nsupposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were discovered at\\nseveral points low down in the series, the three existing families on the\\nuppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other. If, for\\ninstance, the genera a^1, a^5, a^{10}, f^8, m^3, m^6, m^9, were\\ndisinterred, these three families would be so closely linked together that\\nthey probably would have to be united into one great family, in nearly the\\nsame manner as has occurred with ruminants and pachyderms. Yet he who\\nobjected to call the extinct genera, which thus linked the living genera of\\nthree families together, intermediate in character, would be justified, as\\nthey are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long and circuitous\\ncourse through many widely different forms. If many extinct forms were to\\nbe discovered above one of the middle horizontal lines or geological\\nformations --for instance, above No. VI.--but none from beneath this line,\\nthen only the two families on the left hand (namely, a^{14}, &c, and\\nb^{14},&c.) would have to be united into one family; and the two other\\nfamilies (namely, a^{14} to f^{14} now including five genera, and o^{14} to\\nm^{14}) would yet remain distinct. These two families, however, would be\\nless distinct from each other than they were before the discovery of the\\nfossils. If, for instance, we suppose the existing genera of the two\\nfamilies to differ from each {333} other by a dozen characters, in this\\ncase the genera, at the early period marked VI., would differ by a lesser\\nnumber of characters; for at this early stage of descent they have not\\ndiverged in character from the common progenitor of the order, nearly so\\nmuch as they subsequently diverged. Thus it comes that ancient and extinct\\ngenera are often in some slight degree intermediate in character between\\ntheir modified descendants, or between their collateral relations.\\n\\nIn nature the case will be far more complicated than is represented in the\\ndiagram; for the groups will have been more numerous, they will have\\nendured for extremely unequal lengths of time, and will have been modified\\nin various degrees. As we possess only the last volume of the geological\\nrecord, and that in a very broken condition, we have no right to expect,\\nexcept in very rare cases, to fill up wide intervals in the natural system,\\nand thus unite distinct families or orders. All that we have a right to\\nexpect, is that those groups, which have within known geological periods\\nundergone much modification, should in the older formations make some\\nslight approach to each other; so that the older members should differ less\\nfrom each other in some of their characters than do the existing members of\\nthe same groups; and this by the concurrent evidence of our best\\npalГ¦ontologists seems frequently to be the case.\\n\\nThus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts with\\nrespect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each other\\nand to living forms, seem to me explained in a satisfactory manner. And\\nthey are wholly inexplicable on any other view.\\n\\nOn this same theory, it is evident that the fauna of any great period in\\nthe earth\\'s history will be intermediate in general character between that\\nwhich preceded and that which succeeded it. Thus, the species which lived\\nat the sixth great stage of descent in the {334} diagram are the modified\\noffspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and are the parents of\\nthose which became still more modified at the seventh stage; hence they\\ncould hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character between the forms\\nof life above and below. We must, however, allow for the entire extinction\\nof some preceding forms, and in any one region for the immigration of new\\nforms from other regions, and for a large amount of modification, during\\nthe long and blank intervals between the successive formations. Subject to\\nthese allowances, the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is\\nintermediate in character, between the preceding and succeeding faunas. I\\nneed give only one instance, namely, the manner in which the fossils of the\\nDevonian system, when this system was first discovered, were at once\\nrecognised by palГ¦ontologists as intermediate in character between those of\\nthe overlying carboniferous, and underlying Silurian system. But each fauna\\nis not necessarily exactly intermediate, as unequal intervals of time have\\nelapsed between consecutive formations.\\n\\nIt is no real objection to the truth of the statement, that the fauna of\\neach period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the\\npreceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer exceptions to\\nthe rule. For instance, mastodons and elephants, when arranged by Dr.\\nFalconer in two series, first according to their mutual affinities and then\\naccording to their periods of existence, do not accord in arrangement. The\\nspecies extreme in character are not the oldest, or the most recent; nor\\nare those which are intermediate in character, intermediate in age. But\\nsupposing for an instant, in this and other such cases, that the record of\\nthe first appearance and disappearance of the species was perfect, we have\\nno reason to believe that forms successively produced necessarily endure\\nfor {335} corresponding lengths of time: a very ancient form might\\noccasionally last much longer than a form elsewhere subsequently produced,\\nespecially in the case of terrestrial productions inhabiting separated\\ndistricts. To compare small things with great: if the principal living and\\nextinct races of the domestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be\\nin serial affinity, this arrangement would not closely accord with the\\norder in time of their production, and still less with the order of their\\ndisappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon now lives; and many varieties\\nbetween the rock-pigeon and the carrier have become extinct; and carriers\\nwhich are extreme in the important character of length of beak originated\\nearlier than short-beaked tumblers, which are at the opposite end of the\\nseries in this same respect.\\n\\nClosely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from an\\nintermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character, is the\\nfact, insisted on by all palГ¦ontologists, that fossils from two consecutive\\nformations are far more closely related to each other, than are the fossils\\nfrom two remote formations. Pictet gives as a well-known instance, the\\ngeneral resemblance of the organic remains from the several stages of the\\nChalk formation, though the species are distinct in each stage. This fact\\nalone, from its generality, seems to have shaken Professor Pictet in his\\nfirm belief in the immutability of species. He who is acquainted with the\\ndistribution of existing species over the globe, will not attempt to\\naccount for the close resemblance of the distinct species in closely\\nconsecutive formations, by the physical conditions of the ancient areas\\nhaving remained nearly the same. Let it be remembered that the forms of\\nlife, at least those inhabiting the sea, have changed almost simultaneously\\nthroughout the world, and therefore under the most different climates and\\nconditions. Consider the {336} prodigious vicissitudes of climate during\\nthe pleistocene period, which includes the whole glacial period, and note\\nhow little the specific forms of the inhabitants of the sea have been\\naffected.\\n\\nOn the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fact of fossil remains\\nfrom closely consecutive formations, though ranked as distinct species,\\nbeing closely related, is obvious. As the accumulation of each formation\\nhas often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have intervened\\nbetween successive formations, we ought not to expect to find, as I\\nattempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or two formations all the\\nintermediate varieties between the species which appeared at the\\ncommencement and close of these periods; but we ought to find after\\nintervals, very long as measured by years, but only moderately long as\\nmeasured geologically, closely allied forms, or, as they have been called\\nby some authors, representative species; and these we assuredly do find. We\\nfind, in short, such evidence of the slow and scarcely sensible mutation of\\nspecific forms, as we have a just right to expect to find.\\n\\n\\n\\n_On the state of Development of Ancient Forms._--There has been much\\ndiscussion whether recent forms are more highly developed than ancient. I\\nwill not here enter on this subject, for naturalists have not as yet\\ndefined to each other\\'s satisfaction what is meant by high and low forms.\\nThe best definition probably is, that the higher forms have their organs\\nmore distinctly specialised for different functions; and as such division\\nof physiological labour seems to be an advantage to each being, natural\\nselection will constantly tend in so far to make the later and more\\nmodified forms higher than their early progenitors, or than the slightly\\nmodified descendants of such progenitors. In a more general sense the {337}\\nmore recent forms must, on my theory, be higher than the more ancient; for\\neach new species is formed by having had some advantage in the struggle for\\nlife over other and preceding forms. If under a nearly similar climate, the\\neocene inhabitants of one quarter of the world were put into competition\\nwith the existing inhabitants of the same or some other quarter, the eocene\\nfauna or flora would certainly be beaten and exterminated; as would a\\nsecondary fauna by an eocene, and a palГ¦ozoic fauna by a secondary fauna. I\\ndo not doubt that this process of improvement has affected in a marked and\\nsensible manner the organisation of the more recent and victorious forms of\\nlife, in comparison with the ancient and beaten forms; but I can see no way\\nof testing this sort of progress. Crustaceans, for instance, not the\\nhighest in their own class, may have beaten the highest molluscs. From the\\nextraordinary manner in which European productions have recently spread\\nover New Zealand, and have seized on places which must have been previously\\noccupied, we may believe, if all the animals and plants of Great Britain\\nwere set free in New Zealand, that in the course of time a multitude of\\nBritish forms would become thoroughly naturalized there, and would\\nexterminate many of the natives. On the other hand, from what we see now\\noccurring in New Zealand, and from hardly a single inhabitant of the\\nsouthern hemisphere having become wild in any part of Europe, we may doubt,\\nif all the productions of New Zealand were set free in Great Britain,\\nwhether any considerable number would be enabled to seize on places now\\noccupied by our native plants and animals. Under this point of view, the\\nproductions of Great Britain may be said to be higher than those of New\\nZealand. Yet the most skilful naturalist from an examination of the {338}\\nspecies of the two countries could not have foreseen this result.\\n\\nAgassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the\\nembryos of recent animals of the same classes; or that the geological\\nsuccession of extinct forms is in some degree parallel to the embryological\\ndevelopment of recent forms. I must follow Pictet and Huxley in thinking\\nthat the truth of this doctrine is very far from proved. Yet I fully expect\\nto see it hereafter confirmed, at least in regard to subordinate groups,\\nwhich have branched off from each other within comparatively recent times.\\nFor this doctrine of Agassiz accords well with the theory of natural\\nselection. In a future chapter I shall attempt to show that the adult\\ndiffers from its embryo, owing to variations supervening at a not early\\nage, and being inherited at a corresponding age. This process, whilst it\\nleaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of\\nsuccessive generations, more and more difference to the adult.\\n\\nThus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature,\\nof the ancient and less modified condition of each animal. This view may be\\ntrue, and yet it may never be capable of full proof. Seeing, for instance,\\nthat the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fish strictly belong to their\\nown proper classes, though some of these old forms are in a slight degree\\nless distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same\\ngroups at the present day, it would be vain to look for animals having the\\ncommon embryological character of the Vertebrata, until beds far beneath\\nthe lowest Silurian strata are discovered--a discovery of which the chance\\nis very small.\\n\\n\\n\\n_On the Succession of the same Types within the same {339} areas, during\\nthe later tertiary periods._--Mr. Clift many years ago showed that the\\nfossil mammals from the Australian caves were closely allied to the living\\nmarsupials of that continent. In South America, a similar relationship is\\nmanifest, even to an uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour like\\nthose of the armadillo, found in several parts of La Plata; and Professor\\nOwen has shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals,\\nburied there in such numbers, are related to South American types. This\\nrelationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of\\nfossil bones made by MM. Lund and Clausen in the caves of Brazil. I was so\\nmuch impressed with these facts that I strongly insisted, in 1839 and 1845,\\non this \"law of the succession of types,\"--on \"this wonderful relationship\\nin the same continent between the dead and the living.\" Professor Owen has\\nsubsequently extended the same generalisation to the mammals of the Old\\nWorld. We see the same law in this author\\'s restorations of the extinct and\\ngigantic birds of New Zealand. We see it also in the birds of the caves of\\nBrazil. Mr. Woodward has shown that the same law holds good with\\nsea-shells, but from the wide distribution of most genera of molluscs, it\\nis not well displayed by them. Other cases could be added, as the relation\\nbetween the extinct and living land-shells of Madeira; and between the\\nextinct and living brackish-water shells of the Aralo-Caspian Sea.\\n\\nNow what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types\\nwithin the same areas mean? He would be a bold man, who after comparing the\\npresent climate of Australia and of parts of South America under the same\\nlatitude, would attempt to account, on the one hand, by dissimilar physical\\nconditions for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of these two\\ncontinents, {340} and, on the other hand, by similarity of conditions, for\\nthe uniformity of the same types in each during the later tertiary periods.\\nNor can it be pretended that it is an immutable law that marsupials should\\nhave been chiefly or solely produced in Australia; or that Edentata and\\nother American types should have been solely produced in South America. For\\nwe know that Europe in ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials;\\nand I have shown in the publications above alluded to, that in America the\\nlaw of distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what\\nit now is. North America formerly partook strongly of the present character\\nof the southern half of the continent; and the southern half was formerly\\nmore closely allied, than it is at present, to the northern half. In a\\nsimilar manner we know from Falconer and Cautley\\'s discoveries, that\\nnorthern India was formerly more closely related in its mammals to Africa\\nthan it is at the present time. Analogous facts could be given in relation\\nto the distribution of marine animals.\\n\\nOn the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the long\\nenduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types within the same\\nareas, is at once explained; for the inhabitants of each quarter of the\\nworld will obviously tend to leave in that quarter, during the next\\nsucceeding period of time, closely allied though in some degree modified\\ndescendants. If the inhabitants of one continent formerly differed greatly\\nfrom those of another continent, so will their modified descendants still\\ndiffer in nearly the same manner and degree. But after very long intervals\\nof time and after great geographical changes, permitting much\\ninter-migration, the feebler will yield to the more dominant forms, and\\nthere will be nothing immutable in the laws of past and present\\ndistribution. {341}\\n\\nIt may be asked in ridicule, whether I suppose that the megatherium and\\nother allied huge monsters have left behind them in South America, the\\nsloth, armadillo, and anteater, as their degenerate descendants. This\\ncannot for an instant be admitted. These huge animals have become wholly\\nextinct, and have left no progeny. But in the caves of Brazil, there are\\nmany extinct species which are closely allied in size and in other\\ncharacters to the species still living in South America; and some of these\\nfossils may be the actual progenitors of living species. It must not be\\nforgotten that, on my theory, all the species of the same genus have\\ndescended from some one species; so that if six genera, each having eight\\nspecies, be found in one geological formation, and in the next succeeding\\nformation there be six other allied or representative genera with the same\\nnumber of species, then we may conclude that only one species of each of\\nthe six older genera has left modified descendants, constituting the six\\nnew genera. The other seven species of the old genera have all died out and\\nhave left no progeny. Or, which would probably be a far commoner case, two\\nor three species of two or three alone of the six older genera will have\\nbeen the parents of the six new genera; the other old species and the other\\nwhole old genera having become utterly extinct. In failing orders, with the\\ngenera and species decreasing in numbers, as apparently is the case of the\\nEdentata of South America, still fewer genera and species will have left\\nmodified blood-descendants.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Summary of the preceding and present Chapters._--I have attempted to show\\nthat the geological record is extremely imperfect; that only a small\\nportion of the globe has been geologically explored with care; that {342}\\nonly certain classes of organic beings have been largely preserved in a\\nfossil state; that the number both of specimens and of species, preserved\\nin our museums, is absolutely as nothing compared with the incalculable\\nnumber of generations which must have passed away even during a single\\nformation; that, owing to subsidence being necessary for the accumulation\\nof fossiliferous deposits thick enough to resist future degradation,\\nenormous intervals of time have elapsed between the successive formations;\\nthat there has probably been more extinction during the periods of\\nsubsidence, and more variation during the periods of elevation, and during\\nthe latter the record will have been least perfectly kept; that each single\\nformation has not been continuously deposited; that the duration of each\\nformation is, perhaps, short compared with the average duration of specific\\nforms; that migration has played an important part in the first appearance\\nof new forms in any one area and formation; that widely ranging species are\\nthose which have varied most, and have oftenest given rise to new species;\\nand that varieties have at first often been local. All these causes taken\\nconjointly, must have tended to make the geological record extremely\\nimperfect, and will to a large extent explain why we do not find\\ninterminable varieties, connecting together all the extinct and existing\\nforms of life by the finest graduated steps.\\n\\nHe who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record, will\\nrightly reject my whole theory. For he may ask in vain where are the\\nnumberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the\\nclosely allied or representative species, found in the several stages of\\nthe same great formation. He may disbelieve in the enormous intervals of\\ntime which have elapsed between our consecutive formations; he {343} may\\noverlook how important a part migration must have played, when the\\nformations of any one great region alone, as that of Europe, are\\nconsidered; he may urge the apparent, but often falsely apparent, sudden\\ncoming in of whole groups of species. He may ask where are the remains of\\nthose infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the\\nfirst bed of the Silurian system was deposited: I can answer this latter\\nquestion only hypothetically, by saying that as far as we can see, where\\nour oceans now extend they have for an enormous period extended, and where\\nour oscillating continents now stand they have stood ever since the\\nSilurian epoch; but that long before that period, the world may have\\npresented a wholly different aspect; and that the older continents, formed\\nof formations older than any known to us, may now all be in a metamorphosed\\ncondition, or may lie buried under the ocean.\\n\\nPassing from these difficulties, all the other great leading facts in\\npalГ¦ontology seem to me simply to follow on the theory of descent with\\nmodification through natural selection. We can thus understand how it is\\nthat new species come in slowly and successively; how species of different\\nclasses do not necessarily change together, or at the same rate, or in the\\nsame degree; yet in the long run that all undergo modification to some\\nextent. The extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of\\nthe production of new forms. We can understand why when a species has once\\ndisappeared it never reappears. Groups of species increase in numbers\\nslowly, and endure for unequal periods of time; for the process of\\nmodification is necessarily slow, and depends on many complex\\ncontingencies. The dominant species of the larger dominant groups tend to\\nleave many modified {344} descendants, and thus new sub-groups and groups\\nare formed. As these are formed, the species of the less vigorous groups,\\nfrom their inferiority inherited from a common progenitor, tend to become\\nextinct together, and to leave no modified offspring on the face of the\\nearth. But the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a\\nvery slow process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in\\nprotected and isolated situations. When a group has once wholly\\ndisappeared, it does not reappear; for the link of generation has been\\nbroken.\\n\\nWe can understand how the spreading of the dominant forms of life, which\\nare those that oftenest vary, will in the long run tend to people the world\\nwith allied, but modified, descendants; and these will generally succeed in\\ntaking the places of those groups of species which are their inferiors in\\nthe struggle for existence. Hence, after long intervals of time, the\\nproductions of the world will appear to have changed simultaneously.\\n\\nWe can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and recent,\\nmake together one grand system; for all are connected by generation. We can\\nunderstand, from the continued tendency to divergence of character, why the\\nmore ancient a form is, the more it generally differs from those now\\nliving. Why ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between\\nexisting forms, sometimes blending two groups previously classed as\\ndistinct into one; but more commonly only bringing them a little closer\\ntogether. The more ancient a form is, the more often, apparently, it\\ndisplays characters in some degree intermediate between groups now\\ndistinct; for the more ancient a form is, the more nearly it will be\\nrelated to, and consequently resemble, the common progenitor of groups,\\nsince {345} become widely divergent. Extinct forms are seldom directly\\nintermediate between existing forms; but are intermediate only by a long\\nand circuitous course through many extinct and very different forms. We can\\nclearly see why the organic remains of closely consecutive formations are\\nmore closely allied to each other, than are those of remote formations; for\\nthe forms are more closely linked together by generation: we can clearly\\nsee why the remains of an intermediate formation are intermediate in\\ncharacter.\\n\\nThe inhabitants of each successive period in the world\\'s history have\\nbeaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, in so far, higher\\nin the scale of nature; and this may account for that vague yet ill-defined\\nsentiment, felt by many palГ¦ontologists, that organisation on the whole has\\nprogressed. If it should hereafter be proved that ancient animals resemble\\nto a certain extent the embryos of more recent animals of the same class,\\nthe fact will be intelligible. The succession of the same types of\\nstructure within the same areas during the later geological periods ceases\\nto be mysterious, and is simply explained by inheritance.\\n\\nIf then the geological record be as imperfect as I believe it to be, and it\\nmay at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much more\\nperfect, the main objections to the theory of natural selection are greatly\\ndiminished or disappear. On the other hand, all the chief laws of\\npalГ¦ontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me, that species have been\\nproduced by ordinary generation: old forms having been supplanted by new\\nand improved forms of life, produced by the laws of variation still acting\\nround us, and preserved by Natural Selection.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{346}\\n\\nCHAPTER XI.\\n\\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.\\n\\n    Present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical\\n    conditions--Importance of barriers--Affinity of the productions of the\\n    same continent--Centres of creation--Means of dispersal, by changes of\\n    climate and of the level of the land, and by occasional\\n    means--Dispersal during the Glacial period co-extensive with the world.\\n\\nIn considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of the\\nglobe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that neither the\\nsimilarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions can\\nbe accounted for by their climatal and other physical conditions. Of late,\\nalmost every author who has studied the subject has come to this\\nconclusion. The case of America alone would almost suffice to prove its\\ntruth: for if we exclude the northern parts where the circumpolar land is\\nalmost continuous, all authors agree that one of the most fundamental\\ndivisions in geographical distribution is that between the New and Old\\nWorlds; yet if we travel over the vast American continent, from the central\\nparts of the United States to its extreme southern point, we meet with the\\nmost diversified conditions; the most humid districts, arid deserts, lofty\\nmountains, grassy plains, forests, marshes, lakes, and great rivers, under\\nalmost every temperature. There is hardly a climate or condition in the Old\\nWorld which cannot be paralleled in the New--at least as closely as the\\nsame species generally require; for it is a most rare case to find a group\\nof organisms confined to any small spot, having conditions peculiar in only\\na slight {347} degree; for instance, small areas in the Old World could be\\npointed out hotter than any in the New World, yet these are not inhabited\\nby a peculiar fauna or flora. Notwithstanding this parallelism in the\\nconditions of the Old and New Worlds, how widely different are their living\\nproductions!\\n\\nIn the southern hemisphere, if we compare large tracts of land in\\nAustralia, South Africa, and western South America, between latitudes 25В°\\nand 35В°, we shall find parts extremely similar in all their conditions, yet\\nit would not be possible to point out three faunas and floras more utterly\\ndissimilar. Or again we may compare the productions of South America south\\nof lat. 35В° with those north of 25В°, which consequently inhabit a\\nconsiderably different climate, and they will be found incomparably more\\nclosely related to each other, than they are to the productions of\\nAustralia or Africa under nearly the same climate. Analogous facts could be\\ngiven with respect to the inhabitants of the sea.\\n\\nA second great fact which strikes us in our general review is, that\\nbarriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a\\nclose and important manner to the differences between the productions of\\nvarious regions. We see this in the great difference of nearly all the\\nterrestrial productions of the New and Old Worlds, excepting in the\\nnorthern parts, where the land almost joins, and where, under a slightly\\ndifferent climate, there might have been free migration for the northern\\ntemperate forms, as there now is for the strictly arctic productions. We\\nsee the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants of\\nAustralia, Africa, and South America under the same latitude: for these\\ncountries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible. On\\neach continent, also, we see the same fact; for on the opposite sides of\\n{348} lofty and continuous mountain-ranges, and of great deserts, and\\nsometimes even of large rivers, we find different productions; though as\\nmountain-chains, deserts, &c., are not as impassable, or likely to have\\nendured so long as the oceans separating continents, the differences are\\nvery inferior in degree to those characteristic of distinct continents.\\n\\nTurning to the sea, we find the same law. No two marine faunas are more\\ndistinct, with hardly a fish, shell, or crab in common, than those of the\\neastern and western shores of South and Central America; yet these great\\nfaunas are separated only by the narrow, but impassable, isthmus of Panama.\\nWestward of the shores of America, a wide space of open ocean extends, with\\nnot an island as a halting-place for emigrants; here we have a barrier of\\nanother kind, and as soon as this is passed we meet in the eastern islands\\nof the Pacific, with another and totally distinct fauna. So that here three\\nmarine faunas range far northward and southward, in parallel lines not far\\nfrom each other, under corresponding climates; but from being separated\\nfrom each other by impassable barriers, either of land or open sea, they\\nare wholly distinct. On the other hand, proceeding still further westward\\nfrom the eastern islands of the tropical parts of the Pacific, we encounter\\nno impassable barriers, and we have innumerable islands as halting-places,\\nor continuous coasts, until after travelling over a hemisphere we come to\\nthe shores of Africa; and over this vast space we meet with no well-defined\\nand distinct marine faunas. Although hardly one shell, crab or fish is\\ncommon to the above-named three approximate faunas of Eastern and Western\\nAmerica and the eastern Pacific islands, yet many fish range from the\\nPacific into the Indian Ocean, and many shells are common to the eastern\\nislands of the Pacific {349} and the eastern shores of Africa, on almost\\nexactly opposite meridians of longitude.\\n\\nA third great fact, partly included in the foregoing statements, is the\\naffinity of the productions of the same continent or sea, though the\\nspecies themselves are distinct at different points and stations. It is a\\nlaw of the widest generality, and every continent offers innumerable\\ninstances. Nevertheless the naturalist in travelling, for instance, from\\nnorth to south never fails to be struck by the manner in which successive\\ngroups of beings, specifically distinct, yet clearly related, replace each\\nother. He hears from closely allied, yet distinct kinds of birds, notes\\nnearly similar, and sees their nests similarly constructed, but not quite\\nalike, with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner. The plains near the\\nStraits of Magellan are inhabited by one species of Rhea (American\\nostrich), and northward the plains of La Plata by another species of the\\nsame genus; and not by a true ostrich or emu, like those found in Africa\\nand Australia under the same latitude. On these same plains of La Plata, we\\nsee the agouti and bizcacha, animals having nearly the same habits as our\\nhares and rabbits and belonging to the same order of Rodents, but they\\nplainly display an American type of structure. We ascend the lofty peaks of\\nthe Cordillera and we find an alpine species of bizcacha; we look to the\\nwaters, and we do not find the beaver or musk-rat, but the coypu and\\ncapybara, rodents of the American type. Innumerable other instances could\\nbe given. If we look to the islands off the American shore, however much\\nthey may differ in geological structure, the inhabitants, though they may\\nbe all peculiar species, are essentially American. We may look back to past\\nages, as shown in the last chapter, and we find American types then\\nprevalent on {350} the American continent and in the American seas. We see\\nin these facts some deep organic bond, prevailing throughout space and\\ntime, over the same areas of land and water, and independent of their\\nphysical conditions. The naturalist must feel little curiosity, who is not\\nled to inquire what this bond is.\\n\\nThis bond, on my theory, is simply inheritance, that cause which alone, as\\nfar as we positively know, produces organisms quite like, or, as we see in\\nthe case of varieties, nearly like each other. The dissimilarity of the\\ninhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification through\\nnatural selection, and in a quite subordinate degree to the direct\\ninfluence of different physical conditions. The degree of dissimilarity\\nwill depend on the migration of the more dominant forms of life from one\\nregion into another having been effected with more or less ease, at periods\\nmore or less remote;--on the nature and number of the former\\nimmigrants;--and on their action and reaction, in their mutual struggles\\nfor life;--the relation of organism to organism being, as I have already\\noften remarked, the most important of all relations. Thus the high\\nimportance of barriers comes into play by checking migration; as does time\\nfor the slow process of modification through natural selection.\\nWidely-ranging species, abounding in individuals, which have already\\ntriumphed over many competitors in their own widely-extended homes will\\nhave the best chance of seizing on new places, when they spread into new\\ncountries. In their new homes they will be exposed to new conditions, and\\nwill frequently undergo further modification and improvement; and thus they\\nwill become still further victorious, and will produce groups of modified\\ndescendants. On this principle of inheritance with modification, we can\\nunderstand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, {351} and even\\nfamilies are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously\\nthe case.\\n\\nI believe, as was remarked in the last chapter, in no law of necessary\\ndevelopment. As the variability of each species is an independent property,\\nand will be taken advantage of by natural selection, only so far as it\\nprofits the individual in its complex struggle for life, so the degree of\\nmodification in different species will be no uniform quantity. If, for\\ninstance, a number of species, which stand in direct competition with each\\nother, migrate in a body into a new and afterwards isolated country, they\\nwill be little liable to modification; for neither migration nor isolation\\nin themselves can do anything. These principles come into play only by\\nbringing organisms into new relations with each other, and in a lesser\\ndegree with the surrounding physical conditions. As we have seen in the\\nlast chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character from\\nan enormously remote geological period, so certain species have migrated\\nover vast spaces, and have not become greatly modified.\\n\\nOn these views, it is obvious, that the several species of the same genus,\\nthough inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world, must originally\\nhave proceeded from the same source, as they have descended from the same\\nprogenitor. In the case of those species, which have undergone during whole\\ngeological periods but little modification, there is not much difficulty in\\nbelieving that they may have migrated from the same region; for during the\\nvast geographical and climatal changes which will have supervened since\\nancient times, almost any amount of migration is possible. But in many\\nother cases, in which we have reason to believe that the species of a genus\\nhave been produced within comparatively recent times, there is great\\ndifficulty on this head. It {352} is also obvious that the individuals of\\nthe same species, though now inhabiting distant and isolated regions, must\\nhave proceeded from one spot, where their parents were first produced: for,\\nas explained in the last chapter, it is incredible that individuals\\nidentically the same should ever have been produced through natural\\nselection from parents specifically distinct.\\n\\nWe are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by\\nnaturalists, namely, whether species have been created at one or more\\npoints of the earth\\'s surface. Undoubtedly there are very many cases of\\nextreme difficulty, in understanding how the same species could possibly\\nhave migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated\\npoints, where now found. Nevertheless the simplicity of the view that each\\nspecies was first produced within a single region captivates the mind. He\\nwho rejects it, rejects the _vera causa_ of ordinary generation with\\nsubsequent migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle. It is\\nuniversally admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a species is\\ncontinuous; and when a plant or animal inhabits two points so distant from\\neach other, or with an interval of such a nature, that the space could not\\nbe easily passed over by migration, the fact is given as something\\nremarkable and exceptional. The capacity of migrating across the sea is\\nmore distinctly limited in terrestrial mammals, than perhaps in any other\\norganic beings; and, accordingly, we find no inexplicable cases of the same\\nmammal inhabiting distant points of the world. No geologist will feel any\\ndifficulty in such cases as Great Britain having been formerly united to\\nEurope, and consequently possessing the same quadrupeds. But if the same\\nspecies can be produced at two separate points, why do we not find a single\\nmammal common to Europe and {353} Australia or South America? The\\nconditions of life are nearly the same, so that a multitude of European\\nanimals and plants have become naturalised in America and Australia; and\\nsome of the aboriginal plants are identically the same at these distant\\npoints of the northern and southern hemispheres? The answer, as I believe,\\nis, that mammals have not been able to migrate, whereas some plants, from\\ntheir varied means of dispersal, have migrated across the vast and broken\\ninterspace. The great and striking influence which barriers of every kind\\nhave had on distribution, is intelligible only on the view that the great\\nmajority of species have been produced on one side alone, and have not been\\nable to migrate to the other side. Some few families, many sub-families,\\nvery many genera, and a still greater number of sections of genera are\\nconfined to a single region; and it has been observed by several\\nnaturalists, that the most natural genera, or those genera in which the\\nspecies are most closely related to each other, are generally local, or\\nconfined to one area. What a strange anomaly it would be, if, when coming\\none step lower in the series, to the individuals of the same species, a\\ndirectly opposite rule prevailed; and species were not local, but had been\\nproduced in two or more distinct areas!\\n\\nHence it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the view of\\neach species having been produced in one area alone, and having\\nsubsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration and\\nsubsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most\\nprobable. Undoubtedly many cases occur, in which we cannot explain how the\\nsame species could have passed from one point to the other. But the\\ngeographical and climatal changes, which have certainly occurred within\\nrecent geological times, must have interrupted or rendered discontinuous\\nthe {354} formerly continuous range of many species. So that we are reduced\\nto consider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous\\nand of so grave a nature, that we ought to give up the belief, rendered\\nprobable by general considerations, that each species has been produced\\nwithin one area, and has migrated thence as far as it could. It would be\\nhopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same\\nspecies, now living at distant and separated points; nor do I for a moment\\npretend that any explanation could be offered of many such cases. But after\\nsome preliminary remarks, I will discuss a few of the most striking classes\\nof facts; namely, the existence of the same species on the summits of\\ndistant mountain-ranges, and at distant points in the arctic and antarctic\\nregions; and secondly (in the following chapter), the wide distribution of\\nfreshwater productions; and thirdly, the occurrence of the same terrestrial\\nspecies on islands and on the mainland, though separated by hundreds of\\nmiles of open sea. If the existence of the same species at distant and\\nisolated points of the earth\\'s surface, can in many instances be explained\\non the view of each species having migrated from a single birthplace; then,\\nconsidering our ignorance with respect to former climatal and geographical\\nchanges and various occasional means of transport, the belief that this has\\nbeen the universal law, seems to me incomparably the safest.\\n\\nIn discussing this subject, we shall be enabled at the same time to\\nconsider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the several\\ndistinct species of a genus, which on my theory have all descended from a\\ncommon progenitor, can have migrated (undergoing modification during some\\npart of their migration) from the area inhabited by their progenitor. If it\\ncan be shown to be almost invariably the case, that a region, of which\\n{355} most of its inhabitants are closely related to, or belong to the same\\ngenera with the species of a second region, has probably received at some\\nformer period immigrants from this other region, my theory will be\\nstrengthened; for we can clearly understand, on the principle of\\nmodification, why the inhabitants of a region should be related to those of\\nanother region, whence it has been stocked. A volcanic island, for\\ninstance, upheaved and formed at the distance of a few hundreds of miles\\nfrom a continent, would probably receive from it in the course of time a\\nfew colonists, and their descendants, though modified, would still be\\nplainly related by inheritance to the inhabitants of the continent. Cases\\nof this nature are common, and are, as we shall hereafter more fully see,\\ninexplicable on the theory of independent creation. This view of the\\nrelation of species in one region to those in another, does not differ much\\n(by substituting the word variety for species) from that lately advanced in\\nan ingenious paper by Mr. Wallace, in which he concludes, that \"every\\nspecies has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a\\npre-existing closely allied species.\" And I now know from correspondence,\\nthat this coincidence he attributes to generation with modification.\\n\\nThe previous remarks on \"single and multiple centres of creation\" do not\\ndirectly bear on another allied question,--namely whether all the\\nindividuals of the same species have descended from a single pair, or\\nsingle hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many\\nindividuals simultaneously created. With those organic beings which never\\nintercross (if such exist), the species, on my theory, must have descended\\nfrom a succession of improved varieties, which will never have blended with\\nother individuals or varieties, but will have supplanted each other; so\\nthat, at each {356} successive stage of modification and improvement, all\\nthe individuals of each variety will have descended from a single parent.\\nBut in the majority of cases, namely, with all organisms which habitually\\nunite for each birth, or which often intercross, I believe that during the\\nslow process of modification the individuals of the species will have been\\nkept nearly uniform by intercrossing; so that many individuals will have\\ngone on simultaneously changing, and the whole amount of modification will\\nnot have been due, at each stage, to descent from a single parent. To\\nillustrate what I mean: our English racehorses differ slightly from the\\nhorses of every other breed; but they do not owe their difference and\\nsuperiority to descent from any single pair, but to continued care in\\nselecting and training many individuals during many generations.\\n\\nBefore discussing the three classes of facts, which I have selected as\\npresenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of \"single\\ncentres of creation,\" I must say a few words on the means of dispersal.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Means of Dispersal._--Sir C. Lyell and other authors have ably treated\\nthis subject. I can give here only the briefest abstract of the more\\nimportant facts. Change of climate must have had a powerful influence on\\nmigration: a region when its climate was different may have been a high\\nroad for migration, but now be impassable; I shall, however, presently have\\nto discuss this branch of the subject in some detail. Changes of level in\\nthe land must also have been highly influential: a narrow isthmus now\\nseparates two marine faunas; submerge it, or let it formerly have been\\nsubmerged, and the two faunas will now blend or may formerly have blended:\\nwhere the sea now extends, land may at a former period have connected\\nislands or {357} possibly even continents together, and thus have allowed\\nterrestrial productions to pass from one to the other. No geologist will\\ndispute that great mutations of level have occurred within the period of\\nexisting organisms. Edward Forbes insisted that all the islands in the\\nAtlantic must recently have been connected with Europe or Africa, and\\nEurope likewise with America. Other authors have thus hypothetically\\nbridged over every ocean, and have united almost every island to some\\nmainland. If indeed the arguments used by Forbes are to be trusted, it must\\nbe admitted that scarcely a single island exists which has not recently\\nbeen united to some continent. This view cuts the Gordian knot of the\\ndispersal of the same species to the most distant points, and removes many\\na difficulty: but to the best of my judgment we are not authorized in\\nadmitting such enormous geographical changes within the period of existing\\nspecies. It seems to me that we have abundant evidence of great\\noscillations of level in our continents; but not of such vast changes in\\ntheir position and extension, as to have united them within the recent\\nperiod to each other and to the several intervening oceanic islands. I\\nfreely admit the former existence of many islands, now buried beneath the\\nsea, which may have served as halting places for plants and for many\\nanimals during their migration. In the coral-producing oceans such sunken\\nislands are now marked, as I believe, by rings of coral or atolls standing\\nover them. Whenever it is fully admitted, as I believe it will some day be,\\nthat each species has proceeded from a single birthplace, and when in the\\ncourse of time we know something definite about the means of distribution,\\nwe shall be enabled to speculate with security on the former extension of\\nthe land. But I do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the\\n{358} recent period continents which are now quite separate, have been\\ncontinuously, or almost continuously, united with each other, and with the\\nmany existing oceanic islands. Several facts in distribution,--such as the\\ngreat difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every\\ncontinent,--the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands\\nand even seas to their present inhabitants,--a certain degree of relation\\n(as we shall hereafter see) between the distribution of mammals and the\\ndepth of the sea,--these and other such facts seem to me opposed to the\\nadmission of such prodigious geographical revolutions within the recent\\nperiod, as are necessitated on the view advanced by Forbes and admitted by\\nhis many followers. The nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants\\nof oceanic islands likewise seem to me opposed to the belief of their\\nformer continuity with continents. Nor does their almost universally\\nvolcanic composition favour the admission that they are the wrecks of\\nsunken continents;--if they had originally existed as mountain-ranges on\\nthe land, some at least of the islands would have been formed, like other\\nmountain-summits, of granite, metamorphic schists, old fossiliferous or\\nother such rocks, instead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter.\\n\\nI must now say a few words on what are called accidental means, but which\\nmore properly might be called occasional means of distribution. I shall\\nhere confine myself to plants. In botanical works, this or that plant is\\nstated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination; but for transport across\\nthe sea, the greater or less facilities may be said to be almost wholly\\nunknown. Until I tried, with Mr. Berkeley\\'s aid, a few experiments, it was\\nnot even known how far seeds could resist the injurious action of\\nsea-water. To my surprise I found that {359} out of 87 kinds, 64 germinated\\nafter an immersion of 28 days, and a few survived an immersion of 137 days.\\nFor convenience\\' sake I chiefly tried small seeds, without the capsule or\\nfruit; and as all of these sank in a few days, they could not be floated\\nacross wide spaces of the sea, whether or not they were injured by the\\nsalt-water. Afterwards I tried some larger fruits, capsules, &c., and some\\nof these floated for a long time. It is well known what a difference there\\nis in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber; and it occurred to me that\\nfloods might wash down plants or branches, and that these might be dried on\\nthe banks, and then by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea.\\nHence I was led to dry stems and branches of 94 plants with ripe fruit, and\\nto place them on sea-water. The majority sank quickly, but some which\\nwhilst green floated for a very short time, when dried floated much longer;\\nfor instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried they floated\\nfor 90 days, and afterwards when planted they germinated; an asparagus\\nplant with ripe berries floated for 23 days, when dried it floated for 85\\ndays, and the seeds afterwards germinated; the ripe seeds of Helosciadium\\nsank in two days, when dried they floated for above 90 days, and afterwards\\ngerminated. Altogether out of the 94 dried plants, 18 floated for above 28\\ndays, and some of the 18 floated for a very much longer period. So that as\\n64/87 seeds germinated after an immersion of 28 days; and as 18/94 plants\\nwith ripe fruit (but not all the same species as in the foregoing\\nexperiment) floated, after being dried, for above 28 days, as far as we may\\ninfer anything from these scanty facts, we may conclude that the seeds of\\n14/100 plants of any country might be floated by sea-currents during 28\\ndays, and would retain their power of germination. In Johnston\\'s Physical\\nAtlas, the average {360} rate of the several Atlantic currents is 33 miles\\nper diem (some currents running at the rate of 60 miles per diem); on this\\naverage, the seeds of 14/100 plants belonging to one country might be\\nfloated across 924 miles of sea to another country; and when stranded, if\\nblown to a favourable spot by an inland gale, they would germinate.\\n\\nSubsequently to my experiments, M. Martens tried similar ones, but in a\\nmuch better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea, so\\nthat they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really floating\\nplants. He tried 98 seeds, mostly different from mine; but he chose many\\nlarge fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live near the sea; and\\nthis would have favoured the average length of their flotation and of their\\nresistance to the injurious action of the salt-water. On the other hand he\\ndid not previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit; and this, as\\nwe have seen, would have caused some of them to have floated much longer.\\nThe result was that 18/98 of his seeds floated for 42 days, and were then\\ncapable of germination. But I do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves\\nwould float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as\\nin our experiments. Therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the\\nseeds of about 10/100 plants of a flora, after having been dried, could be\\nfloated across a space of sea 900 miles in width, and would then germinate.\\nThe fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small, is\\ninteresting; as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be\\ntransported by any other means; and Alph. de Candolle has shown that such\\nplants generally have restricted ranges.\\n\\nBut seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. Drift timber\\nis thrown up on most islands, {361} even on those in the midst of the\\nwidest oceans; and the natives of the coral-islands in the Pacific, procure\\nstones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees, these\\nstones being a valuable royal tax. I find on examination, that when\\nirregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees, small parcels\\nof earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind\\nthem,--so perfectly that not a particle could be washed away in the longest\\ntransport: out of one small portion of earth thus _completely_ enclosed by\\nwood in an oak about 50 years old, three dicotyledonous plants germinated:\\nI am certain of the accuracy of this observation. Again, I can show that\\nthe carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea, sometimes escape being\\nimmediately devoured; and seeds of many kinds in the crops of floating\\nbirds long retain their vitality: peas and vetches, for instance, are\\nkilled by even a few days\\' immersion in sea-water; but some taken out of\\nthe crop of a pigeon, which had floated on artificial salt-water for 30\\ndays, to my surprise nearly all germinated.\\n\\nLiving birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the\\ntransportation of seeds. I could give many facts showing how frequently\\nbirds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the ocean.\\nWe may I think safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of\\nflight would often be 35 miles an hour; and some authors have given a far\\nhigher estimate. I have never seen an instance of nutritious seeds passing\\nthrough the intestines of a bird; but hard seeds of fruit pass uninjured\\nthrough even the digestive organs of a turkey. In the course of two months,\\nI picked up in my garden 12 kinds of seeds, out of the excrement of small\\nbirds, and these seemed perfect, and some of them, which I tried,\\ngerminated. {362} But the following fact is more important: the crops of\\nbirds do not secrete gastric juice, and do not in the least injure, as I\\nknow by trial, the germination of seeds; now after a bird has found and\\ndevoured a large supply of food, it is positively asserted that all the\\ngrains do not pass into the gizzard for 12 or even 18 hours. A bird in this\\ninterval might easily be blown to the distance of 500 miles, and hawks are\\nknown to look out for tired birds, and the contents of their torn crops\\nmight thus readily get scattered. Mr. Brent informs me that a friend of his\\nhad to give up flying carrier-pigeons from France to England, as the hawks\\non the English coast destroyed so many on their arrival. Some hawks and\\nowls bolt their prey whole, and after an interval of from twelve to twenty\\nhours, disgorge pellets, which, as I know from experiments made in the\\nZoological Gardens, include seeds capable of germination. Some seeds of the\\noat, wheat, millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated after having\\nbeen from twelve to twenty-one hours in the stomachs of different birds of\\nprey; and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two\\ndays and fourteen hours. Freshwater fish, I find, eat seeds of many land\\nand water plants: fish are frequently devoured by birds, and thus the seeds\\nmight be transported from place to place. I forced many kinds of seeds into\\nthe stomachs of dead fish, and then gave their bodies to fishing-eagles,\\nstorks, and pelicans; these birds after an interval of many hours, either\\nrejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement; and\\nseveral of these seeds retained their power of germination. Certain seeds,\\nhowever, were always killed by this process.\\n\\nAlthough the beaks and feet of birds are generally quite clean, I can show\\nthat earth sometimes adheres to them: in one instance I removed twenty-two\\ngrains {363} of dry argillaceous earth from one foot of a partridge, and in\\nthis earth there was a pebble quite as large as the seed of a vetch. Thus\\nseeds might occasionally be transported to great distances; for many facts\\ncould be given showing that soil almost everywhere is charged with seeds.\\nReflect for a moment on the millions of quails which annually cross the\\nMediterranean; and can we doubt that the earth adhering to their feet would\\nsometimes include a few minute seeds? But I shall presently have to recur\\nto this subject.\\n\\nAs icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones, and\\nhave even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a land-bird, I can\\nhardly doubt that they must occasionally have transported seeds from one\\npart to another of the arctic and antarctic regions, as suggested by Lyell;\\nand during the Glacial period from one part of the now temperate regions to\\nanother. In the Azores, from the large number of the species of plants\\ncommon to Europe, in comparison with the plants of other oceanic islands\\nnearer to the mainland, and (as remarked by Mr. H. C. Watson) from the\\nsomewhat northern character of the flora in comparison with the latitude, I\\nsuspected that these islands had been partly stocked by ice-borne seeds,\\nduring the Glacial epoch. At my request Sir C. Lyell wrote to M. Hartung to\\ninquire whether he had observed erratic boulders on these islands, and he\\nanswered that he had found large fragments of granite and other rocks,\\nwhich do not occur in the archipelago. Hence we may safely infer that\\nicebergs formerly landed their rocky burthens on the shores of these\\nmid-ocean islands, and it is at least possible that they may have brought\\nthither the seeds of northern plants.\\n\\nConsidering that the several above means of transport, and that several\\nother means, which without {364} doubt remain to be discovered, have been\\nin action year after year, for centuries and tens of thousands of years, it\\nwould I think be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become\\nwidely transported. These means of transport are sometimes called\\naccidental, but this is not strictly correct: the currents of the sea are\\nnot accidental, nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind. It should\\nbe observed that scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very\\ngreat distances; for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a\\ngreat length of time to the action of sea-water; nor could they be long\\ncarried in the crops or intestines of birds. These means, however, would\\nsuffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred miles in\\nbreadth, or from island to island, or from a continent to a neighbouring\\nisland, but not from one distant continent to another. The floras of\\ndistant continents would not by such means become mingled in any great\\ndegree; but would remain as distinct as we now see them to be. The\\ncurrents, from their course, would never bring seeds from North America to\\nBritain, though they might and do bring seeds from the West Indies to our\\nwestern shores, where, if not killed by so long an immersion in salt-water,\\nthey could not endure our climate. Almost every year, one or two land-birds\\nare blown across the whole Atlantic Ocean, from North America to the\\nwestern shores of Ireland and England; but seeds could be transported by\\nthese wanderers only by one means, namely, in dirt sticking to their feet,\\nwhich is in itself a rare accident. Even in this case, how small would the\\nchance be of a seed falling on favourable soil, and coming to maturity! But\\nit would be a great error to argue that because a well-stocked island, like\\nGreat Britain, has not, as far as is known {365} (and it would be very\\ndifficult to prove this), received within the last few centuries, through\\noccasional means of transport, immigrants from Europe or any other\\ncontinent, that a poorly-stocked island, though standing more remote from\\nthe mainland, would not receive colonists by similar means. I do not doubt\\nthat out of twenty seeds or animals transported to an island, even if far\\nless well-stocked than Britain, scarcely more than one would be so well\\nfitted to its new home, as to become naturalised. But this, as it seems to\\nme, is no valid argument against what would be effected by occasional means\\nof transport, during the long lapse of geological time, whilst an island\\nwas being upheaved and formed, and before it had become fully stocked with\\ninhabitants. On almost bare land, with few or no destructive insects or\\nbirds living there, nearly every seed, which chanced to arrive, if fitted\\nfor the climate, would be sure to germinate and survive.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Dispersal during the Glacial period._--The identity of many plants and\\nanimals, on mountain-summits, separated from each other by hundreds of\\nmiles of lowlands, where the Alpine species could not possibly exist, is\\none of the most striking cases known of the same species living at distant\\npoints, without the apparent possibility of their having migrated from one\\nto the other. It is indeed a remarkable fact to see so many of the same\\nplants living on the snowy regions of the Alps or Pyrenees, and in the\\nextreme northern parts of Europe; but it is far more remarkable, that the\\nplants on the White Mountains, in the United States of America, are all the\\nsame with those of Labrador, and nearly all the same, as we hear from Asa\\nGray, with those on the loftiest mountains of Europe. Even as long ago as\\n1747, such facts led Gmelin to conclude that the {366} same species must\\nhave been independently created at several distinct points; and we might\\nhave remained in this same belief, had not Agassiz and others called vivid\\nattention to the Glacial period, which, as we shall immediately see,\\naffords a simple explanation of these facts. We have evidence of almost\\nevery conceivable kind, organic and inorganic, that within a very recent\\ngeological period, central Europe and North America suffered under an\\nArctic climate. The ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell their tale\\nmore plainly, than do the mountains of Scotland and Wales, with their\\nscored flanks, polished surfaces, and perched boulders, of the icy streams\\nwith which their valleys were lately filled. So greatly has the climate of\\nEurope changed, that in Northern Italy, gigantic moraines, left by old\\nglaciers, are now clothed by the vine and maize. Throughout a large part of\\nthe United States, erratic boulders, and rocks scored by drifted icebergs\\nand coast-ice, plainly reveal a former cold period.\\n\\nThe former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the\\ninhabitants of Europe, as explained with remarkable clearness by Edward\\nForbes, is substantially as follows. But we shall follow the changes more\\nreadily, by supposing a new glacial period to come slowly on, and then pass\\naway, as formerly occurred. As the cold came on, and as each more southern\\nzone became fitted for arctic beings and ill-fitted for their former more\\ntemperate inhabitants, the latter would be supplanted and arctic\\nproductions would take their places. The inhabitants of the more temperate\\nregions would at the same time travel southward, unless they were stopped\\nby barriers, in which case they would perish. The mountains would become\\ncovered with snow and ice, and their former Alpine inhabitants would\\ndescend to the plains. By the time that the cold had reached {367} its\\nmaximum, we should have a uniform arctic fauna and flora, covering the\\ncentral parts of Europe, as far south as the Alps and Pyrenees, and even\\nstretching into Spain. The now temperate regions of the United States would\\nlikewise be covered by arctic plants and animals, and these would be nearly\\nthe same with those of Europe; for the present circumpolar inhabitants,\\nwhich we suppose to have everywhere travelled southward, are remarkably\\nuniform round the world. We may suppose that the Glacial period came on a\\nlittle earlier or later in North America than in Europe, so will the\\nsouthern migration there have been a little earlier or later; but this will\\nmake no difference in the final result.\\n\\nAs the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward, closely\\nfollowed up in their retreat by the productions of the more temperate\\nregions. And as the snow melted from the bases of the mountains, the arctic\\nforms would seize on the cleared and thawed ground, always ascending higher\\nand higher, as the warmth increased, whilst their brethren were pursuing\\ntheir northern journey. Hence, when the warmth had fully returned, the same\\narctic species, which had lately lived in a body together on the lowlands\\nof the Old and New Worlds, would be left isolated on distant\\nmountain-summits (having been exterminated on all lesser heights) and in\\nthe arctic regions of both hemispheres.\\n\\nThus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so immensely\\nremote as on the mountains of the United States and of Europe. We can thus\\nalso understand the fact that the Alpine plants of each mountain-range are\\nmore especially related to the arctic forms living due north or nearly due\\nnorth of them: for the migration as the cold came on, and the re-migration\\non the returning warmth, will generally {368} have been due south and\\nnorth. The Alpine plants, for example, of Scotland, as remarked by Mr.\\nH. C. Watson, and those of the Pyrenees, as remarked by Ramond, are more\\nespecially allied to the plants of northern Scandinavia; those of the\\nUnited States to Labrador; those of the mountains of Siberia to the arctic\\nregions of that country. These views, grounded as they are on the perfectly\\nwell-ascertained occurrence of a former Glacial period, seem to me to\\nexplain in so satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the Alpine\\nand Arctic productions of Europe and America, that when in other regions we\\nfind the same species on distant mountain-summits, we may almost conclude\\nwithout other evidence, that a colder climate permitted their former\\nmigration across the low intervening tracts, since become too warm for\\ntheir existence.\\n\\nIf the climate, since the Glacial period, has ever been in any degree\\nwarmer than at present (as some geologists in the United States believe to\\nhave been the case, chiefly from the distribution of the fossil Gnathodon),\\nthen the arctic and temperate productions will at a very late period have\\nmarched a little further north, and subsequently have retreated to their\\npresent homes; but I have met with no satisfactory evidence with respect to\\nthis intercalated slightly warmer period, since the Glacial period.\\n\\nThe arctic forms, during their long southern migration and re-migration\\nnorthward, will have been exposed to nearly the same climate, and, as is\\nespecially to be noticed, they will have kept in a body together;\\nconsequently their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed, and,\\nin accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume, they will not\\nhave been liable to much modification. But with our Alpine productions,\\nleft isolated from the moment of the returning warmth, {369} first at the\\nbases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains, the case will have\\nbeen somewhat different; for it is not likely that all the same arctic\\nspecies will have been left on mountain ranges distant from each other, and\\nhave survived there ever since; they will, also, in all probability have\\nbecome mingled with ancient Alpine species, which must have existed on the\\nmountains before the commencement of the Glacial epoch, and which during\\nits coldest period will have been temporarily driven down to the plains;\\nthey will, also, have been exposed to somewhat different climatal\\ninfluences. Their mutual relations will thus have been in some degree\\ndisturbed; consequently they will have been liable to modification; and\\nthis we find has been the case; for if we compare the present Alpine plants\\nand animals of the several great European mountain-ranges, though very many\\nof the species are identically the same, some present varieties, some are\\nranked as doubtful forms, and some few are distinct yet closely allied or\\nrepresentative species.\\n\\nIn illustrating what, as I believe, actually took place during the Glacial\\nperiod, I assumed that at its commencement the arctic productions were as\\nuniform round the polar regions as they are at the present day. But the\\nforegoing remarks on distribution apply not only to strictly arctic forms,\\nbut also to many sub-arctic and to some few northern temperate forms, for\\nsome of these are the same on the lower mountains and on the plains of\\nNorth America and Europe; and it may be reasonably asked how I account for\\nthe necessary degree of uniformity of the sub-arctic and northern temperate\\nforms round the world, at the commencement of the Glacial period. At the\\npresent day, the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the Old\\nand New Worlds are separated from each other by the {370} Atlantic Ocean\\nand by the extreme northern part of the Pacific. During the Glacial period,\\nwhen the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards\\nthan at present, they must have been still more completely separated by\\nwider spaces of ocean. I believe the above difficulty may be surmounted by\\nlooking to still earlier changes of climate of an opposite nature. We have\\ngood reason to believe that during the newer Pliocene period, before the\\nGlacial epoch, and whilst the majority of the inhabitants of the world were\\nspecifically the same as now, the climate was warmer than at the present\\nday. Hence we may suppose that the organisms now living under the climate\\nof latitude 60В°, during the Pliocene period lived further north under the\\nPolar Circle, in latitude 66В°-67В°; and that the strictly arctic productions\\nthen lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole. Now if we look at a\\nglobe, we shall see that under the Polar Circle there is almost continuous\\nland from western Europe, through Siberia, to eastern America. And to this\\ncontinuity of the circumpolar land, and to the consequent freedom for\\nintermigration under a more favourable climate, I attribute the necessary\\namount of uniformity in the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions\\nof the Old and New Worlds, at a period anterior to the Glacial epoch.\\n\\nBelieving, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have long\\nremained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected to large,\\nbut partial oscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to extend the\\nabove view, and to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period,\\nsuch as the older Pliocene period, a large number of the same plants and\\nanimals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land; and that these\\nplants and animals, both in the Old and {371} New Worlds, began slowly to\\nmigrate southwards as the climate became less warm, long before the\\ncommencement of the Glacial period. We now see, as I believe, their\\ndescendants, mostly in a modified condition, in the central parts of Europe\\nand the United States. On this view we can understand the relationship,\\nwith very little identity, between the productions of North America and\\nEurope,--a relationship which is most remarkable, considering the distance\\nof the two areas, and their separation by the Atlantic Ocean. We can\\nfurther understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers, that\\nthe productions of Europe and America during the later tertiary stages were\\nmore closely related to each other than they are at the present time; for\\nduring these warmer periods the northern parts of the Old and New Worlds\\nwill have been almost continuously united by land, serving as a bridge,\\nsince rendered impassable by cold, for the intermigration of their\\ninhabitants.\\n\\nDuring the slowly decreasing warmth of the Pliocene period, as soon as the\\nspecies in common, which inhabited the New and Old Worlds, migrated south\\nof the Polar Circle, they must have been completely cut off from each\\nother. This separation, as far as the more temperate productions are\\nconcerned, took place long ages ago. And as the plants and animals migrated\\nsouthward, they will have become mingled in the one great region with the\\nnative American productions, and have had to compete with them; and in the\\nother great region, with those of the Old World. Consequently we have here\\neverything favourable for much modification,--for far more modification\\nthan with the Alpine productions, left isolated, within a much more recent\\nperiod, on the several mountain-ranges and on the arctic lands of the two\\nWorlds. Hence it has come, that when we compare {372} the now living\\nproductions of the temperate regions of the New and Old Worlds, we find\\nvery few identical species (though Asa Gray has lately shown that more\\nplants are identical than was formerly supposed), but we find in every\\ngreat class many forms, which some naturalists rank as geographical races,\\nand others as distinct species; and a host of closely allied or\\nrepresentative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as specifically\\ndistinct.\\n\\nAs on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern migration of a\\nmarine fauna, which during the Pliocene or even a somewhat earlier period,\\nwas nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the Polar Circle, will\\naccount, on the theory of modification, for many closely allied forms now\\nliving in areas completely sundered. Thus, I think, we can understand the\\npresence of many existing and tertiary representative forms on the eastern\\nand western shores of temperate North America; and the still more striking\\ncase of many closely allied crustaceans (as described in Dana\\'s admirable\\nwork), of some fish and other marine animals, in the Mediterranean and in\\nthe seas of Japan,--areas now separated by a continent and by nearly a\\nhemisphere of equatorial ocean.\\n\\nThese cases of relationship, without identity, of the inhabitants of seas\\nnow disjoined, and likewise of the past and present inhabitants of the\\ntemperate lands of North America and Europe, are inexplicable on the theory\\nof creation. We cannot say that they have been created alike, in\\ncorrespondence with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas;\\nfor if we compare, for instance, certain parts of South America with the\\nsouthern continents of the Old World, we see countries closely\\ncorresponding in all their physical conditions, but with their inhabitants\\nutterly dissimilar. {373}\\n\\nBut we must return to our more immediate subject, the Glacial period. I am\\nconvinced that Forbes\\'s view may be largely extended. In Europe we have the\\nplainest evidence of the cold period, from the western shores of Britain to\\nthe Oural range, and southward to the Pyrenees. We may infer from the\\nfrozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation, that Siberia was\\nsimilarly affected. Along the Himalaya, at points 900 miles apart, glaciers\\nhave left the marks of their former low descent; and in Sikkim, Dr. Hooker\\nsaw maize growing on gigantic ancient moraines. South of the equator, we\\nhave some direct evidence of former glacial action in New Zealand; and the\\nsame plants, found on widely separated mountains in that island, tell the\\nsame story. If one account which has been published can be trusted, we have\\ndirect evidence of glacial action in the south-eastern corner of Australia.\\n\\nLooking to America; in the northern half, ice-borne fragments of rock have\\nbeen observed on the eastern side as far south as lat. 36В°-37В°, and on the\\nshores of the Pacific, where the climate is now so different, as far south\\nas lat. 46В°; erratic boulders have, also, been noticed on the Rocky\\nMountains. In the Cordillera of Equatorial South America, glaciers once\\nextended far below their present level. In central Chili I was astonished\\nat the structure of a vast mound of detritus, about 800 feet in height,\\ncrossing a valley of the Andes; and this I now feel convinced was a\\ngigantic moraine, left far below any existing glacier. Further south on\\nboth sides of the continent, from lat. 41В° to the southernmost extremity,\\nwe have the clearest evidence of former glacial action, in huge boulders\\ntransported far from their parent source.\\n\\nWe do not know that the Glacial epoch was strictly simultaneous at these\\nseveral far distant points on {374} opposite sides of the world. But we\\nhave good evidence in almost every case, that the epoch was included within\\nthe latest geological period. We have, also, excellent evidence, that it\\nendured for an enormous time, as measured by years, at each point. The cold\\nmay have come on, or have ceased, earlier at one point of the globe than at\\nanother, but seeing that it endured for long at each, and that it was\\ncontemporaneous in a geological sense, it seems to me probable that it was,\\nduring a part at least of the period, actually simultaneous throughout the\\nworld. Without some distinct evidence to the contrary, we may at least\\nadmit as probable that the glacial action was simultaneous on the eastern\\nand western sides of North America, in the Cordillera under the equator and\\nunder the warmer temperate zones, and on both sides of the southern\\nextremity of the continent. If this be admitted, it is difficult to avoid\\nbelieving that the temperature of the whole world was at this period\\nsimultaneously cooler. But it would suffice for my purpose, if the\\ntemperature was at the same time lower along certain broad belts of\\nlongitude.\\n\\nOn this view of the whole world, or at least of broad longitudinal belts,\\nhaving been simultaneously colder from pole to pole, much light can be\\nthrown on the present distribution of identical and allied species. In\\nAmerica, Dr. Hooker has shown that between forty and fifty of the flowering\\nplants of Tierra del Fuego, forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty\\nflora, are common to Europe, enormously remote as these two points are; and\\nthere are many closely allied species. On the lofty mountains of equatorial\\nAmerica a host of peculiar species belonging to European genera occur. On\\nthe highest mountains of Brazil, some few European genera were found by\\nGardner, which do not exist in the wide {375} intervening hot countries. So\\non the Silla of Caraccas the illustrious Humboldt long ago found species\\nbelonging to genera characteristic of the Cordillera. On the mountains of\\nAbyssinia, several European forms and some few representatives of the\\npeculiar flora of the Cape of Good Hope occur. At the Cape of Good Hope a\\nvery few European species, believed not to have been introduced by man, and\\non the mountains, some few representative European forms are found, which\\nhave not been discovered in the intertropical parts of Africa. On the\\nHimalaya, and on the isolated mountain-ranges of the peninsula of India, on\\nthe heights of Ceylon, and on the volcanic cones of Java, many plants\\noccur, either identically the same or representing each other, and at the\\nsame time representing plants of Europe, not found in the intervening hot\\nlowlands. A list of the genera collected on the loftier peaks of Java\\nraises a picture of a collection made on a hill in Europe! Still more\\nstriking is the fact that southern Australian forms are clearly represented\\nby plants growing on the summits of the mountains of Borneo. Some of these\\nAustralian forms, as I hear from Dr. Hooker, extend along the heights of\\nthe peninsula of Malacca, and are thinly scattered, on the one hand over\\nIndia and on the other as far north as Japan.\\n\\nOn the southern mountains of Australia, Dr. F. MГјller has discovered\\nseveral European species; other species, not introduced by man, occur on\\nthe lowlands; and a long list can be given, as I am informed by Dr. Hooker,\\nof European genera, found in Australia, but not in the intermediate torrid\\nregions. In the admirable \\'Introduction to the Flora of New Zealand,\\' by\\nDr. Hooker, analogous and striking facts are given in regard to the plants\\nof that large island. Hence we see that throughout the world, the plants\\ngrowing on the {376} more lofty mountains, and on the temperate lowlands of\\nthe northern and southern hemispheres, are sometimes identically the same;\\nbut they are much oftener specifically distinct, though related to each\\nother in a most remarkable manner.\\n\\nThis brief abstract applies to plants alone: some strictly analogous facts\\ncould be given on the distribution of terrestrial animals. In marine\\nproductions, similar cases occur; as an example, I may quote a remark by\\nthe highest authority, Prof. Dana, that \"it is certainly a wonderful fact\\nthat New Zealand should have a closer resemblance in its Crustacea to Great\\nBritain, its antipode, than to any other part of the world.\" Sir J.\\nRichardson, also, speaks of the reappearance on the shores of New Zealand,\\nTasmania, &c., of northern forms of fish. Dr. Hooker informs me that\\ntwenty-five species of AlgГ¦ are common to New Zealand and to Europe, but\\nhave not been found in the intermediate tropical seas.\\n\\nIt should be observed that the northern species and forms found in the\\nsouthern parts of the southern hemisphere, and on the mountain-ranges of\\nthe intertropical regions, are not arctic, but belong to the northern\\ntemperate zones. As Mr. H. C. Watson has recently remarked, \"In receding\\nfrom polar towards equatorial latitudes, the Alpine or mountain floras\\nreally become less and less arctic.\" Many of the forms living on the\\nmountains of the warmer regions of the earth and in the southern hemisphere\\nare of doubtful value, being ranked by some naturalists as specifically\\ndistinct, by others as varieties; but some are certainly identical, and\\nmany, though closely related to northern forms, must be ranked as distinct\\nspecies.\\n\\nNow let us see what light can be thrown on the foregoing facts, on the\\nbelief, supported as it is by a large {377} body of geological evidence,\\nthat the whole world, or a large part of it, was during the Glacial period\\nsimultaneously much colder than at present. The Glacial period, as measured\\nby years, must have been very long; and when we remember over what vast\\nspaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread within a few\\ncenturies, this period will have been ample for any amount of migration. As\\nthe cold came slowly on, all the tropical plants and other productions will\\nhave retreated from both sides towards the equator, followed in the rear by\\nthe temperate productions, and these by the arctic; but with the latter we\\nare not now concerned. The tropical plants probably suffered much\\nextinction; how much no one can say; perhaps formerly the tropics supported\\nas many species as we see at the present day crowded together at the Cape\\nof Good Hope, and in parts of temperate Australia. As we know that many\\ntropical plants and animals can withstand a considerable amount of cold,\\nmany might have escaped extermination during a moderate fall of\\ntemperature, more especially by escaping into the lowest, most protected,\\nand warmest districts. But the great fact to bear in mind is, that all\\ntropical productions will have suffered to a certain extent. On the other\\nhand, the temperate productions, after migrating nearer to the equator,\\nthough they will have been placed under somewhat new conditions, will have\\nsuffered less. And it is certain that many temperate plants, if protected\\nfrom the inroads of competitors, can withstand a much warmer climate than\\ntheir own. Hence, it seems to me possible, bearing in mind that the\\ntropical productions were in a suffering state and could not have presented\\na firm front against intruders, that a certain number of the more vigorous\\nand dominant temperate forms might have penetrated the native ranks and\\nhave reached or {378} even crossed the equator. The invasion would, of\\ncourse, have been greatly favoured by high land, and perhaps by a dry\\nclimate; for Dr. Falconer informs me that it is the damp with the heat of\\nthe tropics which is so destructive to perennial plants from a temperate\\nclimate. On the other hand, the most humid and hottest districts will have\\nafforded an asylum to the tropical natives. The mountain-ranges north-west\\nof the Himalaya, and the long line of the Cordillera, seem to have afforded\\ntwo great lines of invasion: and it is a striking fact, lately communicated\\nto me by Dr. Hooker, that all the flowering plants, about forty-six in\\nnumber, common to Tierra del Fuego and to Europe still exist in North\\nAmerica, which must have lain on the line of march. But I do not doubt that\\nsome temperate productions entered and crossed even the _lowlands_ of the\\ntropics at the period when the cold was most intense,--when arctic forms\\nhad migrated some twenty-five degrees of latitude from their native country\\nand covered the land at the foot of the Pyrenees. At this period of extreme\\ncold, I believe that the climate under the equator at the level of the sea\\nwas about the same with that now felt there at the height of six or seven\\nthousand feet. During this the coldest period, I suppose that large spaces\\nof the tropical lowlands were clothed with a mingled tropical and temperate\\nvegetation, like that now growing with strange luxuriance at the base of\\nthe Himalaya, as graphically described by Hooker.\\n\\nThus, as I believe, a considerable number of plants, a few terrestrial\\nanimals, and some marine productions, migrated during the Glacial period\\nfrom the northern and southern temperate zones into the intertropical\\nregions, and some even crossed the equator. As the warmth returned, these\\ntemperate forms would naturally ascend the higher mountains, being\\nexterminated on the {379} lowlands; those which had not reached the equator\\nwould re-migrate northward or southward towards their former homes; but the\\nforms, chiefly northern, which had crossed the equator, would travel still\\nfurther from their homes into the more temperate latitudes of the opposite\\nhemisphere. Although we have reason to believe from geological evidence\\nthat the whole body of arctic shells underwent scarcely any modification\\nduring their long southern migration and re-migration northward, the case\\nmay have been wholly different with those intruding forms which settled\\nthemselves on the intertropical mountains, and in the southern hemisphere.\\nThese being surrounded by strangers will have had to compete with many new\\nforms of life; and it is probable that selected modifications in their\\nstructure, habits, and constitutions will have profited them. Thus many of\\nthese wanderers, though still plainly related by inheritance to their\\nbrethren of the northern or southern hemispheres, now exist in their new\\nhomes as well-marked varieties or as distinct species.\\n\\nIt is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by Hooker in regard to\\nAmerica, and by Alph. de Candolle in regard to Australia, that many more\\nidentical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from the north\\nto the south, than in a reversed direction. We see, however, a few southern\\nvegetable forms on the mountains of Borneo and Abyssinia. I suspect that\\nthis preponderant migration from north to south is due to the greater\\nextent of land in the north, and to the northern forms having existed in\\ntheir own homes in greater numbers, and having consequently been advanced\\nthrough natural selection and competition to a higher stage of perfection\\nor dominating power, than the southern forms. And thus, when they became\\ncommingled during the Glacial period, the northern forms {380} were enabled\\nto beat the less powerful southern forms. Just in the same manner as we see\\nat the present day, that very many European productions cover the ground in\\nLa Plata, and in a lesser degree in Australia, and have to a certain extent\\nbeaten the natives; whereas extremely few southern forms have become\\nnaturalised in any part of Europe, though hides, wool, and other objects\\nlikely to carry seeds have been largely imported into Europe during the\\nlast two or three centuries from La Plata, and during the last thirty or\\nforty years from Australia. Something of the same kind must have occurred\\non the intertropical mountains: no doubt before the Glacial period they\\nwere stocked with endemic Alpine forms; but these have almost everywhere\\nlargely yielded to the more dominant forms, generated in the larger areas\\nand more efficient workshops of the north. In many islands the native\\nproductions are nearly equalled or even outnumbered by the naturalised; and\\nif the natives have not been actually exterminated, their numbers have been\\ngreatly reduced, and this is the first stage towards extinction. A mountain\\nis an island on the land; and the intertropical mountains before the\\nGlacial period must have been completely isolated; and I believe that the\\nproductions of these islands on the land yielded to those produced within\\nthe larger areas of the north, just in the same way as the productions of\\nreal islands have everywhere lately yielded to continental forms,\\nnaturalised by man\\'s agency.\\n\\nI am far from supposing that all difficulties are removed on the view here\\ngiven in regard to the range and affinities of the allied species which\\nlive in the northern and southern temperate zones and on the mountains of\\nthe intertropical regions. Very many difficulties remain to be solved. I do\\nnot pretend to {381} indicate the exact lines and means of migration, or\\nthe reason why certain species and not others have migrated; why certain\\nspecies have been modified and have given rise to new groups of forms, and\\nothers have remained unaltered. We cannot hope to explain such facts, until\\nwe can say why one species and not another becomes naturalised by man\\'s\\nagency in a foreign land; why one ranges twice or thrice as far, and is\\ntwice or thrice as common, as another species within their own homes.\\n\\nI have said that many difficulties remain to be solved: some of the most\\nremarkable are stated with admirable clearness by Dr. Hooker in his\\nbotanical works on the antarctic regions. These cannot be here discussed. I\\nwill only say that as far as regards the occurrence of identical species at\\npoints so enormously remote as Kerguelen Land, New Zealand, and Fuegia, I\\nbelieve that towards the close of the Glacial period, icebergs, as\\nsuggested by Lyell, have been largely concerned in their dispersal. But the\\nexistence of several quite distinct species, belonging to genera\\nexclusively confined to the south, at these and other distant points of the\\nsouthern hemisphere, is, on my theory of descent with modification, a far\\nmore remarkable case of difficulty. For some of these species are so\\ndistinct, that we cannot suppose that there has been time since the\\ncommencement of the Glacial period for their migration, and for their\\nsubsequent modification to the necessary degree. The facts seem to me to\\nindicate that peculiar and very distinct species have migrated in radiating\\nlines from some common centre; and I am inclined to look in the southern,\\nas in the northern hemisphere, to a former and warmer period, before the\\ncommencement of the Glacial period, when the antarctic lands, now covered\\nwith ice, supported a highly peculiar {382} and isolated flora. I suspect\\nthat before this flora was exterminated by the Glacial epoch, a few forms\\nwere widely dispersed to various points of the southern hemisphere by\\noccasional means of transport, and by the aid, as halting-places, of\\nexisting and now sunken islands: By these means, as I believe, the southern\\nshores of America, Australia, New Zealand, have become slightly tinted by\\nthe same peculiar forms of vegetable life.\\n\\nSir C. Lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language almost\\nidentical with mine, on the effects of great alternations of climate on\\ngeographical distribution. I believe that the world has recently felt one\\nof his great cycles of change; and that on this view, combined with\\nmodification through natural selection, a multitude of facts in the present\\ndistribution both of the same and of allied forms of life can be explained.\\nThe living waters may be said to have flowed during one short period from\\nthe north and from the south, and to have crossed at the equator; but to\\nhave flowed with greater force from the north so as to have freely\\ninundated the south. As the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines,\\nthough rising higher on the shores where the tide rises highest, so have\\nthe living waters left their living drift on our mountain-summits, in a\\nline gently rising from the arctic lowlands to a great height under the\\nequator. The various beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage\\nraces of man, driven up and surviving in the mountain-fastnesses of almost\\nevery land, which serve as a record, full of interest to us, of the former\\ninhabitants of the surrounding lowlands.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{383}\\n\\nCHAPTER XII.\\n\\nGEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION--_continued_.\\n\\n    Distribution of fresh-water productions--On the inhabitants of oceanic\\n    islands--Absence of Batrachians and of terrestrial Mammals--On the\\n    relation of the inhabitants of islands to those of the nearest\\n    mainland--On colonisation from the nearest source with subsequent\\n    modification--Summary of the last and present chapters.\\n\\nAs lakes and river-systems are separated from each other by barriers of\\nland, it might have been thought that fresh-water productions would not\\nhave ranged widely within the same country, and as the sea is apparently a\\nstill more impassable barrier, that they never would have extended to\\ndistant countries. But the case is exactly the reverse. Not only have many\\nfresh-water species, belonging to quite different classes, an enormous\\nrange, but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner throughout the\\nworld. I well remember, when first collecting in the fresh waters of\\nBrazil, feeling much surprise at the similarity of the fresh-water insects,\\nshells, &c., and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding terrestrial\\nbeings, compared with those of Britain.\\n\\nBut this power in fresh-water productions of ranging widely, though so\\nunexpected, can, I think, in most cases be explained by their having become\\nfitted, in a manner highly useful to them, for short and frequent\\nmigrations from pond to pond, or from stream to stream; and liability to\\nwide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary\\nconsequence. We can here consider only a few cases. In regard to {384}\\nfish, I believe that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of\\ndistant continents. But on the same continent the species often range\\nwidely and almost capriciously; for two river-systems will have some fish\\nin common and some different. A few facts seem to favour the possibility of\\ntheir occasional transport by accidental means; like that of the live fish\\nnot rarely dropped by whirlwinds in India, and the vitality of their ova\\nwhen removed from the water. But I am inclined to attribute the dispersal\\nof fresh-water fish mainly to slight changes within the recent period in\\nthe level of the land, having caused rivers to flow into each other.\\nInstances, also, could be given of this having occurred during floods,\\nwithout any change of level. We have evidence in the loess of the Rhine of\\nconsiderable changes of level in the land within a very recent geological\\nperiod, and when the surface was peopled by existing land and fresh-water\\nshells. The wide difference of the fish on opposite sides of continuous\\nmountain-ranges, which from an early period must have parted river-systems\\nand completely prevented their inosculation, seems to lead to this same\\nconclusion. With respect to allied fresh-water fish occurring at very\\ndistant points of the world, no doubt there are many cases which cannot at\\npresent be explained: but some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient\\nforms, and in such cases there will have been ample time for great\\ngeographical changes, and consequently time and means for much migration.\\nIn the second place, salt-water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to\\nlive in fresh water; and, according to Valenciennes, there is hardly a\\nsingle group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh water, so that we may\\nimagine that a marine member of a fresh-water group might travel far along\\nthe shores of the sea, and {385} subsequently become modified and adapted\\nto the fresh waters of a distant land.\\n\\nSome species of fresh-water shells have a very wide range, and allied\\nspecies, which, on my theory, are descended from a common parent and must\\nhave proceeded from a single source, prevail throughout the world. Their\\ndistribution at first perplexed me much, as their ova are not likely to be\\ntransported by birds, and they are immediately killed by sea-water, as are\\nthe adults. I could not even understand how some naturalised species have\\nrapidly spread throughout the same country. But two facts, which I have\\nobserved--and no doubt many others remain to be observed--throw some light\\non this subject. When a duck suddenly emerges from a pond covered with\\nduck-weed, I have twice seen these little plants adhering to its back; and\\nit has happened to me, in removing a little duckweed from one aquarium to\\nanother, that I have quite unintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water\\nshells from the other. But another agency is perhaps more effectual: I\\nsuspended a duck\\'s feet, which might represent those of a bird sleeping in\\na natural pond, in an aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were\\nhatching; and I found that numbers of the extremely minute and just-hatched\\nshells crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out\\nof the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more\\nadvanced age they would voluntarily drop off. These just hatched molluscs,\\nthough aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck\\'s feet, in damp air,\\nfrom twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time a duck or heron\\nmight fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and would be sure to alight\\non a pool or rivulet, if blown across sea to an oceanic island or to any\\nother distant point. Sir Charles Lyell also {386} informs me that a Dyticus\\nhas been caught with an Ancylus (a fresh-water shell like a limpet) firmly\\nadhering to it; and a water-beetle of the same family, a Colymbetes, once\\nflew on board the \\'Beagle,\\' when forty-five miles distant from the nearest\\nland: how much farther it might have flown with a favouring gale no one can\\ntell.\\n\\nWith respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges many\\nfresh-water and even marsh-species have, both over continents and to the\\nmost remote oceanic islands. This is strikingly shown, as remarked by Alph.\\nde Candolle, in large groups of terrestrial plants, which have only a very\\nfew aquatic members; for these latter seem immediately to acquire, as if in\\nconsequence, a very wide range. I think favourable means of dispersal\\nexplain this fact. I have before mentioned that earth occasionally, though\\nrarely, adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks of birds. Wading\\nbirds, which frequent the muddy edges of ponds, if suddenly flushed, would\\nbe the most likely to have muddy feet. Birds of this order I can show are\\nthe greatest wanderers, and are occasionally found on the most remote and\\nbarren islands in the open ocean; they would not be likely to alight on the\\nsurface of the sea, so that the dirt would not be washed off their feet;\\nwhen making land, they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-water\\nhaunts. I do not believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of\\nponds is with seeds: I have tried several little experiments, but will here\\ngive only the most striking case: I took in February three table-spoonfuls\\nof mud from three different points, beneath water, on the edge of a little\\npond; this mud when dry weighed only 6Вѕ ounces; I kept it covered up in my\\nstudy for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it grew; the\\nplants were {387} of many kinds, and were altogether 537 in number; and yet\\nthe viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup! Considering these\\nfacts, I think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if water-birds did\\nnot transport the seeds of fresh-water plants to vast distances, and if\\nconsequently the range of these plants was not very great. The same agency\\nmay have come into play with the eggs of some of the smaller fresh-water\\nanimals.\\n\\nOther and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. I have stated\\nthat fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they reject many\\nother kinds after having swallowed them; even small fish swallow seeds of\\nmoderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and Potamogeton. Herons and\\nother birds, century after century, have gone on daily devouring fish; they\\nthen take flight and go to other waters, or are blown across the sea; and\\nwe have seen that seeds retain their power of germination, when rejected in\\npellets or in excrement, many hours afterwards. When I saw the great size\\nof the seeds of that fine water-lily, the Nelumbium, and remembered Alph.\\nde Candolle\\'s remarks on this plant, I thought that its distribution must\\nremain quite inexplicable; but Audubon states that he found the seeds of\\nthe great southern water-lily (probably, according to Dr. Hooker, the\\nNelumbium luteum) in a heron\\'s stomach; although I do not know the fact,\\nyet analogy makes me believe that a heron flying to another pond and\\ngetting a hearty meal of fish, would probably reject from its stomach a\\npellet containing the seeds of the Nelumbium undigested; or the seeds might\\nbe dropped by the bird whilst feeding its young, in the same way as fish\\nare known sometimes to be dropped.\\n\\nIn considering these several means of distribution, {388} it should be\\nremembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance, on a\\nrising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg will have a\\ngood chance of succeeding. Although there will always be a struggle for\\nlife between the individuals of the species, however few, already occupying\\nany pond, yet as the number of kinds is small, compared with those on the\\nland, the competition will probably be less severe between aquatic than\\nbetween terrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the waters of a\\nforeign country, would have a better chance of seizing on a place, than in\\nthe case of terrestrial colonists. We should, also, remember that some,\\nperhaps many, freshwater productions are low in the scale of nature, and\\nthat we have reason to believe that such low beings change or become\\nmodified less quickly than the high; and this will give longer time than\\nthe average for the migration of the same aquatic species. We should not\\nforget the probability of many species having formerly ranged as\\ncontinuously as fresh-water productions ever can range, over immense areas,\\nand having subsequently become extinct in intermediate regions. But the\\nwide distribution of fresh-water plants and of the lower animals, whether\\nretaining the same identical form or in some degree modified, I believe\\nmainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals,\\nmore especially by fresh-water birds, which have large powers of flight,\\nand naturally travel from one to another and often distant piece of water.\\nNature, like a careful gardener, thus takes her seeds from a bed of a\\nparticular nature, and drops them in another equally well fitted for them.\\n\\n\\n\\n_On the Inhabitants of Oceanic Islands._--We now come to the last of the\\nthree classes of facts, which I {389} have selected as presenting the\\ngreatest amount of difficulty, on the view that all the individuals both of\\nthe same and of allied species have descended from a single parent; and\\ntherefore have all proceeded from a common birthplace, notwithstanding that\\nin the course of time they have come to inhabit distant points of the\\nglobe. I have already stated that I cannot honestly admit Forbes\\'s view on\\ncontinental extensions, which, if legitimately followed out, would lead to\\nthe belief that within the recent period all existing islands have been\\nnearly or quite joined to some continent. This view would remove many\\ndifficulties, but it would not, I think, explain all the facts in regard to\\ninsular productions. In the following remarks I shall not confine myself to\\nthe mere question of dispersal; but shall consider some other facts, which\\nbear on the truth of the two theories of independent creation and of\\ndescent with modification.\\n\\nThe species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number\\ncompared with those on equal continental areas: Alph. de Candolle admits\\nthis for plants, and Wollaston for insects. If we look to the large size\\nand varied stations of New Zealand, extending over 780 miles of latitude,\\nand compare its flowering plants, only 750 in number, with those on an\\nequal area at the Cape of Good Hope or in Australia, we must, I think,\\nadmit that something quite independently of any difference in physical\\nconditions has caused so great a difference in number. Even the uniform\\ncounty of Cambridge has 847 plants, and the little island of Anglesea 764,\\nbut a few ferns and a few introduced plants are included in these numbers,\\nand the comparison in some other respects is not quite fair. We have\\nevidence that the barren island of Ascension aboriginally possessed under\\nhalf-a-dozen flowering plants; {390} yet many have become naturalised on\\nit, as they have on New Zealand and on every other oceanic island which can\\nbe named. In St. Helena there is reason to believe that the naturalised\\nplants and animals have nearly or quite exterminated many native\\nproductions. He who admits the doctrine of the creation of each separate\\nspecies, will have to admit, that a sufficient number of the best adapted\\nplants and animals have not been created on oceanic islands; for man has\\nunintentionally stocked them from various sources far more fully and\\nperfectly than has nature.\\n\\nAlthough in oceanic islands the number of kinds of inhabitants is scanty,\\nthe proportion of endemic species (_i.e._ those found nowhere else in the\\nworld) is often extremely large. If we compare, for instance, the number of\\nthe endemic land-shells in Madeira, or of the endemic birds in the\\nGalapagos Archipelago, with the number found on any continent, and then\\ncompare the area of the islands with that of the continent, we shall see\\nthat this is true. This fact might have been expected on my theory, for, as\\nalready explained, species occasionally arriving after long intervals in a\\nnew and isolated district, and having to compete with new associates, will\\nbe eminently liable to modification, and will often produce groups of\\nmodified descendants. But it by no means follows, that, because in an\\nisland nearly all the species of one class are peculiar, those of another\\nclass, or of another section of the same class, are peculiar; and this\\ndifference seems to depend partly on the species which do not become\\nmodified having immigrated with facility and in a body, so that their\\nmutual relations have not been much disturbed; and partly on the frequent\\narrival of unmodified immigrants from the mother-country, and the\\nconsequent intercrossing with them. With respect to the effects of this\\nintercrossing, {391} it should be remembered that the offspring of such\\ncrosses would almost certainly gain in vigour; so that even an occasional\\ncross would produce more effect than might at first have been anticipated.\\nTo give a few examples: in the Galapagos Islands nearly every land-bird,\\nbut only two out of the eleven marine birds, are peculiar; and it is\\nobvious that marine birds could arrive at these islands more easily than\\nland-birds. Bermuda, on the other hand, which lies at about the same\\ndistance from North America as the Galapagos Islands do from South America,\\nand which has a very peculiar soil, does not possess one endemic land-bird;\\nand we know from Mr. J. M. Jones\\'s admirable account of Bermuda, that very\\nmany North American birds, during their great annual migrations, visit\\neither periodically or occasionally this island. Madeira does not possess\\none peculiar bird, and many European and African birds are almost every\\nyear blown there, as I am informed by Mr. E. V. Harcourt. So that these two\\nislands of Bermuda and Madeira have been stocked by birds, which for long\\nages have struggled together in their former homes, and have become\\nmutually adapted to each other; and when settled in their new homes, each\\nkind will have been kept by the others to their proper places and habits,\\nand will consequently have been little liable to modification. Any tendency\\nto modification will, also, have been checked by intercrossing with the\\nunmodified immigrants from the mother-country. Madeira, again, is inhabited\\nby a wonderful number of peculiar land-shells, whereas not one species of\\nsea-shell is confined to its shores: now, though we do not know how\\nsea-shells are dispersed, yet we can see that their eggs or larvae, perhaps\\nattached to seaweed or floating timber, or to the feet of wading-birds,\\nmight be transported far more easily than {392} land-shells, across three\\nor four hundred miles of open sea. The different orders of insects in\\nMadeira apparently present analogous facts.\\n\\nOceanic islands are sometimes deficient in certain classes, and their\\nplaces are apparently occupied by the other inhabitants; in the Galapagos\\nIslands reptiles, and in New Zealand gigantic wingless birds, take the\\nplace of mammals. In the plants of the Galapagos Islands, Dr. Hooker has\\nshown that the proportional numbers of the different orders are very\\ndifferent from what they are elsewhere. Such cases are generally accounted\\nfor by the physical conditions of the islands; but this explanation seems\\nto me not a little doubtful. Facility of immigration, I believe, has been\\nat least as important as the nature of the conditions.\\n\\nMany remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants\\nof remote islands. For instance, in certain islands not tenanted by\\nmammals, some of the endemic plants have beautifully hooked seeds; yet few\\nrelations are more striking than the adaptation of hooked seeds for\\ntransportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds. This case presents no\\ndifficulty on my view, for a hooked seed might be transported to an island\\nby some other means; and the plant then becoming slightly modified, but\\nstill retaining its hooked seeds, would form an endemic species, having as\\nuseless an appendage as any rudimentary organ,--for instance, as the\\nshrivelled wings under the soldered elytra of many insular beetles. Again,\\nislands often possess trees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere\\ninclude only herbaceous species; now trees, as Alph. de Candolle has shown,\\ngenerally have, whatever the cause may be, confined ranges. Hence trees\\nwould be little likely to reach distant oceanic islands; and an herbaceous\\nplant, though it would have no chance of {393} successfully competing in\\nstature with a fully developed tree, when established on an island and\\nhaving to compete with herbaceous plants alone, might readily gain an\\nadvantage by growing taller and taller and overtopping the other plants. If\\nso, natural selection would often tend to add to the stature of herbaceous\\nplants when growing on an oceanic island, to whatever order they belonged,\\nand thus convert them first into bushes and ultimately into trees.\\n\\nWith respect to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands, Bory St.\\nVincent long ago remarked that Batrachians (frogs, toads, newts) have never\\nbeen found on any of the many islands with which the great oceans are\\nstudded. I have taken pains to verify this assertion, and I have found it\\nstrictly true. I have, however, been assured that a frog exists on the\\nmountains of the great island of New Zealand; but I suspect that this\\nexception (if the information be correct) may be explained through glacial\\nagency. This general absence of frogs, toads, and newts on so many oceanic\\nislands cannot be accounted for by their physical conditions; indeed it\\nseems that islands are peculiarly well fitted for these animals; for frogs\\nhave been introduced into Madeira, the Azores, and Mauritius, and have\\nmultiplied so as to become a nuisance. But as these animals and their spawn\\nare known to be immediately killed by sea-water, on my view we can see that\\nthere would be great difficulty in their transportal across the sea, and\\ntherefore why they do not exist on any oceanic island. But why, on the\\ntheory of creation, they should not have been created there, it would be\\nvery difficult to explain.\\n\\nMammals offer another and similar case. I have carefully searched the\\noldest voyages, but have not finished my search; as yet I have not found a\\nsingle {394} instance, free from doubt, of a terrestrial mammal (excluding\\ndomesticated animals kept by the natives) inhabiting an island situated\\nabove 300 miles from a continent or great continental island; and many\\nislands situated at a much less distance are equally barren. The Falkland\\nIslands, which are inhabited by a wolf-like fox, come nearest to an\\nexception; but this group cannot be considered as oceanic, as it lies on a\\nbank connected with the mainland; moreover, icebergs formerly brought\\nboulders to its western shores, and they may have formerly transported\\nfoxes, as so frequently now happens in the arctic regions. Yet it cannot be\\nsaid that small islands will not support small mammals, for they occur in\\nmany parts of the world on very small islands, if close to a continent; and\\nhardly an island can be named on which our smaller quadrupeds have not\\nbecome naturalised and greatly multiplied. It cannot be said, on the\\nordinary view of creation, that there has not been time for the creation of\\nmammals; many volcanic islands are sufficiently ancient, as shown by the\\nstupendous degradation which they have suffered and by their tertiary\\nstrata: there has also been time for the production of endemic species\\nbelonging to other classes; and on continents it is thought that mammals\\nappear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals. Though\\nterrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands, aГ«rial mammals do\\noccur on almost every island. New Zealand possesses two bats found nowhere\\nelse in the world: Norfolk Island, the Viti Archipelago, the Bonin Islands,\\nthe Caroline and Marianne Archipelagoes, and Mauritius, all possess their\\npeculiar bats. Why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force\\nproduced bats and no other mammals on remote islands? On my view this\\nquestion can easily be answered; for no {395} terrestrial mammal can be\\ntransported across a wide space of sea, but bats can fly across. Bats have\\nbeen seen wandering by day far over the Atlantic Ocean; and two North\\nAmerican species either regularly or occasionally visit Bermuda, at the\\ndistance of 600 miles from the mainland. I hear from Mr. Tomes, who has\\nspecially studied this family, that many of the same species have enormous\\nranges, and are found on continents and on far distant islands. Hence we\\nhave only to suppose that such wandering species have been modified through\\nnatural selection in their new homes in relation to their new position, and\\nwe can understand the presence of endemic bats on islands, with the absence\\nof all terrestrial mammals.\\n\\nBesides the absence of terrestrial mammals in relation to the remoteness of\\nislands from continents, there is also a relation, to a certain extent\\nindependent of distance, between the depth of the sea separating an island\\nfrom the neighbouring mainland, and the presence in both of the same\\nmammiferous species or of allied species in a more or less modified\\ncondition. Mr. Windsor Earl has made some striking observations on this\\nhead in regard to the great Malay Archipelago, which is traversed near\\nCelebes by a space of deep ocean; and this space separates two widely\\ndistinct mammalian faunas. On either side the islands are situated on\\nmoderately deep submarine banks, and they are inhabited by closely allied\\nor identical quadrupeds. No doubt some few anomalies occur in this great\\narchipelago, and there is much difficulty in forming a judgment in some\\ncases owing to the probable naturalisation of certain mammals through man\\'s\\nagency; but we shall soon have much light thrown on the natural history of\\nthis archipelago by the admirable zeal and researches of Mr. Wallace. I\\nhave not as yet had time to {396} follow up this subject in all other\\nquarters of the world; but as far as I have gone, the relation generally\\nholds good. We see Britain separated by a shallow channel from Europe, and\\nthe mammals are the same on both sides; we meet with analogous facts on\\nmany islands separated by similar channels from Australia. The West Indian\\nIslands stand on a deeply submerged bank, nearly 1000 fathoms in depth, and\\nhere we find American forms, but the species and even the genera are\\ndistinct. As the amount of modification in all cases depends to a certain\\ndegree on the lapse of time, and as during changes of level it is obvious\\nthat islands separated by shallow channels are more likely to have been\\ncontinuously united within a recent period to the mainland than islands\\nseparated by deeper channels, we can understand the frequent relation\\nbetween the depth of the sea and the degree of affinity of the mammalian\\ninhabitants of islands with those of a neighbouring continent,--an\\ninexplicable relation on the view of independent acts of creation.\\n\\nAll the foregoing remarks on the inhabitants of oceanic islands,--namely,\\nthe scarcity of kinds--the richness in endemic forms in particular classes\\nor sections of classes,--the absence of whole groups, as of batrachians,\\nand of terrestrial mammals notwithstanding the presence of aГ«rial\\nbats,--the singular proportions of certain orders of plants,--herbaceous\\nforms having been developed into trees, &c.,--seem to me to accord better\\nwith the view of occasional means of transport having been largely\\nefficient in the long course of time, than with the view of all our oceanic\\nislands having been formerly connected by continuous land with the nearest\\ncontinent; for on this latter view the migration would probably have been\\nmore complete; and if modification be admitted, all the forms of life would\\nhave been more {397} equally modified, in accordance with the paramount\\nimportance of the relation of organism to organism.\\n\\nI do not deny that there are many and grave difficulties in understanding\\nhow several of the inhabitants of the more remote islands, whether still\\nretaining the same specific form or modified since their arrival, could\\nhave reached their present homes. But the probability of many islands\\nhaving existed as halting-places, of which not a wreck now remains, must\\nnot be overlooked. I will here give a single instance of one of the cases\\nof difficulty. Almost all oceanic islands, even the most isolated and\\nsmallest, are inhabited by land-shells, generally by endemic species, but\\nsometimes by species found elsewhere. Dr. Aug. A. Gould has given several\\ninteresting cases in regard to the land-shells of the islands of the\\nPacific. Now it is notorious that land-shells are very easily killed by\\nsalt; their eggs, at least such as I have tried, sink in sea-water and are\\nkilled by it. Yet there must be, on my view, some unknown, but highly\\nefficient means for their transportal. Would the just-hatched young\\noccasionally crawl on and adhere to the feet of birds roosting on the\\nground, and thus get transported? It occurred to me that land-shells, when\\nhybernating and having a membranous diaphragm over the mouth of the shell,\\nmight be floated in chinks of drifted timber across moderately wide arms of\\nthe sea. And I found that several species did in this state withstand\\nuninjured an immersion in sea-water during seven days: one of these shells\\nwas the Helix pomatia, and after it had again hybernated I put it in\\nsea-water for twenty days, and it perfectly recovered. As this species has\\na thick calcareous operculum, I removed it, and when it had formed a new\\nmembranous one, I immersed it for fourteen days in sea-water, and it\\nrecovered and crawled away: but more experiments are wanted on this head.\\n{398}\\n\\nThe most striking and important fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of\\nislands, is their affinity to those of the nearest mainland, without being\\nactually the same species. Numerous instances could be given of this fact.\\nI will give only one, that of the Galapagos Archipelago, situated under the\\nequator, between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of South America. Here\\nalmost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakeable stamp of\\nthe American continent. There are twenty-six land-birds, and twenty-five of\\nthese are ranked by Mr. Gould as distinct species, supposed to have been\\ncreated here; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to American\\nspecies in every character, in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice,\\nwas manifest. So it is with the other animals, and with nearly all the\\nplants, as shown by Dr. Hooker in his admirable memoir on the Flora of this\\narchipelago. The naturalist, looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic\\nislands in the Pacific, distant several hundred miles from the continent,\\nyet feels that he is standing on American land. Why should this be so? why\\nshould the species which are supposed to have been created in the Galapagos\\nArchipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those\\ncreated in America? There is nothing in the conditions of life, in the\\ngeological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in the\\nproportions in which the several classes are associated together, which\\nresembles closely the conditions of the South American coast: in fact there\\nis a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. On the other hand,\\nthere is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the\\nsoil, in climate, height, and size of the islands, between the Galapagos\\nand Cape de Verde Archipelagos: but what an entire and absolute difference\\nin their inhabitants! The inhabitants of the Cape de Verde Islands are\\nrelated to {399} those of Africa, like those of the Galapagos to America. I\\nbelieve this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary\\nview of independent creation; whereas on the view here maintained, it is\\nobvious that the Galapagos Islands would be likely to receive colonists,\\nwhether by occasional means of transport or by formerly continuous land,\\nfrom America; and the Cape de Verde Islands from Africa; and that such\\ncolonists would be liable to modification;--the principle of inheritance\\nstill betraying their original birthplace.\\n\\nMany analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost universal rule\\nthat the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the nearest\\ncontinent, or of other near islands. The exceptions are few, and most of\\nthem can be explained. Thus the plants of Kerguelen Land, though standing\\nnearer to Africa than to America, are related, and that very closely, as we\\nknow from Dr. Hooker\\'s account, to those of America: but on the view that\\nthis island has been mainly stocked by seeds brought with earth and stones\\non icebergs, drifted by the prevailing currents, this anomaly disappears.\\nNew Zealand in its endemic plants is much more closely related to\\nAustralia, the nearest mainland, than to any other region: and this is what\\nmight have been expected; but it is also plainly related to South America,\\nwhich, although the next nearest continent, is so enormously remote, that\\nthe fact becomes an anomaly. But this difficulty almost disappears on the\\nview that both New Zealand, South America, and other southern lands were\\nlong ago partially stocked from a nearly intermediate though distant point,\\nnamely from the antarctic islands, when they were clothed with vegetation,\\nbefore the commencement of the Glacial period. The affinity, which, though\\nfeeble, I am assured by Dr. Hooker is real, between the flora of the\\nsouth-western corner of Australia and of the Cape of Good {400} Hope, is a\\nfar more remarkable case, and is at present inexplicable: but this affinity\\nis confined to the plants, and will, I do not doubt, be some day explained.\\n\\nThe law which causes the inhabitants of an archipelago, though specifically\\ndistinct, to be closely allied to those of the nearest continent, we\\nsometimes see displayed on a small scale, yet in a most interesting manner,\\nwithin the limits of the same archipelago. Thus the several islands of the\\nGalapagos Archipelago are tenanted, as I have elsewhere shown, in a quite\\nmarvellous manner, by very closely related species; so that the inhabitants\\nof each separate island, though mostly distinct, are related in an\\nincomparably closer degree to each other than to the inhabitants of any\\nother part of the world. And this is just what might have been expected on\\nmy view, for the islands are situated so near each other that they would\\nalmost certainly receive immigrants from the same original source, or from\\neach other. But this dissimilarity between the endemic inhabitants of the\\nislands may be used as an argument against my views; for it may be asked,\\nhow has it happened in the several islands situated within sight of each\\nother, having the same geological nature, the same height, climate, &c.,\\nthat many of the immigrants should have been differently modified, though\\nonly in a small degree. This long appeared to me a great difficulty: but it\\narises in chief part from the deeply-seated error of considering the\\nphysical conditions of a country as the most important for its inhabitants;\\nwhereas it cannot, I think, be disputed that the nature of the other\\ninhabitants, with which each has to compete, is as least as important, and\\ngenerally a far more important element of success. Now if we look to those\\ninhabitants of the Galapagos Archipelago which are found in other parts of\\nthe world (laying on one side for the moment the {401} endemic species,\\nwhich cannot be here fairly included, as we are considering how they have\\ncome to be modified since their arrival), we find a considerable amount of\\ndifference in the several islands. This difference might indeed have been\\nexpected on the view of the islands having been stocked by occasional means\\nof transport--a seed, for instance, of one plant having been brought to one\\nisland, and that of another plant to another island. Hence when in former\\ntimes an immigrant settled on any one or more of the islands, or when it\\nsubsequently spread from one island to another, it would undoubtedly be\\nexposed to different conditions of life in the different islands, for it\\nwould have to compete with different sets of organisms: a plant for\\ninstance, would find the best-fitted ground more perfectly occupied by\\ndistinct plants in one island than in another, and it would be exposed to\\nthe attacks of somewhat different enemies. If then it varied, natural\\nselection would probably favour different varieties in the different\\nislands. Some species, however, might spread and yet retain the same\\ncharacter throughout the group, just as we see on continents some species\\nspreading widely and remaining the same.\\n\\nThe really surprising fact in this case of the Galapagos Archipelago, and\\nin a lesser degree in some analogous instances, is that the new species\\nformed in the separate islands have not quickly spread to the other\\nislands. But the islands, though in sight of each other, are separated by\\ndeep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than the British Channel, and\\nthere is no reason to suppose that they have at any former period been\\ncontinuously united. The currents of the sea are rapid and sweep across the\\narchipelago, and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare; so that the\\nislands are far more effectually separated from each other than they appear\\nto be on a map. Nevertheless a good many {402} species, both those found in\\nother parts of the world and those confined to the archipelago, are common\\nto the several islands, and we may infer from certain facts that these have\\nprobably spread from some one island to the others. But we often take, I\\nthink, an erroneous view of the probability of closely-allied species\\ninvading each other\\'s territory, when put into free intercommunication.\\nUndoubtedly if one species has any advantage whatever over another, it will\\nin a very brief time wholly or in part supplant it; but if both are equally\\nwell fitted for their own places in nature, both probably will hold their\\nown places and keep separate for almost any length of time. Being familiar\\nwith the fact that many species, naturalised through man\\'s agency, have\\nspread with astonishing rapidity over new countries, we are apt to infer\\nthat most species would thus spread; but we should remember that the forms\\nwhich become naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied\\nto the aboriginal inhabitants, but are very distinct species, belonging in\\na large proportion of cases, as shown by Alph. de Candolle, to distinct\\ngenera. In the Galapagos Archipelago, many even of the birds, though so\\nwell adapted for flying from island to island, are distinct on each; thus\\nthere are three closely-allied species of mocking-thrush, each confined to\\nits own island. Now let us suppose the mocking-thrush of Chatham Island to\\nbe blown to Charles Island, which has its own mocking-thrush: why should it\\nsucceed in establishing itself there? We may safely infer that Charles\\nIsland is well stocked with its own species, for annually more eggs are\\nlaid there than can possibly be reared; and we may infer that the\\nmocking-thrush peculiar to Charles Island is at least as well fitted for\\nits home as is the species peculiar to Chatham Island. Sir C. Lyell and Mr.\\nWollaston have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this {403}\\nsubject; namely, that Madeira and the adjoining islet of Porto Santo\\npossess many distinct but representative land-shells, some of which live in\\ncrevices of stone; and although large quantities of stone are annually\\ntransported from Porto Santo to Madeira, yet this latter island has not\\nbecome colonised by the Porto Santo species: nevertheless both islands have\\nbeen colonised by some European land-shells, which no doubt had some\\nadvantage over the indigenous species. From these considerations I think we\\nneed not greatly marvel at the endemic and representative species, which\\ninhabit the several islands of the Galapagos Archipelago, not having\\nuniversally spread from island to island. In many other instances, as in\\nthe several districts of the same continent, pre-occupation has probably\\nplayed an important part in checking the commingling of species under the\\nsame conditions of life. Thus, the south-east and south-west corners of\\nAustralia have nearly the same physical conditions, and are united by\\ncontinuous land, yet they are inhabited by a vast number of distinct\\nmammals, birds, and plants.\\n\\nThe principle which determines the general character of the fauna and flora\\nof oceanic islands, namely, that the inhabitants, when not identically the\\nsame, yet are plainly related to the inhabitants of that region whence\\ncolonists could most readily have been derived,--the colonists having been\\nsubsequently modified and better fitted to their new homes,--is of the\\nwidest application throughout nature. We see this on every mountain, in\\nevery lake and marsh. For Alpine species, excepting in so far as the same\\nforms, chiefly of plants, have spread widely throughout the world during\\nthe recent Glacial epoch, are related to those of the surrounding\\nlowlands;--thus we have in South America, Alpine humming-birds, Alpine\\nrodents, Alpine plants, {404} &c., all of strictly American forms, and it\\nis obvious that a mountain, as it became slowly upheaved, would naturally\\nbe colonised from the surrounding lowlands. So it is with the inhabitants\\nof lakes and marshes, excepting in so far as great facility of transport\\nhas given the same general forms to the whole world. We see this same\\nprinciple in the blind animals inhabiting the caves of America and of\\nEurope. Other analogous facts could be given. And it will, I believe, be\\nuniversally found to be true, that wherever in two regions, let them be\\never so distant, many closely-allied or representative species occur, there\\nwill likewise be found some identical species, showing, in accordance with\\nthe foregoing view, that at some former period there has been\\nintercommunication or migration between the two regions. And wherever many\\nclosely-allied species occur, there will be found many forms which some\\nnaturalists rank as distinct species, and some as varieties; these doubtful\\nforms showing us the steps in the process of modification.\\n\\nThis relation between the power and extent of migration of a species,\\neither at the present time or at some former period under different\\nphysical conditions, and the existence at remote points of the world of\\nother species allied to it, is shown in another and more general way. Mr.\\nGould remarked to me long ago, that in those genera of birds which range\\nover the world, many of the species have very wide ranges. I can hardly\\ndoubt that this rule is generally true, though it would be difficult to\\nprove it. Amongst mammals, we see it strikingly displayed in Bats, and in a\\nlesser degree in the FelidГ¦ and CanidГ¦. We see it, if we compare the\\ndistribution of butterflies and beetles. So it is with most fresh-water\\nproductions, in which so many genera range over the world, and many\\nindividual species have {405} enormous ranges. It is not meant that in\\nworld-ranging genera all the species have a wide range, or even that they\\nhave on an _average_ a wide range; but only that some of the species range\\nvery widely; for the facility with which widely-ranging species vary and\\ngive rise to new forms will largely determine their average range. For\\ninstance, two varieties of the same species inhabit America and Europe, and\\nthe species thus has an immense range; but, if the variation had been a\\nlittle greater, the two varieties would have been ranked as distinct\\nspecies, and the common range would have been greatly reduced. Still less\\nis it meant, that a species which apparently has the capacity of crossing\\nbarriers and ranging widely, as in the case of certain powerfully-winged\\nbirds, will necessarily range widely; for we should never forget that to\\nrange widely implies not only the power of crossing barriers, but the more\\nimportant power of being victorious in distant lands in the struggle for\\nlife with foreign associates. But on the view of all the species of a genus\\nhaving descended from a single parent, though now distributed to the most\\nremote points of the world, we ought to find, and I believe as a general\\nrule we do find, that some at least of the species range very widely; for\\nit is necessary that the unmodified parent should range widely, undergoing\\nmodification during its diffusion, and should place itself under diverse\\nconditions favourable for the conversion of its offspring, firstly into new\\nvarieties and ultimately into new species.\\n\\nIn considering the wide distribution of certain genera, we should bear in\\nmind that some are extremely ancient, and must have branched off from a\\ncommon parent at a remote epoch; so that in such cases there will have been\\nample time for great climatal and geographical changes and for accidents of\\ntransport; and consequently for the migration of some of the species into\\nall {406} quarters of the world, where they may have become slightly\\nmodified in relation to their new conditions. There is, also, some reason\\nto believe from geological evidence that organisms low in the scale within\\neach great class, generally change at a slower rate than the higher forms;\\nand consequently the lower forms will have had a better chance of ranging\\nwidely and of still retaining the same specific character. This fact,\\ntogether with the seeds and eggs of many low forms being very minute and\\nbetter fitted for distant transportation, probably accounts for a law which\\nhas long been observed, and which has lately been admirably discussed by\\nAlph. de Candolle in regard to plants, namely, that the lower any group of\\norganisms is, the more widely it is apt to range.\\n\\nThe relations just discussed,--namely, low and slowly-changing organisms\\nranging more widely than the high,--some of the species of widely-ranging\\ngenera themselves ranging widely,--such facts, as alpine, lacustrine, and\\nmarsh productions being related (with the exceptions before specified) to\\nthose on the surrounding low lands and dry lands, though these stations are\\nso different,--the very close relation of the distinct species which\\ninhabit the islets of the same archipelago,--and especially the striking\\nrelation of the inhabitants of each whole archipelago or island to those of\\nthe nearest mainland,--are, I think, utterly inexplicable on the ordinary\\nview of the independent creation of each species, but are explicable on the\\nview of colonisation from the nearest or readiest source, together with the\\nsubsequent modification and better adaptation of the colonists to their new\\nhomes.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Summary of last and present Chapters._--In these chapters I have\\nendeavoured to show, that if we make due allowance for our ignorance of the\\nfull effects of all {407} the changes of climate and of the level of the\\nland, which have certainly occurred within the recent period, and of other\\nsimilar changes which may have occurred within the same period; if we\\nremember how profoundly ignorant we are with respect to the many and\\ncurious means of occasional transport,--a subject which has hardly ever\\nbeen properly experimentised on; if we bear in mind how often a species may\\nhave ranged continuously over a wide area, and then have become extinct in\\nthe intermediate tracts, I think the difficulties in believing that all the\\nindividuals of the same species, wherever located, have descended from the\\nsame parents, are not insuperable. And we are led to this conclusion, which\\nhas been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single\\ncentres of creation, by some general considerations, more especially from\\nthe importance of barriers and from the analogical distribution of\\nsub-genera, genera, and families.\\n\\nWith respect to the distinct species of the same genus, which on my theory\\nmust have spread from one parent-source; if we make the same allowances as\\nbefore for our ignorance, and remember that some forms of life change most\\nslowly, enormous periods of time being thus granted for their migration, I\\ndo not think that the difficulties are insuperable; though they often are\\nin this case, and in that of the individuals of the same species, extremely\\ngreat.\\n\\nAs exemplifying the effects of climatal changes on distribution, I have\\nattempted to show how important has been the influence of the modern\\nGlacial period, which I am fully convinced simultaneously affected the\\nwhole world, or at least great meridional belts. As showing how diversified\\nare the means of occasional transport, I have discussed at some little\\nlength the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions. {408}\\n\\nIf the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long course\\nof time the individuals of the same species, and likewise of allied\\nspecies, have proceeded from some one source; then I think all the grand\\nleading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of\\nmigration (generally of the more dominant forms of life), together with\\nsubsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. We can thus\\nunderstand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which\\nseparate our several zoological and botanical provinces. We can thus\\nunderstand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; and how it\\nis that under different latitudes, for instance in South America, the\\ninhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and\\ndeserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are\\nlikewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same\\ncontinent. Bearing in mind that the mutual relation of organism to organism\\nis of the highest importance, we can see why two areas having nearly the\\nsame physical conditions should often be inhabited by very different forms\\nof life; for according to the length of time which has elapsed since new\\ninhabitants entered one region; according to the nature of the\\ncommunication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter, either\\nin greater or lesser numbers; according or not, as those which entered\\nhappened to come in more or less direct competition with each other and\\nwith the aborigines; and according as the immigrants were capable of\\nvarying more or less rapidly, there would ensue in different regions,\\nindependently of their physical conditions, infinitely diversified\\nconditions of life,--there would be an almost endless amount of organic\\naction and reaction,--and we should find, as we do find, some groups of\\nbeings greatly, and some only slightly modified,--some {409} developed in\\ngreat force, some existing in scanty numbers--in the different great\\ngeographical provinces of the world.\\n\\nOn these same principles, we can understand, as I have endeavoured to show,\\nwhy oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great\\nnumber should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in relation to the means of\\nmigration, one group of beings, even within the same class, should have all\\nits species endemic, and another group should have all its species common\\nto other quarters of the world. We can see why whole groups of organisms,\\nas batrachians and terrestrial mammals, should be absent from oceanic\\nislands, whilst the most isolated islands possess their own peculiar\\nspecies of aГ«rial mammals or bats. We can see why there should be some\\nrelation between the presence of mammals, in a more or less modified\\ncondition, and the depth of the sea between an island and the mainland. We\\ncan clearly see why all the inhabitants of an archipelago, though\\nspecifically distinct on the several islets, should be closely related to\\neach other, and likewise be related, but less closely, to those of the\\nnearest continent or other source whence immigrants were probably derived.\\nWe can see why in two areas, however distant from each other, there should\\nbe a correlation, in the presence of identical species, of varieties, of\\ndoubtful species, and of distinct but representative species.\\n\\nAs the late Edward Forbes often insisted, there is a striking parallelism\\nin the laws of life throughout time and space: the laws governing the\\nsuccession of forms in past times being nearly the same with those\\ngoverning at the present time the differences in different areas. We see\\nthis in many facts. The endurance of each species and group of species is\\ncontinuous in time; for the exceptions to the rule are so few, that they\\nmay {410} fairly be attributed to our not having as yet discovered in an\\nintermediate deposit the forms which are therein absent, but which occur\\nabove and below: so in space, it certainly is the general rule that the\\narea inhabited by a single species, or by a group of species, is\\ncontinuous; and the exceptions, which are not rare, may, as I have\\nattempted to show, be accounted for by migration at some former period\\nunder different conditions or by occasional means of transport, and by the\\nspecies having become extinct in the intermediate tracts. Both in time and\\nspace, species and groups of species have their points of maximum\\ndevelopment. Groups of species, belonging either to a certain period of\\ntime, or to a certain area, are often characterised by trifling characters\\nin common, as of sculpture or colour. In looking to the long succession of\\nages, as in now looking to distant provinces throughout the world, we find\\nthat some organisms differ little, whilst others belonging to a different\\nclass, or to a different order, or even only to a different family of the\\nsame order, differ greatly. In both time and space the lower members of\\neach class generally change less than the higher; but there are in both\\ncases marked exceptions to the rule. On my theory these several relations\\nthroughout time and space are intelligible; for whether we look to the\\nforms of life which have changed during successive ages within the same\\nquarter of the world, or to those which have changed after having migrated\\ninto distant quarters, in both cases the forms within each class have been\\nconnected by the same bond of ordinary generation; and the more nearly any\\ntwo forms are related in blood, the nearer they will generally stand to\\neach other in time and space; in both cases the laws of variation have been\\nthe same, and modifications have been accumulated by the same power of\\nnatural selection.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{411}\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII.\\n\\nMUTUAL AFFINITIES OF ORGANIC BEINGS: MORPHOLOGY: EMBRYOLOGY: RUDIMENTARY\\nORGANS.\\n\\n    CLASSIFICATION, groups subordinate to groups--Natural system--Rules and\\n    difficulties in classification, explained on the theory of descent with\\n    modification--Classification of varieties--Descent always used in\\n    classification--Analogical or adaptive characters--Affinities, general,\\n    complex and radiating--Extinction separates and defines\\n    groups--MORPHOLOGY, between members of the same class, between parts of\\n    the same individual--EMBRYOLOGY, laws of, explained by variations not\\n    supervening at an early age, and being inherited at a corresponding\\n    age--RUDIMENTARY ORGANS; their origin explained--Summary.\\n\\nFrom the first dawn of life, all organic beings are found to resemble each\\nother in descending degrees, so that they can be classed in groups under\\ngroups. This classification is evidently not arbitrary like the grouping of\\nthe stars in constellations. The existence of groups would have been of\\nsimple signification, if one group had been exclusively fitted to inhabit\\nthe land, and another the water; one to feed on flesh, another on vegetable\\nmatter, and so on; but the case is widely different in nature; for it is\\nnotorious how commonly members of even the same sub-group have different\\nhabits. In our second and fourth chapters, on Variation and on Natural\\nSelection, I have attempted to show that it is the widely ranging, the much\\ndiffused and common, that is the dominant species belonging to the larger\\ngenera, which vary most. The varieties, or incipient species, thus produced\\nultimately become converted, as I believe, into new and distinct species;\\nand these, on the principle of inheritance, tend to produce other new and\\ndominant {412} species. Consequently the groups which are now large, and\\nwhich generally include many dominant species, tend to go on increasing\\nindefinitely in size. I further attempted to show that from the varying\\ndescendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as different\\nplaces as possible in the economy of nature, there is a constant tendency\\nin their characters to diverge. This conclusion was supported by looking at\\nthe great diversity of the forms of life which, in any small area, come\\ninto the closest competition, and by looking to certain facts in\\nnaturalisation.\\n\\nI attempted also to show that there is a constant tendency in the forms\\nwhich are increasing in number and diverging in character, to supplant and\\nexterminate the less divergent, the less improved, and preceding forms. I\\nrequest the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action, as\\nformerly explained, of these several principles; and he will see that the\\ninevitable result is that the modified descendants proceeding from one\\nprogenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups. In the\\ndiagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus including\\nseveral species; and all the genera on this line form together one class,\\nfor all have descended from one ancient but unseen parent, and,\\nconsequently, have inherited something in common. But the three genera on\\nthe left hand have, on this same principle, much in common, and form a\\nsub-family, distinct from that including the next two genera on the right\\nhand, which diverged from a common parent at the fifth stage of descent.\\nThese five genera have also much, though less, in common; and they form a\\nfamily distinct from that including the three genera still further to the\\nright hand, which diverged at a still earlier period. And all these genera,\\ndescended from (A), form an order distinct from the {413} genera descended\\nfrom (I). So that we here have many species descended from a single\\nprogenitor grouped into genera; and the genera are included in, or\\nsubordinate to, sub-families, families, and orders, all united into one\\nclass. Thus, the grand fact in natural history of the subordination of\\ngroup under group, which, from its familiarity, does not always\\nsufficiently strike us, is in my judgment explained.\\n\\nNaturalists try to arrange the species, genera, and families in each class,\\non what is called the Natural System. But what is meant by this system?\\nSome authors look at it merely as a scheme for arranging together those\\nliving objects which are most alike, and for separating those which are\\nmost unlike; or as an artificial means for enunciating, as briefly as\\npossible, general propositions,--that is, by one sentence to give the\\ncharacters common, for instance, to all mammals, by another those common to\\nall carnivora, by another those common to the dog-genus, and then by adding\\na single sentence, a full description is given of each kind of dog. The\\ningenuity and utility of this system are indisputable. But many naturalists\\nthink that something more is meant by the Natural System; they believe that\\nit reveals the plan of the Creator; but unless it be specified whether\\norder in time or space, or what else is meant by the plan of the Creator,\\nit seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge. Such\\nexpressions as that famous one of LinnГ¦us, and which we often meet with in\\na more or less concealed form, that the characters do not make the genus,\\nbut that the genus gives the characters, seem to imply that something more\\nis included in our classification, than mere resemblance. I believe that\\nsomething more is included; and that propinquity of descent,--the only\\nknown cause of the similarity of organic beings,--is the bond, hidden as it\\nis by various degrees of {414} modification, which is partially revealed to\\nus by our classifications.\\n\\nLet us now consider the rules followed in classification, and the\\ndifficulties which are encountered on the view that classification either\\ngives some unknown plan of creation, or is simply a scheme for enunciating\\ngeneral propositions and of placing together the forms most like each\\nother. It might have been thought (and was in ancient times thought) that\\nthose parts of the structure which determined the habits of life, and the\\ngeneral place of each being in the economy of nature, would be of very high\\nimportance in classification. Nothing can be more false. No one regards the\\nexternal similarity of a mouse to a shrew, of a dugong to a whale, of a\\nwhale to a fish, as of any importance. These resemblances, though so\\nintimately connected with the whole life of the being, are ranked as merely\\n\"adaptive or analogical characters;\" but to the consideration of these\\nresemblances we shall have to recur. It may even be given as a general\\nrule, that the less any part of the organisation is concerned with special\\nhabits, the more important it becomes for classification. As an instance:\\nOwen, in speaking of the dugong, says, \"The generative organs being those\\nwhich are most remotely related to the habits and food of an animal, I have\\nalways regarded as affording very clear indications of its true affinities.\\nWe are least likely in the modifications of these organs to mistake a\\nmerely adaptive for an essential character.\" So with plants, how remarkable\\nit is that the organs of vegetation, on which their whole life depends, are\\nof little signification, excepting in the first main divisions; whereas the\\norgans of reproduction, with their product the seed, are of paramount\\nimportance!\\n\\nWe must not, therefore, in classifying, trust to resemblances in parts of\\nthe organisation, however important {415} they may be for the welfare of\\nthe being in relation to the outer world. Perhaps from this cause it has\\npartly arisen, that almost all naturalists lay the greatest stress on\\nresemblances in organs of high vital or physiological importance. No doubt\\nthis view of the classificatory importance of organs which are important is\\ngenerally, but by no means always, true. But their importance for\\nclassification, I believe, depends on their greater constancy throughout\\nlarge groups of species; and this constancy depends on such organs having\\ngenerally been subjected to less change in the adaptation of the species to\\ntheir conditions of life. That the mere physiological importance of an\\norgan does not determine its classificatory value, is almost shown by the\\none fact, that in allied groups, in which the same organ, as we have every\\nreason to suppose, has nearly the same physiological value, its\\nclassificatory value is widely different. No naturalist can have worked at\\nany group without being struck with this fact; and it has been fully\\nacknowledged in the writings of almost every author. It will suffice to\\nquote the highest authority, Robert Brown, who in speaking of certain\\norgans in the ProteaceГ¦, says their generic importance, \"like that of all\\ntheir parts, not only in this but, as I apprehend, in every natural family,\\nis very unequal, and in some cases seems to be entirely lost.\" Again in\\nanother work he says, the genera of the ConnaraceГ¦ \"differ in having one or\\nmore ovaria, in the existence or absence of albumen, in the imbricate or\\nvalvular Г¦stivation. Any one of these characters singly is frequently of\\nmore than generic importance, though here even when all taken together they\\nappear insufficient to separate Cnestis from Connarus.\" To give an example\\namongst insects, in one great division of the Hymenoptera, the antennГ¦, as\\nWestwood has remarked, are most constant in structure; {416} in another\\ndivision they differ much, and the differences are of quite subordinate\\nvalue in classification; yet no one probably will say that the antennae in\\nthese two divisions of the same order are of unequal physiological\\nimportance. Any number of instances could be given of the varying\\nimportance for classification of the same important organ within the same\\ngroup of beings.\\n\\nAgain, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high\\nphysiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs in this\\ncondition are often of high value in classification. No one will dispute\\nthat the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants, and\\ncertain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly serviceable in exhibiting\\nthe close affinity between Ruminants and Pachyderms. Robert Brown has\\nstrongly insisted on the fact that the rudimentary florets are of the\\nhighest importance in the classification of the Grasses.\\n\\nNumerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts which\\nmust be considered of very trifling physiological importance, but which are\\nuniversally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition of whole\\ngroups. For instance, whether or not there is an open passage from the\\nnostrils to the mouth, the only character, according to Owen, which\\nabsolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles--the inflection of the angle\\nof the jaws in Marsupials--the manner in which the wings of insects are\\nfolded--mere colour in certain AlgГ¦--mere pubescence on parts of the flower\\nin grasses--the nature of the dermal covering, as hair or feathers, in the\\nVertebrata. If the Ornithorhynchus had been covered with feathers instead\\nof hair, this external and trifling character would, I think, have been\\nconsidered by naturalists as important an aid in determining the degree of\\naffinity of this strange creature to {417} birds and reptiles, as an\\napproach in structure in any one internal and important organ.\\n\\nThe importance, for classification, of trifling characters, mainly depends\\non their being correlated with several other characters of more or less\\nimportance. The value indeed of an aggregate of characters is very evident\\nin natural history. Hence, as has often been remarked, a species may depart\\nfrom its allies in several characters, both of high physiological\\nimportance and of almost universal prevalence, and yet leave us in no doubt\\nwhere it should be ranked. Hence, also, it has been found, that a\\nclassification founded on any single character, however important that may\\nbe, has always failed; for no part of the organisation is universally\\nconstant. The importance of an aggregate of characters, even when none are\\nimportant, alone explains, I think, that saying of LinnГ¦us, that the\\ncharacters do not give the genus, but the genus gives the characters; for\\nthis saying seems founded on an appreciation of many trifling points of\\nresemblance, too slight to be defined. Certain plants, belonging to the\\nMalpighiaceГ¦, bear perfect and degraded flowers; in the latter, as A. de\\nJussieu has remarked, \"the greater number of the characters proper to the\\nspecies, to the genus, to the family, to the class, disappear, and thus\\nlaugh at our classification.\" But when Aspicarpa produced in France, during\\nseveral years, only degraded flowers, departing so wonderfully in a number\\nof the most important points of structure from the proper type of the\\norder, yet M. Richard sagaciously saw, as Jussieu observes, that this genus\\nshould still be retained amongst the MalpighiaceГ¦. This case seems to me\\nwell to illustrate the spirit with which our classifications are sometimes\\nnecessarily founded.\\n\\nPractically when naturalists are at work, they do {418} not trouble\\nthemselves about the physiological value of the characters which they use\\nin defining a group, or in allocating any particular species. If they find\\na character nearly uniform, and common to a great number of forms, and not\\ncommon to others, they use it as one of high value; if common to some\\nlesser number, they use it as of subordinate value. This principle has been\\nbroadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one; and by none more\\nclearly than by that excellent botanist, Aug. St. Hilaire. If certain\\ncharacters are always found correlated with others, though no apparent bond\\nof connexion can be discovered between them, especial value is set on them.\\nAs in most groups of animals, important organs, such as those for\\npropelling the blood, or for aГ«rating it, or those for propagating the\\nrace, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as highly serviceable\\nin classification; but in some groups of animals all these, the most\\nimportant vital organs, are found to offer characters of quite subordinate\\nvalue.\\n\\nWe can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal\\nimportance with those derived from the adult, for our classifications of\\ncourse include all ages of each species. But it is by no means obvious, on\\nthe ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo should be more important\\nfor this purpose than that of the adult, which alone plays its full part in\\nthe economy of nature. Yet it has been strongly urged by those great\\nnaturalists, Milne Edwards and Agassiz, that embryonic characters are the\\nmost important of any in the classification of animals; and this doctrine\\nhas very generally been admitted as true. The same fact holds good with\\nflowering plants, of which the two main divisions have been founded on\\ncharacters derived from the embryo,--on the number and position of the\\n{419} embryonic leaves or cotyledons, and on the mode of development of the\\nplumule and radicle. In our discussion on embryology, we shall see why such\\ncharacters are so valuable, on the view of classification tacitly including\\nthe idea of descent.\\n\\nOur classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of affinities.\\nNothing can be easier than to define a number of characters common to all\\nbirds; but in the case of crustaceans, such definition has hitherto been\\nfound impossible. There are crustaceans at the opposite ends of the series,\\nwhich have hardly a character in common; yet the species at both ends, from\\nbeing plainly allied to others, and these to others, and so onwards, can be\\nrecognised as unequivocally belonging to this, and to no other class of the\\nArticulata.\\n\\nGeographical distribution has often been used, though perhaps not quite\\nlogically, in classification, more especially in very large groups of\\nclosely allied forms. Temminck insists on the utility or even necessity of\\nthis practice in certain groups of birds; and it has been followed by\\nseveral entomologists and botanists.\\n\\nFinally, with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of\\nspecies, such as orders, sub-orders, families, sub-families, and genera,\\nthey seem to be, at least at present, almost arbitrary. Several of the best\\nbotanists, such as Mr. Bentham and others, have strongly insisted on their\\narbitrary value. Instances could be given amongst plants and insects, of a\\ngroup of forms, first ranked by practised naturalists as only a genus, and\\nthen raised to the rank of a sub-family or family; and this has been done,\\nnot because further research has detected important structural differences,\\nat first overlooked, but because numerous allied species, with slightly\\ndifferent grades of difference, have been subsequently discovered. {420}\\n\\nAll the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are\\nexplained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural\\nsystem is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which\\nnaturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more\\nspecies, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in\\nso far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent\\nis the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and\\nnot some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general\\npropositions, and the mere putting together and separating objects more or\\nless alike.\\n\\nBut I must explain my meaning more fully. I believe that the _arrangement_\\nof the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to the\\nother groups, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but\\nthat the _amount_ of difference in the several branches or groups, though\\nallied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may differ\\ngreatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which they have\\nundergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different\\ngenera, families, sections, or orders. The reader will best understand what\\nis meant, if he will take the trouble of referring to the diagram in the\\nfourth chapter. We will suppose the letters A to L to represent allied\\ngenera, which lived during the Silurian epoch, and these have descended\\nfrom a species which existed at an unknown anterior period. Species of\\nthree of these genera (A, F, and I) have transmitted modified descendants\\nto the present day, represented by the fifteen genera (a^{14} to z^{14}) on\\nthe uppermost horizontal line. Now all these modified descendants from a\\nsingle species, are represented as related in blood or descent to the same\\n{421} degree; they may metaphorically be called cousins to the same\\nmillionth degree; yet they differ widely and in different degrees from each\\nother. The forms descended from A, now broken up into two or three\\nfamilies, constitute a distinct order from those descended from I, also\\nbroken up into two families. Nor can the existing species, descended from\\nA, be ranked in the same genus with the parent A; or those from I, with the\\nparent I. But the existing genus F^{14} may be supposed to have been but\\nslightly modified; and it will then rank with the parent-genus F; just as\\nsome few still living organic beings belong to Silurian genera. So that the\\namount or value of the differences between organic beings all related to\\neach other in the same degree in blood, has come to be widely different.\\nNevertheless their genealogical _arrangement_ remains strictly true, not\\nonly at the present time, but at each successive period of descent. All the\\nmodified descendants from A will have inherited something in common from\\ntheir common parent, as will all the descendants from I; so will it be with\\neach subordinate branch of descendants, at each successive period. If,\\nhowever, we choose to suppose that any of the descendants of A or of I have\\nbeen so much modified as to have more or less completely lost traces of\\ntheir parentage, in this case, their places in a natural classification\\nwill have been more or less completely lost,--as sometimes seems to have\\noccurred with existing organisms. All the descendants of the genus F, along\\nits whole line of descent, are supposed to have been but little modified,\\nand they yet form a single genus. But this genus, though much isolated,\\nwill still occupy its proper intermediate position; for F originally was\\nintermediate in character between A and I, and the several genera descended\\nfrom these two genera will {422} have inherited to a certain extent their\\ncharacters. This natural arrangement is shown, as far as is possible on\\npaper, in the diagram, but in much too simple a manner. If a branching\\ndiagram had not been used, and only the names of the groups had been\\nwritten in a linear series, it would have been still less possible to have\\ngiven a natural arrangement; and it is notoriously not possible to\\nrepresent in a series, on a flat surface, the affinities which we discover\\nin nature amongst the beings of the same group. Thus, on the view which I\\nhold, the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement, like a\\npedigree; but the degrees of modification which the different groups have\\nundergone, have to be expressed by ranking them under different so-called\\ngenera, sub-families, families, sections, orders, and classes.\\n\\nIt may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by taking\\nthe case of languages. If we possessed a perfect pedigree of mankind, a\\ngenealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the best\\nclassification of the various languages now spoken throughout the world;\\nand if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and slowly changing\\ndialects, had to be included, such an arrangement would, I think, be the\\nonly possible one. Yet it might be that some very ancient language had\\naltered little, and had given rise to few new languages, whilst others\\n(owing to the spreading and subsequent isolation and states of civilisation\\nof the several races, descended from a common race) had altered much, and\\nhad given rise to many new languages and dialects. The various degrees of\\ndifference in the languages from the same stock, would have to be expressed\\nby groups subordinate to groups; but the proper or even only possible\\narrangement would still be genealogical; and this would be strictly\\nnatural, as {423} it would connect together all languages, extinct and\\nmodern, by the closest affinities, and would give the filiation and origin\\nof each tongue.\\n\\nIn confirmation of this view, let us glance at the classification of\\nvarieties, which are believed or known to have descended from one species.\\nThese are grouped under species, with sub-varieties under varieties; and\\nwith our domestic productions, several other grades of difference are\\nrequisite, as we have seen with pigeons. The origin of the existence of\\ngroups subordinate to groups, is the same with varieties as with species,\\nnamely, closeness of descent with various degrees of modification. Nearly\\nthe same rules are followed in classifying varieties, as with species.\\nAuthors have insisted on the necessity of classing varieties on a natural\\ninstead of an artificial system; we are cautioned, for instance, not to\\nclass two varieties of the pine-apple together, merely because their fruit,\\nthough the most important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts\\nthe swedish and common turnips together, though the esculent and thickened\\nstems are so similar. Whatever part is found to be most constant, is used\\nin classing varieties: thus the great agriculturist Marshall says the horns\\nare very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are less\\nvariable than the shape or colour of the body, &c.; whereas with sheep the\\nhorns are much less serviceable, because less constant. In classing\\nvarieties, I apprehend if we had a real pedigree, a genealogical\\nclassification would be universally preferred; and it has been attempted by\\nsome authors. For we might feel sure, whether there had been more or less\\nmodification, the principle of inheritance would keep the forms together\\nwhich were allied in the greatest number of points. In tumbler pigeons,\\nthough some sub-varieties differ from the others {424} in the important\\ncharacter of having a longer beak, yet all are kept together from having\\nthe common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has nearly or quite\\nlost this habit; nevertheless, without any reasoning or thinking on the\\nsubject, these tumblers are kept in the same group, because allied in blood\\nand alike in some other respects. If it could be proved that the Hottentot\\nhad descended from the Negro, I think he would be classed under the Negro\\ngroup, however much he might differ in colour and other important\\ncharacters from negroes.\\n\\nWith species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact brought\\ndescent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest grade, or\\nthat of a species, the two sexes; and how enormously these sometimes differ\\nin the most important characters, is known to every naturalist: scarcely a\\nsingle fact can be predicated in common of the males and hermaphrodites of\\ncertain cirripedes, when adult, and yet no one dreams of separating them.\\nThe naturalist includes as one species the several larval stages of the\\nsame individual, however much they may differ from each other and from the\\nadult; as he likewise includes the so-called alternate generations of\\nSteenstrup, which can only in a technical sense be considered as the same\\nindividual. He includes monsters; he includes varieties, not solely because\\nthey closely resemble the parent-form, but because they are descended from\\nit. He who believes that the cowslip is descended from the primrose, or\\nconversely, ranks them together as a single species, and gives a single\\ndefinition. As soon as three Orchidean forms (Monochanthus, Myanthus, and\\nCatasetum), which had previously been ranked as three distinct genera, were\\nknown to be sometimes produced on the same spike, they were immediately\\nincluded as a single species. {425}\\n\\nAs descent has universally been used in classing together the individuals\\nof the same species, though the males and females and larvГ¦ are sometimes\\nextremely different; and as it has been used in classing varieties which\\nhave undergone a certain, and sometimes a considerable amount of\\nmodification, may not this same element of descent have been unconsciously\\nused in grouping species under genera, and genera under higher groups,\\nthough in these cases the modification has been greater in degree, and has\\ntaken a longer time to complete? I believe it has thus been unconsciously\\nused; and only thus can I understand the several rules and guides which\\nhave been followed by our best systematists. We have no written pedigrees;\\nwe have to make out community of descent by resemblances of any kind.\\nTherefore we choose those characters which, as far as we can judge, are the\\nleast likely to have been modified in relation to the conditions of life to\\nwhich each species has been recently exposed. Rudimentary structures on\\nthis view are as good as, or even sometimes better than, other parts of the\\norganisation. We care not how trifling a character may be--let it be the\\nmere inflection of the angle of the jaw, the manner in which an insect\\'s\\nwing is folded, whether the skin be covered by hair or feathers--if it\\nprevail throughout many and different species, especially those having very\\ndifferent habits of life, it assumes high value; for we can account for its\\npresence in so many forms with such different habits, only by its\\ninheritance from a common parent. We may err in this respect in regard to\\nsingle points of structure, but when several characters, let them be ever\\nso trifling, occur together throughout a large group of beings having\\ndifferent habits, we may feel almost sure, on the theory of descent, that\\nthese characters have been inherited from a common ancestor. {426} And we\\nknow that such correlated or aggregated characters have especial value in\\nclassification.\\n\\nWe can understand why a species or a group of species may depart, in\\nseveral of its most important characteristics, from its allies, and yet be\\nsafely classed with them. This may be safely done, and is often done, as\\nlong as a sufficient number of characters, let them be ever so unimportant,\\nbetrays the hidden bond of community of descent. Let two forms have not a\\nsingle character in common, yet if these extreme forms are connected\\ntogether by a chain of intermediate groups, we may at once infer their\\ncommunity of descent, and we put them all into the same class. As we find\\norgans of high physiological importance--those which serve to preserve life\\nunder the most diverse conditions of existence--are generally the most\\nconstant, we attach especial value to them; but if these same organs, in\\nanother group or section of a group, are found to differ much, we at once\\nvalue them less in our classification. We shall hereafter, I think, clearly\\nsee why embryological characters are of such high classificatory\\nimportance. Geographical distribution may sometimes be brought usefully\\ninto play in classing large and widely-distributed genera, because all the\\nspecies of the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and isolated region,\\nhave in all probability descended from the same parents.\\n\\nWe can understand, on these views, the very important distinction between\\nreal affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances. Lamarck first\\ncalled attention to this distinction, and he has been ably followed by\\nMacleay and others. The resemblance, in the shape of the body and in the\\nfin-like anterior limbs, between the dugong, which is a pachydermatous\\nanimal, and the whale, and between both these mammals and fishes, is\\nanalogical. Amongst insects there are innumerable {427} instances: thus\\nLinnГ¦us, misled by external appearances, actually classed an homopterous\\ninsect as a moth. We see something of the same kind even in our domestic\\nvarieties, as in the thickened stems of the common and swedish turnip. The\\nresemblance of the greyhound and racehorse is hardly more fanciful than the\\nanalogies which have been drawn by some authors between very distinct\\nanimals. On my view of characters being of real importance for\\nclassification, only in so far as they reveal descent, we can clearly\\nunderstand why analogical or adaptive character, although of the utmost\\nimportance to the welfare of the being, are almost valueless to the\\nsystematist. For animals, belonging to two most distinct lines of descent,\\nmay readily become adapted to similar conditions, and thus assume a close\\nexternal resemblance; but such resemblances will not reveal--will rather\\ntend to conceal their blood-relationship to their proper lines of descent.\\nWe can also understand the apparent paradox, that the very same characters\\nare analogical when one class or order is compared with another, but give\\ntrue affinities when the members of the same class or order are compared\\none with another: thus the shape of the body and fin-like limbs are only\\nanalogical when whales are compared with fishes, being adaptations in both\\nclasses for swimming through the water; but the shape of the body and\\nfin-like limbs serve as characters exhibiting true affinity between the\\nseveral members of the whale family; for these cetaceans agree in so many\\ncharacters, great and small, that we cannot doubt that they have inherited\\ntheir general shape of body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor.\\nSo it is with fishes.\\n\\nAs members of distinct classes have often been adapted by successive slight\\nmodifications to live under nearly similar circumstances,--to inhabit for\\ninstance {428} the three elements of land, air, and water,--we can perhaps\\nunderstand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimes been\\nobserved between the sub-groups in distinct classes. A naturalist, struck\\nby a parallelism of this nature in any one class, by arbitrarily raising or\\nsinking the value of the groups in other classes (and all our experience\\nshows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary), could easily extend\\nthe parallelism over a wide range; and thus the septenary, quinary,\\nquaternary, and ternary classifications have probably arisen.\\n\\nAs the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the larger\\ngenera, tend to inherit the advantages, which made the groups to which they\\nbelong large and their parents dominant, they are almost sure to spread\\nwidely, and to seize on more and more places in the economy of nature. The\\nlarger and more dominant groups thus tend to go on increasing in size; and\\nthey consequently supplant many smaller and feebler groups. Thus we can\\naccount for the fact that all organisms, recent and extinct, are included\\nunder a few great orders, under still fewer classes, and all in one great\\nnatural system. As showing how few the higher groups are in number, and how\\nwidely spread they are throughout the world, the fact is striking, that the\\ndiscovery of Australia has not added a single insect belonging to a new\\nclass; and that in the vegetable kingdom, as I learn from Dr. Hooker, it\\nhas added only two or three orders of small size.\\n\\nIn the chapter on geological succession I attempted to show, on the\\nprinciple of each group having generally diverged much in character during\\nthe long-continued process of modification, how it is that the more ancient\\nforms of life often present characters in some slight degree intermediate\\nbetween existing groups. A few {429} old and intermediate parent-forms\\nhaving occasionally transmitted to the present day descendants but little\\nmodified, will give to us our so-called osculant or aberrant groups. The\\nmore aberrant any form is, the greater must be the number of connecting\\nforms which on my theory have been exterminated and utterly lost. And we\\nhave some evidence of aberrant forms having suffered severely from\\nextinction, for they are generally represented by extremely few species;\\nand such species as do occur are generally very distinct from each other,\\nwhich again implies extinction. The genera Ornithorhynchus and Lepidosiren,\\nfor example, would not have been less aberrant had each been represented by\\na dozen species instead of by a single one; but such richness in species,\\nas I find after some investigation, does not commonly fall to the lot of\\naberrant genera. We can, I think, account for this fact only by looking at\\naberrant forms as failing groups conquered by more successful competitors,\\nwith a few members preserved by some unusual coincidence of favourable\\ncircumstances.\\n\\nMr. Waterhouse has remarked that, when a member belonging to one group of\\nanimals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group, this affinity in\\nmost cases is general and not special: thus, according to Mr. Waterhouse,\\nof all Rodents, the bizcacha is most nearly related to Marsupials; but in\\nthe points in which it approaches this order, its relations are general,\\nand not to any one marsupial species more than to another. As the points of\\naffinity of the bizcacha to Marsupials are believed to be real and not\\nmerely adaptive, they are due on my theory to inheritance in common.\\nTherefore we must suppose either that all Rodents, including the bizcacha,\\nbranched off from some very ancient Marsupial, which will have had a\\ncharacter in some degree intermediate with respect to all existing\\nMarsupials; or {430} that both Rodents and Marsupials branched off from a\\ncommon progenitor, and that both groups have since undergone much\\nmodification in divergent directions. On either view we may suppose that\\nthe bizcacha has retained, by inheritance, more of the character of its\\nancient progenitor than have other Rodents; and therefore it will not be\\nspecially related to any one existing Marsupial, but indirectly to all or\\nnearly all Marsupials, from having partially retained the character of\\ntheir common progenitor, or of an early member of the group. On the other\\nhand, of all Marsupials, as Mr. Waterhouse has remarked, the phascolomys\\nresembles most nearly, not any one species, but the general order of\\nRodents. In this case, however, it may be strongly suspected that the\\nresemblance is only analogical, owing to the phascolomys having become\\nadapted to habits like those of a Rodent. The elder De Candolle has made\\nnearly similar observations on the general nature of the affinities of\\ndistinct orders of plants.\\n\\nOn the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in character\\nof the species descended from a common parent, together with their\\nretention by inheritance of some characters in common, we can understand\\nthe excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all the members\\nof the same family or higher group are connected together. For the common\\nparent of a whole family of species, now broken up by extinction into\\ndistinct groups and sub-groups, will have transmitted some of its\\ncharacters, modified in various ways and degrees, to all; and the several\\nspecies will consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines of\\naffinity of various lengths (as may be seen in the diagram so often\\nreferred to), mounting up through many predecessors. As it is difficult to\\nshow the blood-relationship between the numerous kindred {431} of any\\nancient and noble family, even by the aid of a genealogical tree, and\\nalmost impossible to do this without this aid, we can understand the\\nextraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in describing,\\nwithout the aid of a diagram, the various affinities which they perceive\\nbetween the many living and extinct members of the same great natural\\nclass.\\n\\nExtinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an important\\npart in defining and widening the intervals between the several groups in\\neach class. We may thus account even for the distinctness of whole classes\\nfrom each other--for instance, of birds from all other vertebrate\\nanimals--by the belief that many ancient forms of life have been utterly\\nlost, through which the early progenitors of birds were formerly connected\\nwith the early progenitors of the other vertebrate classes. There has been\\nless entire extinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes\\nwith batrachians. There has been still less in some other classes, as in\\nthat of the Crustacea, for here the most wonderfully diverse forms are\\nstill tied together by a long, but broken, chain of affinities. Extinction\\nhas only separated groups: it has by no means made them; for if every form\\nwhich has ever lived on this earth were suddenly to reappear, though it\\nwould be quite impossible to give definitions by which each group could be\\ndistinguished from other groups, as all would blend together by steps as\\nfine as those between the finest existing varieties, nevertheless a natural\\nclassification, or at least a natural arrangement, would be possible. We\\nshall see this by turning to the diagram: the letters, A to L, may\\nrepresent eleven Silurian genera, some of which have produced large groups\\nof modified descendants. Every intermediate link between these eleven\\ngenera and their primordial parent, and every {432} intermediate link in\\neach branch and sub-branch of their descendants, may be supposed to be\\nstill alive; and the links to be as fine as those between the finest\\nvarieties. In this case it would be quite impossible to give any definition\\nby which the several members of the several groups could be distinguished\\nfrom their more immediate parents; or these parents from their ancient and\\nunknown progenitor. Yet the natural arrangement in the diagram would still\\nhold good; and, on the principle of inheritance, all the forms descended\\nfrom A, or from I, would have something in common. In a tree we can specify\\nthis or that branch, though at the actual fork the two unite and blend\\ntogether. We could not, as I have said, define the several groups; but we\\ncould pick out types, or forms, representing most of the characters of each\\ngroup, whether large or small, and thus give a general idea of the value of\\nthe differences between them. This is what we should be driven to, if we\\nwere ever to succeed in collecting all the forms in any class which have\\nlived throughout all time and space. We shall certainly never succeed in\\nmaking so perfect a collection: nevertheless, in certain classes, we are\\ntending in this direction; and Milne Edwards has lately insisted, in an\\nable paper, on the high importance of looking to types, whether or not we\\ncan separate and define the groups to which such types belong.\\n\\nFinally, we have seen that natural selection, which results from the\\nstruggle for existence, and which almost inevitably induces extinction and\\ndivergence of character in the many descendants from one dominant\\nparent-species, explains that great and universal feature in the affinities\\nof all organic beings, namely, their subordination in group under group. We\\nuse the element of descent in classing the individuals of both sexes and of\\nall ages, although having few characters in common, {433} under one\\nspecies; we use descent in classing acknowledged varieties, however\\ndifferent they may be from their parent; and I believe this element of\\ndescent is the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have sought under\\nthe term of the Natural System. On this idea of the natural system being,\\nin so far as it has been perfected, genealogical in its arrangement, with\\nthe grades of difference between the descendants from a common parent,\\nexpressed by the terms genera, families, orders, &c., we can understand the\\nrules which we are compelled to follow in our classification. We can\\nunderstand why we value certain resemblances far more than others; why we\\nare permitted to use rudimentary and useless organs, or others of trifling\\nphysiological importance; why, in comparing one group with a distinct\\ngroup, we summarily reject analogical or adaptive characters, and yet use\\nthese same characters within the limits of the same group. We can clearly\\nsee how it is that all living and extinct forms can be grouped together in\\none great system; and how the several members of each class are connected\\ntogether by the most complex and radiating lines of affinities. We shall\\nnever, probably, disentangle the inextricable web of affinities between the\\nmembers of any one class; but when we have a distinct object in view, and\\ndo not look to some unknown plan of creation, we may hope to make sure but\\nslow progress.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Morphology._--We have seen that the members of the same class,\\nindependently of their habits of life, resemble each other in the general\\nplan of their organisation. This resemblance is often expressed by the term\\n\"unity of type;\" or by saying that the several parts and organs in the\\ndifferent species of the class are homologous. The whole subject is\\nincluded under {434} the general name of Morphology. This is the most\\ninteresting department of natural history, and may be said to be its very\\nsoul. What can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for\\ngrasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of\\nthe porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the\\nsame pattern, and should include similar bones, in the same relative\\npositions? Geoffroy St. Hilaire has insisted strongly on the high\\nimportance of relative connexion in homologous organs: the parts may change\\nto almost any extent in form and size, and yet they always remain connected\\ntogether in the same order. We never find, for instance, the bones of the\\narm and forearm, or of the thigh and leg, transposed. Hence the same names\\ncan be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals. We see\\nthe same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects: what can\\nbe more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a\\nsphinx-moth, the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and the great jaws of\\na beetle?--yet all these organs, serving for such different purposes, are\\nformed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip, mandibles, and\\ntwo pairs of maxillГ¦. Analogous laws govern the construction of the mouths\\nand limbs of crustaceans. So it is with the flowers of plants.\\n\\nNothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity of\\npattern in members of the same class, by utility or by the doctrine of\\nfinal causes. The hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly admitted\\nby Owen in his most interesting work on the \\'Nature of Limbs.\\' On the\\nordinary view of the independent creation of each being, we can only say\\nthat so it is;--that it has so pleased the Creator to construct each animal\\nand plant.\\n\\nThe explanation is manifest on the theory of the {435} natural selection of\\nsuccessive slight modifications,--each modification being profitable in\\nsome way to the modified form, but often affecting by correlation of growth\\nother parts of the organisation. In changes of this nature, there will be\\nlittle or no tendency to modify the original pattern, or to transpose\\nparts. The bones of a limb might be shortened and widened to any extent,\\nand become gradually enveloped in thick membrane, so as to serve as a fin;\\nor a webbed foot might have all its bones, or certain bones, lengthened to\\nany extent, and the membrane connecting them increased to any extent, so as\\nto serve as a wing: yet in all this great amount of modification there will\\nbe no tendency to alter the framework of bones or the relative connexion of\\nthe several parts. If we suppose that the ancient progenitor, the archetype\\nas it may be called, of all mammals, had its limbs constructed on the\\nexisting general pattern, for whatever purpose they served, we can at once\\nperceive the plain signification of the homologous construction of the\\nlimbs throughout the whole class. So with the mouths of insects, we have\\nonly to suppose that their common progenitor had an upper lip, mandibles,\\nand two pair of maxillГ¦, these parts being perhaps very simple in form; and\\nthen natural selection, acting on some originally created form, will\\naccount for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the mouths\\nof insects. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the general pattern of an\\norgan might become so much obscured as to be finally lost, by the atrophy\\nand ultimately by the complete abortion of certain parts, by the soldering\\ntogether of other parts, and by the doubling or multiplication of\\nothers,--variations which we know to be within the limits of possibility.\\nIn the paddles of the extinct gigantic sea-lizards, and in the mouths of\\ncertain suctorial crustaceans, the {436} general pattern seems to have been\\nthus to a certain extent obscured.\\n\\nThere is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely,\\nthe comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of\\nthe different parts or organs in the same individual. Most physiologists\\nbelieve that the bones of the skull are homologous with--that is correspond\\nin number and in relative connexion with--the elemental parts of a certain\\nnumber of vertebrГ¦. The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the\\nvertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. We see the same\\nlaw in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. It\\nis familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of\\nthe sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate\\nstructure, are intelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed\\nleaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct\\nevidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another;\\nand we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals,\\nand in flowers, that organs, which when mature become extremely different,\\nare at an early stage of growth exactly alike.\\n\\nHow inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! Why\\nshould the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such\\nextraordinary shaped pieces of bone? As Owen has remarked, the benefit\\nderived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition\\nof mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of\\nbirds. Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the\\nwing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different\\npurposes? Why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex {437}\\nmouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or\\nconversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the\\nsepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though\\nfitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same\\npattern?\\n\\nOn the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these\\nquestions. In the vertebrata, we see a series of internal vertebrГ¦ bearing\\ncertain processes and appendages; in the articulata, we see the body\\ndivided into a series of segments, bearing external appendages; and in\\nflowering plants, we see a series of successive spiral whorls of leaves. An\\nindefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common\\ncharacteristic (as Owen has observed) of all low or little-modified forms;\\ntherefore we may readily believe that the unknown progenitor of the\\nvertebrata possessed many vertebrГ¦; the unknown progenitor of the\\narticulata, many segments; and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants,\\nmany spiral whorls of leaves. We have formerly seen that parts many times\\nrepeated are eminently liable to vary in number and structure; consequently\\nit is quite probable that natural selection, during a long-continued course\\nof modification, should have seized on a certain number of the primordially\\nsimilar elements, many times repeated, and have adapted them to the most\\ndiverse purposes. And as the whole amount of modification will have been\\neffected by slight successive steps, we need not wonder at discovering in\\nsuch parts or organs, a certain degree of fundamental resemblance, retained\\nby the strong principle of inheritance.\\n\\nIn the great class of molluscs, though we can homologise the parts of one\\nspecies with those of other and distinct species, we can indicate but few\\nserial homologies; that is, we are seldom enabled to say that one {438}\\npart or organ is homologous with another in the same individual. And we can\\nunderstand this fact; for in molluscs, even in the lowest members of the\\nclass, we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of any one part,\\nas we find in the other great classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\\n\\nNaturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed\\nvertebrГ¦: the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the stamens and pistils\\nof flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it would in these cases probably be\\nmore correct, as Professor Huxley has remarked, to speak of both skull and\\nvertebrГ¦, both jaws and legs, &c.,--as having been metamorphosed, not one\\nfrom the other, but from some common element. Naturalists, however, use\\nsuch language only in a metaphorical sense: they are far from meaning that\\nduring a long course of descent, primordial organs of any kind--vertebrГ¦ in\\nthe one case and legs in the other--have actually been modified into skulls\\nor jaws. Yet so strong is the appearance of a modification of this nature\\nhaving occurred, that naturalists can hardly avoid employing language\\nhaving this plain signification. On my view these terms may be used\\nliterally; and the wonderful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab\\nretaining numerous characters, which they would probably have retained\\nthrough inheritance, if they had really been metamorphosed during a long\\ncourse of descent from true legs, or from some simple appendage, is\\nexplained.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Embryology._--It has already been casually remarked that certain organs in\\nthe individual, which when mature become widely different and serve for\\ndifferent purposes, are in the embryo exactly alike. The embryos, also, of\\ndistinct animals within the same class are often strikingly similar: a\\nbetter proof of this cannot be given, than a {439} circumstance mentioned\\nby Agassiz, namely, that having forgotten to ticket the embryo of some\\nvertebrate animal, he cannot now tell whether it be that of a mammal, bird,\\nor reptile. The vermiform larvГ¦ of moths, flies, beetles, &c., resemble\\neach other much more closely than do the mature insects; but in the case of\\nlarvГ¦, the embryos are active, and have been adapted for special lines of\\nlife. A trace of the law of embryonic resemblance, sometimes lasts till a\\nrather late age: thus birds of the same genus, and of closely allied\\ngenera, often resemble each other in their first and second plumage; as we\\nsee in the spotted feathers in the thrush group. In the cat tribe, most of\\nthe species are striped or spotted in lines; and stripes can be plainly\\ndistinguished in the whelp of the lion. We occasionally though rarely see\\nsomething of this kind in plants: thus the embryonic leaves of the ulex or\\nfurze, and the first leaves of the phyllodineous acaceas, are pinnate or\\ndivided like the ordinary leaves of the leguminosГ¦.\\n\\nThe points of structure, in which the embryos of widely different animals\\nof the same class resemble each other, often have no direct relation to\\ntheir conditions of existence. We cannot, for instance, suppose that in the\\nembryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like course of the arteries\\nnear the branchial slits are related to similar conditions,--in the young\\nmammal which is nourished in the womb of its mother, in the egg of the bird\\nwhich is hatched in a nest, and in the spawn of a frog under water. We have\\nno more reason to believe in such a relation, than we have to believe that\\nthe same bones in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, and fin of a porpoise,\\nare related to similar conditions of life. No one will suppose that the\\nstripes on the whelp of a lion, or the spots on the young blackbird, {440}\\nare of any use to these animals, or are related to the conditions to which\\nthey are exposed.\\n\\nThe case, however, is different when an animal during any part of its\\nembryonic career is active, and has to provide for itself. The period of\\nactivity may come on earlier or later in life; but whenever it comes on,\\nthe adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as perfect\\nand as beautiful as in the adult animal. From such special adaptations, the\\nsimilarity of the larvГ¦ or active embryos of allied animals is sometimes\\nmuch obscured; and cases could be given of the larvГ¦ of two species, or of\\ntwo groups of species, differing quite as much, or even more, from each\\nother than do their adult parents. In most cases, however, the larvГ¦,\\nthough active, still obey, more or less closely, the law of common\\nembryonic resemblance. Cirripedes afford a good instance of this: even the\\nillustrious Cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was, as it certainly\\nis, a crustacean; but a glance at the larva shows this to be the case in an\\nunmistakeable manner. So again the two main divisions of cirripedes, the\\npedunculated and sessile, which differ widely in external appearance, have\\nlarvГ¦ in all their stages barely distinguishable.\\n\\nThe embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation: I\\nuse this expression, though I am aware that it is hardly possible to define\\nclearly what is meant by the organisation being higher or lower. But no one\\nprobably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than the caterpillar. In\\nsome cases, however, the mature animal is generally considered as lower in\\nthe scale than the larva, as with certain parasitic crustaceans. To refer\\nonce again to cirripedes: the larvГ¦ in the first stage have three pairs of\\nlegs, a very simple single eye, and a probosciformed mouth, with which they\\nfeed largely, for they increase much in {441} size. In the second stage,\\nanswering to the chrysalis stage of butterflies, they have six pairs of\\nbeautifully constructed natatory legs, a pair of magnificent compound eyes,\\nand extremely complex antennГ¦; but they have a closed and imperfect mouth,\\nand cannot feed: their function at this stage is, to search by their\\nwell-developed organs of sense, and to reach by their active powers of\\nswimming, a proper place on which to become attached and to undergo their\\nfinal metamorphosis. When this is completed they are fixed for life: their\\nlegs are now converted into prehensile organs; they again obtain a\\nwell-constructed mouth; but they have no antennГ¦, and their two eyes are\\nnow reconverted into a minute, single, and very simple eye-spot. In this\\nlast and complete state, cirripedes may be considered as either more highly\\nor more lowly organised than they were in the larval condition. But in some\\ngenera the larvГ¦ become developed either into hermaphrodites having the\\nordinary structure, or into what I have called complemental males: and in\\nthe latter, the development has assuredly been retrograde; for the male is\\na mere sack, which lives for a short time, and is destitute of mouth,\\nstomach, or other organ of importance, excepting for reproduction.\\n\\nWe are so much accustomed to see differences in structure between the\\nembryo and the adult, and likewise a close similarity in the embryos of\\nwidely different animals within the same class, that we might be led to\\nlook at these facts as necessarily contingent in some manner on growth. But\\nthere is no obvious reason why, for instance, the wing of a bat, or the fin\\nof a porpoise, should not have been sketched out with all the parts in\\nproper proportion, as soon as any structure became visible in the embryo.\\nAnd in some whole groups of animals and in certain members of other groups,\\nthe embryo does not at any period differ widely from the {442} adult: thus\\nOwen has remarked in regard to cuttle-fish, \"there is no metamorphosis; the\\ncephalopodic character is manifested long before the parts of the embryo\\nare completed;\" and again in spiders, \"there is nothing worthy to be called\\na metamorphosis.\" The larvГ¦ of insects, whether adapted to the most diverse\\nand active habits, or quite inactive, being fed by their parents or placed\\nin the midst of proper nutriment, yet nearly all pass through a similar\\nworm-like stage of development; but in some few cases, as in that of Aphis,\\nif we look to the admirable drawings by Professor Huxley of the development\\nof this insect, we see no trace of the vermiform stage.\\n\\nHow, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology,--namely the\\nvery general, but not universal difference in structure between the embryo\\nand the adult;--of parts in the same individual embryo, which ultimately\\nbecome very unlike and serve for diverse purposes, being at this early\\nperiod of growth alike;--of embryos of different species within the same\\nclass, generally, but not universally, resembling each other;--of the\\nstructure of the embryo not being closely related to its conditions of\\nexistence, except when the embryo becomes at any period of life active and\\nhas to provide for itself;--of the embryo apparently having sometimes a\\nhigher organisation than the mature animal, into which it is developed? I\\nbelieve that all these facts can be explained, as follows, on the view of\\ndescent with modification.\\n\\nIt is commonly assumed, perhaps from monstrosities often affecting the\\nembryos at a very early period, that slight variations necessarily appear\\nat an equally early period. But we have little evidence on this\\nhead--indeed the evidence rather points the other way; for it is notorious\\nthat breeders of cattle, horses, and various {443} fancy animals, cannot\\npositively tell, until some time after the animal has been born, what its\\nmerits or form will ultimately turn out. We see this plainly in our own\\nchildren; we cannot always tell whether the child will be tall or short, or\\nwhat its precise features will be. The question is not, at what period of\\nlife any variation has been caused, but at what period it is fully\\ndisplayed. The cause may have acted, and I believe generally has acted,\\neven before the embryo is formed; and the variation may be due to the male\\nand female sexual elements having been affected by the conditions to which\\neither parent, or their ancestors, have been exposed. Nevertheless an\\neffect thus caused at a very early period, even before the formation of the\\nembryo, may appear late in life; as when an hereditary disease, which\\nappears in old age alone, has been communicated to the offspring from the\\nreproductive element of one parent. Or again, as when the horns of\\ncross-bred cattle have been affected by the shape of the horns of either\\nparent. For the welfare of a very young animal, as long as it remains in\\nits mother\\'s womb, or in the egg, or as long as it is nourished and\\nprotected by its parent, it must be quite unimportant whether most of its\\ncharacters are fully acquired a little earlier or later in life. It would\\nnot signify, for instance, to a bird which obtained its food best by having\\na long beak, whether or not it assumed a beak of this particular length, as\\nlong as it was fed by its parents. Hence, I conclude, that it is quite\\npossible, that each of the many successive modifications, by which each\\nspecies has acquired its present structure, may have supervened at a not\\nvery early period of life; and some direct evidence from our domestic\\nanimals supports this view. But in other cases it is quite possible that\\neach successive modification, or {444} most of them, may have appeared at\\nan extremely early period.\\n\\nI have stated in the first chapter, that there is some evidence to render\\nit probable, that at whatever age any variation first appears in the\\nparent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring.\\nCertain variations can only appear at corresponding ages, for instance,\\npeculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago states of the silk-moth;\\nor, again, in the horns of almost full-grown cattle. But further than this,\\nvariations which, for all that we can see, might have appeared earlier or\\nlater in life, tend to appear at a corresponding age in the offspring and\\nparent. I am far from meaning that this is invariably the case; and I could\\ngive a good many cases of variations (taking the word in the largest sense)\\nwhich have supervened at an earlier age in the child than in the parent.\\n\\nThese two principles, if their truth be admitted, will, I believe, explain\\nall the above specified leading facts in embryology. But first let us look\\nat a few analogous cases in domestic varieties. Some authors who have\\nwritten on Dogs, maintain that the greyhound and bulldog, though appearing\\nso different, are really varieties most closely allied, and have probably\\ndescended from the same wild stock; hence I was curious to see how far\\ntheir puppies differed from each other: I was told by breeders that they\\ndiffered just as much as their parents, and this, judging by the eye,\\nseemed almost to be the case; but on actually measuring the old dogs and\\ntheir six-days old puppies, I found that the puppies had not nearly\\nacquired their full amount of proportional difference. So, again, I was\\ntold that the foals of cart and race-horses differed as much as the\\nfull-grown animals; and this surprised me greatly, as I think it probable\\nthat the difference between these two breeds has been wholly {445} caused\\nby selection under domestication; but having had careful measurements made\\nof the dam and of a three-days old colt of a race and heavy cart-horse, I\\nfind that the colts have by no means acquired their full amount of\\nproportional difference.\\n\\nAs the evidence appears to me conclusive, that the several domestic breeds\\nof Pigeon have descended from one wild species, I compared young pigeons of\\nvarious breeds, within twelve hours after being hatched; I carefully\\nmeasured the proportions (but will not here give details) of the beak,\\nwidth of mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length of\\nleg, in the wild stock, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs, dragons,\\ncarriers, and tumblers. Now some of these birds, when mature, differ so\\nextraordinarily in length and form of beak, that they would, I cannot\\ndoubt, be ranked in distinct genera, had they been natural productions. But\\nwhen the nestling birds of these several breeds were placed in a row,\\nthough most of them could be distinguished from each other, yet their\\nproportional differences in the above specified several points were\\nincomparably less than in the full-grown birds. Some characteristic points\\nof difference--for instance, that of the width of mouth--could hardly be\\ndetected in the young. But there was one remarkable exception to this rule,\\nfor the young of the short-faced tumbler differed from the young of the\\nwild rock-pigeon and of the other breeds, in all its proportions, almost\\nexactly as much as in the adult state.\\n\\nThe two principles above given seem to me to explain these facts in regard\\nto the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties. Fanciers select\\ntheir horses, dogs, and pigeons, for breeding, when they are nearly grown\\nup: they are indifferent whether the desired qualities and structures have\\nbeen acquired earlier or {446} later in life, if the full-grown animal\\npossesses them. And the cases just given, more especially that of pigeons,\\nseem to show that the characteristic differences which give value to each\\nbreed, and which have been accumulated by man\\'s selection, have not\\ngenerally first appeared at an early period of life, and have been\\ninherited by the offspring at a corresponding not early period. But the\\ncase of the short-faced tumbler, which when twelve hours old had acquired\\nits proper proportions, proves that this is not the universal rule; for\\nhere the characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier\\nperiod than usual, or, if not so, the differences must have been inherited,\\nnot at the corresponding, but at an earlier age.\\n\\nNow let us apply these facts and the above two principles--which latter,\\nthough not proved true, can be shown to be in some degree probable--to\\nspecies in a state of nature. Let us take a genus of birds, descended on my\\ntheory from some one parent-species, and of which the several new species\\nhave become modified through natural selection in accordance with their\\ndiverse habits. Then, from the many slight successive steps of variation\\nhaving supervened at a rather late age, and having been inherited at a\\ncorresponding age, the young of the new species of our supposed genus will\\nmanifestly tend to resemble each other much more closely than do the\\nadults, just as we have seen in the case of pigeons. We may extend this\\nview to whole families or even classes. The fore-limbs, for instance, which\\nserved as legs in the parent-species, may have become, by a long course of\\nmodification, adapted in one descendant to act as hands, in another as\\npaddles, in another as wings; and on the above two principles--namely of\\neach successive modification supervening at a rather late age, and being\\ninherited at a {447} corresponding late age--the fore-limbs in the embryos\\nof the several descendants of the parent-species will still resemble each\\nother closely, for they will not have been modified. But in each of our new\\nspecies, the embryonic fore-limbs will differ greatly from the fore-limbs\\nin the mature animal; the limbs in the latter having undergone much\\nmodification at a rather late period of life, and having thus been\\nconverted into hands, or paddles, or wings. Whatever influence\\nlong-continued exercise or use on the one hand, and disuse on the other,\\nmay have in modifying an organ, such influence will mainly affect the\\nmature animal, which has come to its full powers of activity and has to\\ngain its own living; and the effects thus produced will be inherited at a\\ncorresponding mature age. Whereas the young will remain unmodified, or be\\nmodified in a lesser degree, by the effects of use and disuse.\\n\\nIn certain cases the successive steps of variation might supervene, from\\ncauses of which we are wholly ignorant, at a very early period of life, or\\neach step might be inherited at an earlier period than that at which it\\nfirst appeared. In either case (as with the short-faced tumbler) the young\\nor embryo would closely resemble the mature parent-form. We have seen that\\nthis is the rule of development in certain whole groups of animals, as with\\ncuttle-fish and spiders, and with a few members of the great class of\\ninsects, as with Aphis. With respect to the final cause of the young in\\nthese cases not undergoing any metamorphosis, or closely resembling their\\nparents from their earliest age, we can see that this would result from the\\ntwo following contingencies: firstly, from the young, during a course of\\nmodification carried on for many generations, having to provide for their\\nown wants at a very early stage {448} of development, and secondly, from\\ntheir following exactly the same habits of life with their parents; for in\\nthis case, it would be indispensable for the existence of the species, that\\nthe child should be modified at a very early age in the same manner with\\nits parents, in accordance with their similar habits. Some further\\nexplanation, however, of the embryo not undergoing any metamorphosis is\\nperhaps requisite. If, on the other hand, it profited the young to follow\\nhabits of life in any degree different from those of their parent, and\\nconsequently to be constructed in a slightly different manner, then, on the\\nprinciple of inheritance at corresponding ages, the active young or larvГ¦\\nmight easily be rendered by natural selection different to any conceivable\\nextent from their parents. Such differences might, also, become correlated\\nwith successive stages of development; so that the larvГ¦, in the first\\nstage, might differ greatly from the larvГ¦ in the second stage, as we have\\nseen to be the case with cirripedes. The adult might become fitted for\\nsites or habits, in which organs of locomotion or of the senses, &c., would\\nbe useless; and in this case the final metamorphosis would be said to be\\nretrograde.\\n\\nAs all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived on\\nthis earth have to be classed together, and as all have been connected by\\nthe finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our collections were nearly\\nperfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical. Descent\\nbeing on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been\\nseeking under the term of the natural system. On this view we can\\nunderstand how it is that, in the eyes of most naturalists, the structure\\nof the embryo is even more important for classification than that of the\\nadult. For the embryo is the animal in its less modified state; {449} and\\nin so far it reveals the structure of its progenitor. In two groups of\\nanimals, however much they may at present differ from each other in\\nstructure and habits, if they pass through the same or similar embryonic\\nstages, we may feel assured that they have both descended from the same or\\nnearly similar parents, and are therefore in that degree closely related.\\nThus, community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent. It\\nwill reveal this community of descent, however much the structure of the\\nadult may have been modified and obscured; we have seen, for instance, that\\ncirripedes can at once be recognised by their larvГ¦ as belonging to the\\ngreat class of crustaceans. As the embryonic state of each species and\\ngroup of species partially shows us the structure of their less modified\\nancient progenitors, we can clearly see why ancient and extinct forms of\\nlife should resemble the embryos of their descendants,--our existing\\nspecies. Agassiz believes this to be a law of nature; but I am bound to\\nconfess that I only hope to see the law hereafter proved true. It can be\\nproved true in those cases alone in which the ancient state, now supposed\\nto be represented in existing embryos, has not been obliterated, either by\\nthe successive variations in a long course of modification having\\nsupervened at a very early age, or by the variations having been inherited\\nat an earlier period than that at which they first appeared. It should also\\nbe borne in mind, that the supposed law of resemblance of ancient forms of\\nlife to the embryonic stages of recent forms, may be true, but yet, owing\\nto the geological record not extending far enough back in time, may remain\\nfor a long period, or for ever, incapable of demonstration.\\n\\nThus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which are second\\nin importance to none in natural history, are explained on the principle of\\nslight {450} modifications not appearing, in the many descendants from some\\none ancient progenitor, at a very early period in the life of each, though\\nperhaps caused at the earliest, and being inherited at a corresponding not\\nearly period. Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus look at\\nthe embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the common parent-form\\nof each great class of animals.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Rudimentary, atrophied, or aborted Organs._--Organs or parts in this\\nstrange condition, bearing the stamp of inutility, are extremely common\\nthroughout nature. For instance, rudimentary mammГ¦ are very general in the\\nmales of mammals: I presume that the \"bastard-wing\" in birds may be safely\\nconsidered as a digit in a rudimentary state: in very many snakes one lobe\\nof the lungs is rudimentary; in other snakes there are rudiments of the\\npelvis and hind limbs. Some of the cases of rudimentary organs are\\nextremely curious; for instance, the presence of teeth in foetal whales,\\nwhich when grown up have not a tooth in their heads; and the presence of\\nteeth, which never cut through the gums, in the upper jaws of our unborn\\ncalves. It has even been stated on good authority that rudiments of teeth\\ncan be detected in the beaks of certain embryonic birds. Nothing can be\\nplainer than that wings are formed for flight, yet in how many insects do\\nwe see wings so reduced in size as to be utterly incapable of flight, and\\nnot rarely lying under wing-cases, firmly soldered together!\\n\\nThe meaning of rudimentary organs is often quite unmistakeable: for\\ninstance there are beetles of the same genus (and even of the same species)\\nresembling each other most closely in all respects, one of which will have\\nfull-sized wings, and another mere rudiments of membrane; and here it is\\nimpossible to doubt, that the {451} rudiments represent wings. Rudimentary\\norgans sometimes retain their potentiality, and are merely not developed:\\nthis seems to be the case with the mammГ¦ of male mammals, for many\\ninstances are on record of these organs having become well developed in\\nfull-grown males, and having secreted milk. So again there are normally\\nfour developed and two rudimentary teats in the udders of the genus Bos,\\nbut in our domestic cows the two sometimes become developed and give milk.\\nIn plants of the same species the petals sometimes occur as mere rudiments,\\nand sometimes in a well-developed state. In plants with separated sexes,\\nthe male flowers often have a rudiment of a pistil; and KГ¶lreuter found\\nthat by crossing such male plants with an hermaphrodite species, the\\nrudiment of the pistil in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size;\\nand this shows that the rudiment and the perfect pistil are essentially\\nalike in nature.\\n\\nAn organ serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterly\\naborted for one, even the more important purpose; and remain perfectly\\nefficient for the other. Thus in plants, the office of the pistil is to\\nallow the pollen-tubes to reach the ovules protected in the ovarium at its\\nbase. The pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style; but in some\\nCompositГ¦, the male florets, which of course cannot be fecundated, have a\\npistil, which is in a rudimentary state, for it is not crowned with a\\nstigma; but the style remains well developed, and is clothed with hairs as\\nin other compositГ¦, for the purpose of brushing the pollen out of the\\nsurrounding anthers. Again, an organ may become rudimentary for its proper\\npurpose, and be used for a distinct object: in certain fish the\\nswim-bladder seems to be nearly rudimentary for its proper function of\\ngiving buoyancy, but has become converted into a {452} nascent breathing\\norgan or lung. Other similar instances could be given.\\n\\nOrgans, however little developed, if of use, should not be called\\nrudimentary; they cannot properly be said to be in an atrophied condition;\\nthey may be called nascent, and may hereafter be developed to any extent by\\nnatural selection. Rudimentary organs, on the other hand, are essentially\\nuseless, as teeth which never cut through the gums; in a still less\\ndeveloped condition, they would be of still less use. They cannot,\\ntherefore, under their present condition, have been formed by natural\\nselection, which acts solely by the preservation of useful modifications;\\nthey have been retained, as we shall see, by inheritance, and relate to a\\nformer condition of their possessor. It is difficult to know what are\\nnascent organs; looking to the future, we cannot of course tell how any\\npart will be developed, and whether it is now nascent; looking to the past,\\ncreatures with an organ in a nascent condition will generally have been\\nsupplanted and exterminated by their successors with the organ in a more\\nperfect and developed condition. The wing of the penguin is of high\\nservice, and acts as a fin; it may, therefore, represent the nascent state\\nof the wings of birds; not that I believe this to be the case, it is more\\nprobably a reduced organ, modified for a new function: the wing of the\\nApteryx is useless, and is truly rudimentary. The mammary glands of the\\nOrnithorhynchus may, perhaps, be considered, in comparison with the udder\\nof a cow, as in a nascent state. The ovigerous frena of certain cirripedes,\\nwhich are only slightly developed and which have ceased to give attachment\\nto the ova, are nascent branchiГ¦.\\n\\nRudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very liable\\nto vary in degree of development {453} and in other respects. Moreover, in\\nclosely allied species, the degree to which the same organ has been\\nrendered rudimentary occasionally differs much. This latter fact is well\\nexemplified in the state of the wings of the female moths in certain\\ngroups. Rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted; and this implies, that\\nwe find in an animal or plant no trace of an organ, which analogy would\\nlead us to expect to find, and which is occasionally found in monstrous\\nindividuals of the species. Thus in the snapdragon (antirrhinum) we\\ngenerally do not find a rudiment of a fifth stamen; but this may sometimes\\nbe seen. In tracing the homologies of the same part in different members of\\na class, nothing is more common, or more necessary, than the use and\\ndiscovery of rudiments. This is well shown in the drawings given by Owen of\\nthe bones of the leg of the horse, ox, and rhinoceros.\\n\\nIt is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth in the upper\\njaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in the embryo, but\\nafterwards wholly disappear. It is also, I believe, a universal rule, that\\na rudimentary part or organ is of greater size relatively to the adjoining\\nparts in the embryo, than in the adult; so that the organ at this early age\\nis less rudimentary, or even cannot be said to be in any degree\\nrudimentary. Hence, also, a rudimentary organ in the adult is often said to\\nhave retained its embryonic condition.\\n\\nI have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs. In\\nreflecting on them, every one must be struck with astonishment: for the\\nsame reasoning power which tells us plainly that most parts and organs are\\nexquisitely adapted for certain purposes, tells us with equal plainness\\nthat these rudimentary or atrophied organs, are imperfect and useless. In\\nworks {454} on natural history rudimentary organs are generally said to\\nhave been created \"for the sake of symmetry,\" or in order \"to complete the\\nscheme of nature;\" but this seems to me no explanation, merely a\\nre-statement of the fact. Would it be thought sufficient to say that\\nbecause planets revolve in elliptic courses round the sun, satellites\\nfollow the same course round the planets, for the sake of symmetry, and to\\ncomplete the scheme of nature? An eminent physiologist accounts for the\\npresence of rudimentary organs, by supposing that they serve to excrete\\nmatter in excess, or injurious to the system; but can we suppose that the\\nminute papilla, which often represents the pistil in male flowers, and\\nwhich is formed merely of cellular tissue, can thus act? Can we suppose\\nthat the formation of rudimentary teeth, which are subsequently absorbed,\\ncan be of any service to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by the\\nexcretion of precious phosphate of lime? When a man\\'s fingers have been\\namputated, imperfect nails sometimes appear on the stumps: I could as soon\\nbelieve that these vestiges of nails have appeared, not from unknown laws\\nof growth, but in order to excrete horny matter, as that the rudimentary\\nnails on the fin of the manatee were formed for this purpose.\\n\\nOn my view of descent with modification, the origin of rudimentary organs\\nis simple. We have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our domestic\\nproductions,--as the stump of a tail in tailless breeds,--the vestige of an\\near in earless breeds,--the reappearance of minute dangling horns in\\nhornless breeds of cattle, more especially, according to Youatt, in young\\nanimals,--and the state of the whole flower in the cauliflower. We often\\nsee rudiments of various parts in monsters. But I doubt whether any of\\nthese cases throw light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of\\nnature, {455} further than by showing that rudiments can be produced; for I\\ndoubt whether species under nature ever undergo abrupt changes. I believe\\nthat disuse has been the main agency; that it has led in successive\\ngenerations to the gradual reduction of various organs, until they have\\nbecome rudimentary,--as in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark\\ncaverns, and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands, which have\\nseldom been forced to take flight, and have ultimately lost the power of\\nflying. Again, an organ useful under certain conditions, might become\\ninjurious under others, as with the wings of beetles living on small and\\nexposed islands; and in this case natural selection would continue slowly\\nto reduce the organ, until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary.\\n\\nAny change in function, which can be effected by insensibly small steps, is\\nwithin the power of natural selection; so that an organ rendered, during\\nchanged habits of life, useless or injurious for one purpose, might be\\nmodified and used for another purpose. Or an organ might be retained for\\none alone of its former functions. An organ, when rendered useless, may\\nwell be variable, for its variations cannot be checked by natural\\nselection. At whatever period of life disuse or selection reduces an organ,\\nand this will generally be when the being has come to maturity and to its\\nfull powers of action, the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages\\nwill reproduce the organ in its reduced state at the same age, and\\nconsequently will seldom affect or reduce it in the embryo. Thus we can\\nunderstand the greater relative size of rudimentary organs in the embryo,\\nand their lesser relative size in the adult. But if each step of the\\nprocess of reduction were to be inherited, not at the corresponding age,\\nbut at an extremely early period of life (as we have good {456} reason to\\nbelieve to be possible), the rudimentary part would tend to be wholly lost,\\nand we should have a case of complete abortion. The principle, also, of\\neconomy, explained in a former chapter, by which the materials forming any\\npart or structure, if not useful to the possessor, will be saved as far as\\nis possible, will probably often come into play; and this will tend to\\ncause the entire obliteration of a rudimentary organ.\\n\\nAs the presence of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendency in every\\npart of the organisation, which has long existed, to be inherited--we can\\nunderstand, on the genealogical view of classification, how it is that\\nsystematists have found rudimentary parts as useful as, or even sometimes\\nmore useful than, parts of high physiological importance. Rudimentary\\norgans may be compared with the letters in a word, still retained in the\\nspelling, but become useless in the pronunciation, but which serve as a\\nclue in seeking for its derivation. On the view of descent with\\nmodification, we may conclude that the existence of organs in a\\nrudimentary, imperfect, and useless condition, or quite aborted, far from\\npresenting a strange difficulty, as they assuredly do on the ordinary\\ndoctrine of creation, might even have been anticipated, and can be\\naccounted for by the laws of inheritance.\\n\\n\\n\\n_Summary._--In this chapter I have attempted to show, that the\\nsubordination of group to group in all organisms throughout all time; that\\nthe nature of the relationship, by which all living and extinct beings are\\nunited by complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one\\ngrand system; the rules followed and the difficulties encountered by\\nnaturalists in their classifications; the value set upon characters, if\\nconstant and prevalent, whether of high vital importance, or of the most\\ntrifling {457} importance, or, as in rudimentary organs, of no importance;\\nthe wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive characters, and\\ncharacters of true affinity; and other such rules;--all naturally follow on\\nthe view of the common parentage of those forms which are considered by\\nnaturalists as allied, together with their modification through natural\\nselection, with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of\\ncharacter. In considering this view of classification, it should be borne\\nin mind that the element of descent has been universally used in ranking\\ntogether the sexes, ages, and acknowledged varieties of the same species,\\nhowever different they may be in structure. If we extend the use of this\\nelement of descent,--the only certainly known cause of similarity in\\norganic beings,--we shall understand what is meant by the natural system:\\nit is genealogical in its attempted arrangement, with the grades of\\nacquired difference marked by the terms varieties, species, genera,\\nfamilies, orders, and classes.\\n\\nOn this same view of descent with modification, all the great facts in\\nMorphology become intelligible,--whether we look to the same pattern\\ndisplayed in the homologous organs, to whatever purpose applied, of the\\ndifferent species of a class; or to the homologous parts constructed on the\\nsame pattern in each individual animal and plant.\\n\\nOn the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily or\\ngenerally supervening at a very early period of life, and being inherited\\nat a corresponding period, we can understand the great leading facts in\\nEmbryology; namely, the resemblance in an individual embryo of the\\nhomologous parts, which when matured will become widely different from each\\nother in structure and function; and the resemblance in different species\\nof a class of the homologous parts or {458} organs, though fitted in the\\nadult members for purposes as different as possible. LarvГ¦ are active\\nembryos, which have become specially modified in relation to their habits\\nof life, through the principle of modifications being inherited at\\ncorresponding ages. On this same principle--and bearing in mind, that when\\norgans are reduced in size, either from disuse or selection, it will\\ngenerally be at that period of life when the being has to provide for its\\nown wants, and bearing in mind how strong is the principle of\\ninheritance--the occurrence of rudimentary organs and their final abortion,\\npresent to us no inexplicable difficulties; on the contrary, their presence\\nmight have been even anticipated. The importance of embryological\\ncharacters and of rudimentary organs in classification is intelligible, on\\nthe view that an arrangement is only so far natural as it is genealogical.\\n\\nFinally, the several classes of facts which have been considered in this\\nchapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the innumerable species,\\ngenera, and families of organic beings, with which this world is peopled,\\nhave all descended, each within its own class or group, from common\\nparents, and have all been modified in the course of descent, that I should\\nwithout hesitation adopt this view, even if it were unsupported by other\\nfacts or arguments.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{459}\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV.\\n\\nRECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION.\\n\\n    Recapitulation of the difficulties on the theory of Natural\\n    Selection--Recapitulation of the general and special circumstances in\\n    its favour--Causes of the general belief in the immutability of\\n    species--How far the theory of natural selection may be\\n    extended--Effects of its adoption on the study of Natural\\n    history--Concluding remarks.\\n\\nAs this whole volume is one long argument, it may be convenient to the\\nreader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated.\\n\\nThat many and serious objections may be advanced against the theory of\\ndescent with modification through natural selection, I do not deny. I have\\nendeavoured to give to them their full force. Nothing at first can appear\\nmore difficult to believe than that the more complex organs and instincts\\nshould have been perfected, not by means superior to, though analogous\\nwith, human reason, but by the accumulation of innumerable slight\\nvariations, each good for the individual possessor. Nevertheless, this\\ndifficulty, though appearing to our imagination insuperably great, cannot\\nbe considered real if we admit the following propositions, namely,--that\\ngradations in the perfection of any organ or instinct which we may\\nconsider, either do now exist or could have existed, each good of its\\nkind,--that all organs and instincts are, in ever so slight a degree,\\nvariable,--and, lastly, that there is a struggle for existence leading to\\nthe preservation of each profitable deviation of structure or instinct. The\\ntruth of these propositions cannot, I think, be disputed. {460}\\n\\nIt is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conjecture by what gradations\\nmany structures have been perfected, more especially amongst broken and\\nfailing groups of organic beings; but we see so many strange gradations in\\nnature, that we ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or\\ninstinct, or any whole being, could not have arrived at its present state\\nby many graduated steps. There are, it must be admitted, cases of special\\ndifficulty on the theory of natural selection; and one of the most curious\\nof these is the existence of two or three defined castes of workers or\\nsterile females in the same community of ants; but I have attempted to show\\nhow this difficulty can be mastered.\\n\\nWith respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first\\ncrossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal\\nfertility of varieties when crossed, I must refer the reader to the\\nrecapitulation of the facts given at the end of the eighth chapter, which\\nseem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special\\nendowment than is the incapacity of two trees to be grafted together; but\\nthat it is incidental on constitutional differences in the reproductive\\nsystems of the intercrossed species. We see the truth of this conclusion in\\nthe vast difference in the result, when the same two species are crossed\\nreciprocally; that is, when one species is first used as the father and\\nthen as the mother.\\n\\nThe fertility of varieties when intercrossed and of their mongrel offspring\\ncannot be considered as universal; nor is their very general fertility\\nsurprising when we remember that it is not likely that either their\\nconstitutions or their reproductive systems should have been profoundly\\nmodified. Moreover, most of the varieties which have been experimentised on\\nhave been {461} produced under domestication; and as domestication (I do\\nnot mean mere confinement) apparently tends to eliminate sterility, we\\nought not to expect it also to produce sterility.\\n\\nThe sterility of hybrids is a very different case from that of first\\ncrosses, for their reproductive organs are more or less functionally\\nimpotent; whereas in first crosses the organs on both sides are in a\\nperfect condition. As we continually see that organisms of all kinds are\\nrendered in some degree sterile from their constitutions having been\\ndisturbed by slightly different and new conditions of life, we need not\\nfeel surprise at hybrids being in some degree sterile, for their\\nconstitutions can hardly fail to have been disturbed from being compounded\\nof two distinct organisations. This parallelism is supported by another\\nparallel, but directly opposite, class of facts; namely, that the vigour\\nand fertility of all organic beings are increased by slight changes in\\ntheir conditions of life, and that the offspring of slightly modified forms\\nor varieties acquire from being crossed increased vigour and fertility. So\\nthat, on the one hand, considerable changes in the conditions of life and\\ncrosses between greatly modified forms, lessen fertility; and on the other\\nhand, lesser changes in the conditions of life and crosses between less\\nmodified forms, increase fertility.\\n\\nTurning to geographical distribution, the difficulties encountered on the\\ntheory of descent with modification are grave enough. All the individuals\\nof the same species, and all the species of the same genus, or even higher\\ngroup, must have descended from common parents; and therefore, in however\\ndistant and isolated parts of the world they are now found, they must in\\nthe course of successive generations have passed from some one part to the\\nothers. We are often wholly unable {462} even to conjecture how this could\\nhave been effected. Yet, as we have reason to believe that some species\\nhave retained the same specific form for very long periods, enormously long\\nas measured by years, too much stress ought not to be laid on the\\noccasional wide diffusion of the same species; for during very long periods\\nof time there will always have been a good chance for wide migration by\\nmany means. A broken or interrupted range may often be accounted for by the\\nextinction of the species in the intermediate regions. It cannot be denied\\nthat we are as yet very ignorant of the full extent of the various climatal\\nand geographical changes which have affected the earth during modern\\nperiods; and such changes will obviously have greatly facilitated\\nmigration. As an example, I have attempted to show how potent has been the\\ninfluence of the Glacial period on the distribution both of the same and of\\nrepresentative species throughout the world. We are as yet profoundly\\nignorant of the many occasional means of transport. With respect to\\ndistinct species of the same genus inhabiting very distant and isolated\\nregions, as the process of modification has necessarily been slow, all the\\nmeans of migration will have been possible during a very long period; and\\nconsequently the difficulty of the wide diffusion of species of the same\\ngenus is in some degree lessened.\\n\\nAs on the theory of natural selection an interminable number of\\nintermediate forms must have existed, linking together all the species in\\neach group by gradations as fine as our present varieties, it may be asked,\\nWhy do we not see these linking forms all around us? Why are not all\\norganic beings blended together in an inextricable chaos? With respect to\\nexisting forms, we should remember that we have no right to expect\\n(excepting in rare cases) to discover _directly_ connecting {463} links\\nbetween them, but only between each and some extinct and supplanted form.\\nEven on a wide area, which has during a long period remained continuous,\\nand of which the climate and other conditions of life change insensibly in\\ngoing from a district occupied by one species into another district\\noccupied by a closely allied species, we have no just right to expect often\\nto find intermediate varieties in the intermediate zone. For we have reason\\nto believe that only a few species are undergoing change at any one period;\\nand all changes are slowly effected. I have also shown that the\\nintermediate varieties which will at first probably exist in the\\nintermediate zones, will be liable to be supplanted by the allied forms on\\neither hand; and the latter, from existing in greater numbers, will\\ngenerally be modified and improved at a quicker rate than the intermediate\\nvarieties, which exist in lesser numbers; so that the intermediate\\nvarieties will, in the long run, be supplanted and exterminated.\\n\\nOn this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting links,\\nbetween the living and extinct inhabitants of the world, and at each\\nsuccessive period between the extinct and still older species, why is not\\nevery geological formation charged with such links? Why does not every\\ncollection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and\\nmutation of the forms of life? We meet with no such evidence, and this is\\nthe most obvious and forcible of the many objections which may be urged\\nagainst my theory. Why, again, do whole groups of allied species appear,\\nthough certainly they often falsely appear, to have come in suddenly on the\\nseveral geological stages? Why do we not find great piles of strata beneath\\nthe Silurian system, stored with the remains of the progenitors of the\\nSilurian groups of fossils? For certainly on my theory such {464} strata\\nmust somewhere have been deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown\\nepochs in the world\\'s history.\\n\\nI can answer these questions and grave objections only on the supposition\\nthat the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists\\nbelieve. It cannot be objected that there has not been time sufficient for\\nany amount of organic change; for the lapse of time has been so great as to\\nbe utterly inappreciable by the human intellect. The number of specimens in\\nall our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with the countless\\ngenerations of countless species which certainly have existed. We should\\nnot be able to recognise a species as the parent of any one or more species\\nif we were to examine them ever so closely, unless we likewise possessed\\nmany of the intermediate links between their past or parent and present\\nstates; and these many links we could hardly ever expect to discover, owing\\nto the imperfection of the geological record. Numerous existing doubtful\\nforms could be named which are probably varieties; but who will pretend\\nthat in future ages so many fossil links will be discovered, that\\nnaturalists will be able to decide, on the common view, whether or not\\nthese doubtful forms are varieties? As long as most of the links between\\nany two species are unknown, if any one link or intermediate variety be\\ndiscovered, it will simply be classed as another and distinct species. Only\\na small portion of the world has been geologically explored. Only organic\\nbeings of certain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition, at least\\nin any great number. Widely ranging species vary most, and varieties are\\noften at first local,--both causes rendering the discovery of intermediate\\nlinks less likely. Local varieties will not spread into other and distant\\nregions until they are considerably modified and {465} improved; and when\\nthey do spread, if discovered in a geological formation, they will appear\\nas if suddenly created there, and will be simply classed as new species.\\nMost formations have been intermittent in their accumulation; and their\\nduration, I am inclined to believe, has been shorter than the average\\nduration of specific forms. Successive formations are separated from each\\nother by enormous blank intervals of time; for fossiliferous formations,\\nthick enough to resist future degradation, can be accumulated only where\\nmuch sediment is deposited on the subsiding bed of the sea. During the\\nalternate periods of elevation and of stationary level the record will be\\nblank. During these latter periods there will probably be more variability\\nin the forms of life; during periods of subsidence, more extinction.\\n\\nWith respect to the absence of fossiliferous formations beneath the lowest\\nSilurian strata, I can only recur to the hypothesis given in the ninth\\nchapter. That the geological record is imperfect all will admit; but that\\nit is imperfect to the degree which I require, few will be inclined to\\nadmit. If we look to long enough intervals of time, geology plainly\\ndeclares that all species have changed; and they have changed in the manner\\nwhich my theory requires, for they have changed slowly and in a graduated\\nmanner. We clearly see this in the fossil remains from consecutive\\nformations invariably being much more closely related to each other, than\\nare the fossils from formations distant from each other in time.\\n\\nSuch is the sum of the several chief objections and difficulties which may\\njustly be urged against my theory; and I have now briefly recapitulated the\\nanswers and explanations which can be given to them. I have felt these\\ndifficulties far too heavily during many years to {466} doubt their weight.\\nBut it deserves especial notice that the more important objections relate\\nto questions on which we are confessedly ignorant; nor do we know how\\nignorant we are. We do not know all the possible transitional gradations\\nbetween the simplest and the most perfect organs; it cannot be pretended\\nthat we know all the varied means of Distribution during the long lapse of\\nyears, or that we know how imperfect the Geological Record is. Grave as\\nthese several difficulties are, in my judgment they do not overthrow the\\ntheory of descent from a few created forms with subsequent modification.\\n\\n\\n\\nNow let us turn to the other side of the argument. Under domestication we\\nsee much variability. This seems to be mainly due to the reproductive\\nsystem being eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life; so\\nthat this system, when not rendered impotent, fails to reproduce offspring\\nexactly like the parent-form. Variability is governed by many complex\\nlaws,--by correlation of growth, by use and disuse, and by the direct\\naction of the physical conditions of life. There is much difficulty in\\nascertaining how much modification our domestic productions have undergone;\\nbut we may safely infer that the amount has been large, and that\\nmodifications can be inherited for long periods. As long as the conditions\\nof life remain the same, we have reason to believe that a modification,\\nwhich has already been inherited for many generations, may continue to be\\ninherited for an almost infinite number of generations. On the other hand\\nwe have evidence that variability, when it has once come into play, does\\nnot wholly cease; for new varieties are still occasionally produced by our\\nmost anciently domesticated productions. {467}\\n\\nMan does not actually produce variability; he only unintentionally exposes\\norganic beings to new conditions of life, and then nature acts on the\\norganisation, and causes variability. But man can and does select the\\nvariations given to him by nature, and thus accumulate them in any desired\\nmanner. He thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or pleasure.\\nHe may do this methodically, or he may do it unconsciously by preserving\\nthe individuals most useful to him at the time, without any thought of\\naltering the breed. It is certain that he can largely influence the\\ncharacter of a breed by selecting, in each successive generation,\\nindividual differences so slight as to be quite inappreciable by an\\nuneducated eye. This process of selection has been the great agency in the\\nproduction of the most distinct and useful domestic breeds. That many of\\nthe breeds produced by man have to a large extent the character of natural\\nspecies, is shown by the inextricable doubts whether very many of them are\\nvarieties or aboriginal species.\\n\\nThere is no obvious reason why the principles which have acted so\\nefficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature. In the\\npreservation of favoured individuals and races, during the\\nconstantly-recurrent Struggle for Existence, we see the most powerful and\\never-acting means of selection. The struggle for existence inevitably\\nfollows from the high geometrical ratio of increase which is common to all\\norganic beings. This high rate of increase is proved by calculation,--by\\nthe rapid increase of many animals and plants during a succession of\\npeculiar seasons, or when naturalised in a new country. More individuals\\nare born than can possibly survive. A grain in the balance will determine\\nwhich individual shall live and which shall die,--which variety or species\\nshall increase in number, and which {468} shall decrease, or finally become\\nextinct. As the individuals of the same species come in all respects into\\nthe closest competition with each other, the struggle will generally be\\nmost severe between them; it will be almost equally severe between the\\nvarieties of the same species, and next in severity between the species of\\nthe same genus. But the struggle will often be very severe between beings\\nmost remote in the scale of nature. The slightest advantage in one being,\\nat any age or during any season, over those with which it comes into\\ncompetition, or better adaptation in however slight a degree to the\\nsurrounding physical conditions, will turn the balance.\\n\\nWith animals having separated sexes there will in most cases be a struggle\\nbetween the males for possession of the females. The most vigorous\\nindividuals, or those which have most successfully struggled with their\\nconditions of life, will generally leave most progeny. But success will\\noften depend on having special weapons or means of defence, or on the\\ncharms of the males; and the slightest advantage will lead to victory.\\n\\nAs geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical\\nchanges, we might have expected that organic beings would have varied under\\nnature, in the same way as they generally have varied under the changed\\nconditions of domestication. And if there be any variability under nature,\\nit would be an unaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into\\nplay. It has often been asserted, but the assertion is quite incapable of\\nproof, that the amount of variation under nature is a strictly limited\\nquantity. Man, though acting on external characters alone and often\\ncapriciously, can produce within a short period a great result by adding up\\nmere individual differences in his domestic productions; and every one\\nadmits that there are at least individual differences in species under\\n{469} nature. But, besides such differences, all naturalists have admitted\\nthe existence of varieties, which they think sufficiently distinct to be\\nworthy of record in systematic works. No one can draw any clear distinction\\nbetween individual differences and slight varieties; or between more\\nplainly marked varieties and sub-species, and species. Let it be observed\\nhow naturalists differ in the rank which they assign to the many\\nrepresentative forms in Europe and North America.\\n\\nIf then we have under nature variability and a powerful agent always ready\\nto act and select, why should we doubt that variations in any way useful to\\nbeings, under their excessively complex relations of life, would be\\npreserved, accumulated, and inherited? Why, if man can by patience select\\nvariations most useful to himself, should nature fail in selecting\\nvariations useful, under changing conditions of life, to her living\\nproducts? What limit can be put to this power, acting during long ages and\\nrigidly scrutinising the whole constitution, structure, and habits of each\\ncreature,--favouring the good and rejecting the bad? I can see no limit to\\nthis power, in slowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most\\ncomplex relations of life. The theory of natural selection, even if we\\nlooked no further than this, seems to me to be in itself probable. I have\\nalready recapitulated, as fairly as I could, the opposed difficulties and\\nobjections: now let us turn to the special facts and arguments in favour of\\nthe theory.\\n\\nOn the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties,\\nand that each species first existed as a variety, we can see why it is that\\nno line of demarcation can be drawn between species, commonly supposed to\\nhave been produced by special acts of creation, and varieties which are\\nacknowledged to have been produced by secondary laws. On this same {470}\\nview we can understand how it is that in each region where many species of\\na genus have been produced, and where they now flourish, these same species\\nshould present many varieties; for where the manufactory of species has\\nbeen active, we might expect, as a general rule, to find it still in\\naction; and this is the case if varieties be incipient species. Moreover,\\nthe species of the larger genera, which afford the greater number of\\nvarieties or incipient species, retain to a certain degree the character of\\nvarieties; for they differ from each other by a less amount of difference\\nthan do the species of smaller genera. The closely allied species also of\\nthe larger genera apparently have restricted ranges, and in their\\naffinities they are clustered in little groups round other species--in\\nwhich respects they resemble varieties. These are strange relations on the\\nview of each species having been independently created, but are\\nintelligible if all species first existed as varieties.\\n\\nAs each species tends by its geometrical ratio of reproduction to increase\\ninordinately in number; and as the modified descendants of each species\\nwill be enabled to increase by so much the more as they become diversified\\nin habits and structure, so as to be enabled to seize on many and widely\\ndifferent places in the economy of nature, there will be a constant\\ntendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent offspring of\\nany one species. Hence during a long-continued course of modification, the\\nslight differences, characteristic of varieties of the same species, tend\\nto be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of species of\\nthe same genus. New and improved varieties will inevitably supplant and\\nexterminate the older, less improved and intermediate varieties; and thus\\nspecies are rendered to a large extent defined and distinct objects.\\nDominant species belonging to the {471} larger groups tend to give birth to\\nnew and dominant forms; so that each large group tends to become still\\nlarger, and at the same time more divergent in character. But as all groups\\ncannot thus succeed in increasing in size, for the world would not hold\\nthem, the more dominant groups beat the less dominant. This tendency in the\\nlarge groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character,\\ntogether with the almost inevitable contingency of much extinction,\\nexplains the arrangement of all the forms of life, in groups subordinate to\\ngroups, all within a few great classes, which we now see everywhere around\\nus, and which has prevailed throughout all time. This grand fact of the\\ngrouping of all organic beings seems to me utterly inexplicable on the\\ntheory of creation.\\n\\nAs natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive,\\nfavourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification; it\\ncan act only by very short and slow steps. Hence the canon of \"Natura non\\nfacit saltum,\" which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to make\\ntruer, is on this theory simply intelligible. We can plainly see why nature\\nis prodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation. But why this should\\nbe a law of nature if each species has been independently created, no man\\ncan explain.\\n\\nMany other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory. How\\nstrange it is that a bird, under the form of woodpecker, should have been\\ncreated to prey on insects on the ground; that upland geese, which never or\\nrarely swim, should have been created with webbed feet; that a thrush\\nshould have been created to dive and feed on sub-aquatic insects; and that\\na petrel should have been created with habits and structure fitting it for\\nthe life of an auk or grebe! and so on in endless other cases. But on the\\nview of each {472} species constantly trying to increase in number, with\\nnatural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying descendants of\\neach to any unoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature, these facts cease\\nto be strange, or perhaps might even have been anticipated.\\n\\nAs natural selection acts by competition, it adapts the inhabitants of each\\ncountry only in relation to the degree of perfection of their associates;\\nso that we need feel no surprise at the inhabitants of any one country,\\nalthough on the ordinary view supposed to have been specially created and\\nadapted for that country, being beaten and supplanted by the naturalised\\nproductions from another land. Nor ought we to marvel if all the\\ncontrivances in nature be not, as far as we can judge, absolutely perfect;\\nand if some of them be abhorrent to our ideas of fitness. We need not\\nmarvel at the sting of the bee causing the bee\\'s own death; at drones being\\nproduced in such vast numbers for one single act, with the great majority\\nslaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the astonishing waste of pollen by\\nour fir-trees; at the instinctive hatred of the queen bee for her own\\nfertile daughters; at ichneumonidГ¦ feeding within the live bodies of\\ncaterpillars; and at other such cases. The wonder indeed is, on the theory\\nof natural selection, that more cases of the want of absolute perfection\\nhave not been observed.\\n\\nThe complex and little known laws governing variation are the same, as far\\nas we can see, with the laws which have governed the production of\\nso-called specific forms. In both cases physical conditions seem to have\\nproduced but little direct effect; yet when varieties enter any zone, they\\noccasionally assume some of the characters of the species proper to that\\nzone. In both varieties and species, use and disuse seem to have produced\\nsome effect; for it is difficult to resist this {473} conclusion when we\\nlook, for instance, at the logger-headed duck, which has wings incapable of\\nflight, in nearly the same condition as in the domestic duck; or when we\\nlook at the burrowing tucutucu, which is occasionally blind, and then at\\ncertain moles, which are habitually blind and have their eyes covered with\\nskin; or when we look at the blind animals inhabiting the dark caves of\\nAmerica and Europe. In both varieties and species correlation of growth\\nseems to have played a most important part, so that when one part has been\\nmodified other parts are necessarily modified. In both varieties and\\nspecies reversions to long-lost characters occur. How inexplicable on the\\ntheory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulder\\nand legs of the several species of the horse-genus and in their hybrids!\\nHow simply is this fact explained if we believe that these species have\\ndescended from a striped progenitor, in the same manner as the several\\ndomestic breeds of pigeon have descended from the blue and barred\\nrock-pigeon!\\n\\nOn the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, why\\nshould the specific characters, or those by which the species of the same\\ngenus differ from each other, be more variable than the generic characters\\nin which they all agree? Why, for instance, should the colour of a flower\\nbe more likely to vary in any one species of a genus, if the other species,\\nsupposed to have been created independently, have differently coloured\\nflowers, than if all the species of the genus have the same coloured\\nflowers? If species are only well-marked varieties, of which the characters\\nhave become in a high degree permanent, we can understand this fact; for\\nthey have already varied since they branched off from a common progenitor\\nin certain characters, by which they have come to be specifically distinct\\nfrom each other; {474} and therefore these same characters would be more\\nlikely still to be variable than the generic characters which have been\\ninherited without change for an enormous period. It is inexplicable on the\\ntheory of creation why a part developed in a very unusual manner in any one\\nspecies of a genus, and therefore, as we may naturally infer, of great\\nimportance to the species, should be eminently liable to variation; but, on\\nmy view, this part has undergone, since the several species branched off\\nfrom a common progenitor, an unusual amount of variability and\\nmodification, and therefore we might expect this part generally to be still\\nvariable. But a part may be developed in the most unusual manner, like the\\nwing of a bat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if\\nthe part be common to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been\\ninherited for a very long period; for in this case it will have been\\nrendered constant by long-continued natural selection.\\n\\nGlancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they offer no greater\\ndifficulty than does corporeal structure on the theory of the natural\\nselection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. We can thus\\nunderstand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing different\\nanimals of the same class with their several instincts. I have attempted to\\nshow how much light the principle of gradation throws on the admirable\\narchitectural powers of the hive-bee. Habit no doubt sometimes comes into\\nplay in modifying instincts; but it certainly is not indispensable, as we\\nsee, in the case of neuter insects, which leave no progeny to inherit the\\neffects of long-continued habit. On the view of all the species of the same\\ngenus having descended from a common parent, and having inherited much in\\ncommon, we can understand how it is that allied species, when placed under\\nconsiderably different conditions of life, {475} yet should follow nearly\\nthe same instincts; why the thrush of South America, for instance, lines\\nher nest with mud like our British species. On the view of instincts having\\nbeen slowly acquired through natural selection we need not marvel at some\\ninstincts being apparently not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many\\ninstincts causing other animals to suffer.\\n\\nIf species be only well-marked and permanent varieties, we can at once see\\nwhy their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws in their\\ndegrees and kinds of resemblance to their parents,--in being absorbed into\\neach other by successive crosses, and in other such points,--as do the\\ncrossed offspring of acknowledged varieties. On the other hand, these would\\nbe strange facts if species have been independently created, and varieties\\nhave been produced by secondary laws.\\n\\nIf we admit that the geological record is imperfect in an extreme degree,\\nthen such facts as the record gives, support the theory of descent with\\nmodification. New species have come on the stage slowly and at successive\\nintervals; and the amount of change, after equal intervals of time, is\\nwidely different in different groups. The extinction of species and of\\nwhole groups of species, which has played so conspicuous a part in the\\nhistory of the organic world, almost inevitably follows on the principle of\\nnatural selection; for old forms will be supplanted by new and improved\\nforms. Neither single species nor groups of species reappear when the chain\\nof ordinary generation has once been broken. The gradual diffusion of\\ndominant forms, with the slow modification of their descendants, causes the\\nforms of life, after long intervals of time, to appear as if they had\\nchanged simultaneously throughout the world. The fact of the fossil remains\\nof each formation being in some degree intermediate in character between\\nthe {476} fossils in the formations above and below, is simply explained by\\ntheir intermediate position in the chain of descent. The grand fact that\\nall extinct organic beings belong to the same system with recent beings,\\nfalling either into the same or into intermediate groups, follows from the\\nliving and the extinct being the offspring of common parents. As the groups\\nwhich have descended from an ancient progenitor have generally diverged in\\ncharacter, the progenitor with its early descendants will often be\\nintermediate in character in comparison with its later descendants; and\\nthus we can see why the more ancient a fossil is, the oftener it stands in\\nsome degree intermediate between existing and allied groups. Recent forms\\nare generally looked at as being, in some vague sense, higher than ancient\\nand extinct forms; and they are in so far higher as the later and more\\nimproved forms have conquered the older and less improved organic beings in\\nthe struggle for life. Lastly, the law of the long endurance of allied\\nforms on the same continent,--of marsupials in Australia, of edentata in\\nAmerica, and other such cases,--is intelligible, for within a confined\\ncountry, the recent and the extinct will naturally be allied by descent.\\n\\nLooking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been\\nduring the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world to\\nanother, owing to former climatal and geographical changes and to the many\\noccasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can understand, on the\\ntheory of descent with modification, most of the great leading facts in\\nDistribution. We can see why there should be so striking a parallelism in\\nthe distribution of organic beings throughout space, and in their\\ngeological succession throughout time; for in both cases the beings have\\nbeen connected by the bond of ordinary generation, and the means of {477}\\nmodification have been the same. We see the full meaning of the wonderful\\nfact, which must have struck every traveller, namely, that on the same\\ncontinent, under the most diverse conditions, under heat and cold, on\\nmountain and lowland, on deserts and marshes, most of the inhabitants\\nwithin each great class are plainly related; for they will generally be\\ndescendants of the same progenitors and early colonists. On this same\\nprinciple of former migration, combined in most cases with modification, we\\ncan understand, by the aid of the Glacial period, the identity of some few\\nplants, and the close alliance of many others, on the most distant\\nmountains, under the most different climates; and likewise the close\\nalliance of some of the inhabitants of the sea in the northern and southern\\ntemperate zones, though separated by the whole intertropical ocean.\\nAlthough two areas may present the same physical conditions of life, we\\nneed feel no surprise at their inhabitants being widely different, if they\\nhave been for a long period completely separated from each other; for as\\nthe relation of organism to organism is the most important of all\\nrelations, and as the two areas will have received colonists from some\\nthird source or from each other, at various periods and in different\\nproportions, the course of modification in the two areas will inevitably be\\ndifferent.\\n\\nOn this view of migration, with subsequent modification, we can see why\\noceanic islands should be inhabited by few species, but of these, that many\\nshould be peculiar. We can clearly see why those animals which cannot cross\\nwide spaces of ocean, as frogs and terrestrial mammals, should not inhabit\\noceanic islands; and why, on the other hand, new and peculiar species of\\nbats, which can traverse the ocean, should so often be found on islands far\\ndistant from any continent. Such facts {478} as the presence of peculiar\\nspecies of bats, and the absence of all other mammals, on oceanic islands,\\nare utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of creation.\\n\\nThe existence of closely allied or representative species in any two areas,\\nimplies, on the theory of descent with modification, that the same parents\\nformerly inhabited both areas; and we almost invariably find that wherever\\nmany closely allied species inhabit two areas, some identical species\\ncommon to both still exist. Wherever many closely allied yet distinct\\nspecies occur, many doubtful forms and varieties of the same species\\nlikewise occur. It is a rule of high generality that the inhabitants of\\neach area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest source whence\\nimmigrants might have been derived. We see this in nearly all the plants\\nand animals of the Galapagos archipelago, of Juan Fernandez, and of the\\nother American islands being related in the most striking manner to the\\nplants and animals of the neighbouring American mainland; and those of the\\nCape de Verde archipelago and other African islands to the African\\nmainland. It must be admitted that these facts receive no explanation on\\nthe theory of creation.\\n\\nThe fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings\\nconstitute one grand natural system, with group subordinate to group, and\\nwith extinct groups often falling in between recent groups, is intelligible\\non the theory of natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and\\ndivergence of character. On these same principles we see how it is, that\\nthe mutual affinities of the species and genera within each class are so\\ncomplex and circuitous. We see why certain characters are far more\\nserviceable than others for classification;--why adaptive characters,\\nthough of paramount importance to the being, are of hardly any {479}\\nimportance in classification; why characters derived from rudimentary\\nparts, though of no service to the being, are often of high classificatory\\nvalue; and why embryological characters are the most valuable of all. The\\nreal affinities of all organic beings are due to inheritance or community\\nof descent. The natural system is a genealogical arrangement, in which we\\nhave to discover the lines of descent by the most permanent characters,\\nhowever slight their vital importance may be.\\n\\nThe framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat,\\nfin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse,--the same number of vertebrГ¦\\nforming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant,--and innumerable other\\nsuch facts, at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow\\nand slight successive modifications. The similarity of pattern in the wing\\nand leg of a bat, though used for such different purpose,--in the jaws and\\nlegs of a crab,--in the petals, stamens, and pistils of a flower, is\\nlikewise intelligible on the view of the gradual modification of parts or\\norgans, which were alike in the early progenitor of each class. On the\\nprinciple of successive variations not always supervening at an early age,\\nand being inherited at a corresponding not early period of life, we can\\nclearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes should\\nbe so closely alike, and should be so unlike the adult forms. We may cease\\nmarvelling at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird having\\nbranchial slits and arteries running in loops, like those in a fish which\\nhas to breathe the air dissolved in water, by the aid of well-developed\\nbranchiГ¦.\\n\\nDisuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often tend to reduce an\\norgan, when it has become useless by changed habits or under changed\\nconditions {480} of life; and we can clearly understand on this view the\\nmeaning of rudimentary organs. But disuse and selection will generally act\\non each creature, when it has come to maturity and has to play its full\\npart in the struggle for existence, and will thus have little power of\\nacting on an organ during early life; hence the organ will not be much\\nreduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age. The calf, for instance,\\nhas inherited teeth, which never cut through the gums of the upper jaw,\\nfrom an early progenitor having well-developed teeth; and we may believe,\\nthat the teeth in the mature animal were reduced, during successive\\ngenerations, by disuse or by the tongue and palate having been better\\nfitted by natural selection to browse without their aid; whereas in the\\ncalf, the teeth have been left untouched by selection or disuse, and on the\\nprinciple of inheritance at corresponding ages have been inherited from a\\nremote period to the present day. On the view of each organic being and\\neach separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable\\nit is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the\\nshrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should\\nthus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! Nature may be said to\\nhave taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous\\nstructures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully\\nwill not understand.\\n\\n\\n\\nI have now recapitulated the chief facts and considerations which have\\nthoroughly convinced me that species have been modified, during a long\\ncourse of descent, by the preservation or the natural selection of many\\nsuccessive slight favourable variations. I cannot believe that a false\\ntheory would explain, as it seems to me that the theory of natural\\nselection does explain, {481} the several large classes of facts above\\nspecified. I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should\\nshock the religious feelings of any one. A celebrated author and divine has\\nwritten to me that \"he has gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble\\na conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms\\ncapable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe\\nthat He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the\\naction of His laws.\"\\n\\nWhy, it may be asked, have all the most eminent living naturalists and\\ngeologists rejected this view of the mutability of species? It cannot be\\nasserted that organic beings in a state of nature are subject to no\\nvariation; it cannot be proved that the amount of variation in the course\\nof long ages is a limited quantity; no clear distinction has been, or can\\nbe, drawn between species and well-marked varieties. It cannot be\\nmaintained that species when intercrossed are invariably sterile, and\\nvarieties invariably fertile; or that sterility is a special endowment and\\nsign of creation. The belief that species were immutable productions was\\nalmost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was thought to be of\\nshort duration; and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of\\ntime, we are too apt to assume, without proof, that the geological record\\nis so perfect that it would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation\\nof species, if they had undergone mutation.\\n\\nBut the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species\\nhas given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slow\\nin admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate\\nsteps. The difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when\\nLyell first insisted that long {482} lines of inland cliffs had been\\nformed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the coast-waves.\\nThe mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred\\nmillion years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many\\nslight variations, accumulated during an almost infinite number of\\ngenerations.\\n\\nAlthough I am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this\\nvolume under the form of an abstract, I by no means expect to convince\\nexperienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts\\nall viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directly\\nopposite to mine. It is so easy to hide our ignorance under such\\nexpressions as the \"plan of creation,\" \"unity of design,\" &c., and to think\\nthat we give an explanation when we only restate a fact. Any one whose\\ndisposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties\\nthan to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject\\nmy theory. A few naturalists, endowed with much flexibility of mind, and\\nwho have already begun to doubt on the immutability of species, may be\\ninfluenced by this volume; but I look with confidence to the future, to\\nyoung and rising naturalists, who will be able to view both sides of the\\nquestion with impartiality. Whoever is led to believe that species are\\nmutable will do good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction;\\nfor only thus can the load of prejudice by which this subject is\\noverwhelmed be removed.\\n\\nSeveral eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that a\\nmultitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species; but that\\nother species are real, that is, have been independently created. This\\nseems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at. They admit that a multitude\\nof forms, which till lately {483} they themselves thought were special\\ncreations, and which are still thus looked at by the majority of\\nnaturalists, and which consequently have every external characteristic\\nfeature of true species,--they admit that these have been produced by\\nvariation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other and very\\nslightly different forms. Nevertheless they do not pretend that they can\\ndefine, or even conjecture, which are the created forms of life, and which\\nare those produced by secondary laws. They admit variation as a _vera\\ncausa_ in one case, they arbitrarily reject it in another, without\\nassigning any distinction in the two cases. The day will come when this\\nwill be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived\\nopinion. These authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of\\ncreation than at an ordinary birth. But do they really believe that at\\ninnumerable periods in the earth\\'s history certain elemental atoms have\\nbeen commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? Do they believe that\\nat each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced? Were\\nall the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or\\nseed, or as full grown? and in the case of mammals, were they created\\nbearing the false marks of nourishment from the mother\\'s womb? Although\\nnaturalists very properly demand a full explanation of every difficulty\\nfrom those who believe in the mutability of species, on their own side they\\nignore the whole subject of the first appearance of species in what they\\nconsider reverent silence.\\n\\nIt may be asked how far I extend the doctrine of the modification of\\nspecies. The question is difficult to answer, because the more distinct the\\nforms are which we may consider, by so much the arguments fall away in\\nforce. But some arguments of the greatest weight {484} extend very far. All\\nthe members of whole classes can be connected together by chains of\\naffinities, and all can be classified on the same principle, in groups\\nsubordinate to groups. Fossil remains sometimes tend to fill up very wide\\nintervals between existing orders. Organs in a rudimentary condition\\nplainly show that an early progenitor had the organ in a fully developed\\nstate; and this in some instances necessarily implies an enormous amount of\\nmodification in the descendants. Throughout whole classes various\\nstructures are formed on the same pattern, and at an embryonic age the\\nspecies closely resemble each other. Therefore I cannot doubt that the\\ntheory of descent with modification embraces all the members of the same\\nclass. I believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five\\nprogenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number.\\n\\nAnalogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all\\nanimals and plants have descended from some one prototype. But analogy may\\nbe a deceitful guide. Nevertheless all living things have much in common,\\nin their chemical composition, their germinal vesicles, their cellular\\nstructure, and their laws of growth and reproduction. We see this even in\\nso trifling a circumstance as that the same poison often similarly affects\\nplants and animals; or that the poison secreted by the gall-fly produces\\nmonstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree. Therefore I should infer\\nfrom analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on\\nthis earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life\\nwas first breathed by the Creator.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the views advanced by me in this volume, and by Mr. Wallace in the\\nLinnean Journal, or when analogous views on the origin of species are\\ngenerally {485} admitted, we can dimly foresee that there will be a\\nconsiderable revolution in natural history. Systematists will be able to\\npursue their labours as at present; but they will not be incessantly\\nhaunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be in essence a\\nspecies. This I feel sure, and I speak after experience, will be no slight\\nrelief. The endless disputes whether or not some fifty species of British\\nbrambles are true species will cease. Systematists will have only to decide\\n(not that this will be easy) whether any form be sufficiently constant and\\ndistinct from other forms, to be capable of definition; and if definable,\\nwhether the differences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific\\nname. This latter point will become a far more essential consideration than\\nit is at present; for differences, however slight, between any two forms,\\nif not blended by intermediate gradations, are looked at by most\\nnaturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species.\\nHereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction\\nbetween species and well-marked varieties is, that the latter are known, or\\nbelieved, to be connected at the present day by intermediate gradations,\\nwhereas species were formerly thus connected. Hence, without rejecting the\\nconsideration of the present existence of intermediate gradations between\\nany two forms, we shall be led to weigh more carefully and to value higher\\nthe actual amount of difference between them. It is quite possible that\\nforms now generally acknowledged to be merely varieties may hereafter be\\nthought worthy of specific names, as with the primrose and cowslip; and in\\nthis case scientific and common language will come into accordance. In\\nshort, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those\\nnaturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial\\ncombinations {486} made for convenience. This may not be a cheering\\nprospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the\\nundiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species.\\n\\nThe other and more general departments of natural history will rise greatly\\nin interest. The terms used by naturalists of affinity, relationship,\\ncommunity of type, paternity, morphology, adaptive characters, rudimentary\\nand aborted organs, &c., will cease to be metaphorical, and will have a\\nplain signification. When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage\\nlooks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we\\nregard every production of nature as one which has had a history; when we\\ncontemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many\\ncontrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when\\nwe look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour,\\nthe experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when\\nwe thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, I speak from\\nexperience, will the study of natural history become!\\n\\nA grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened, on the causes\\nand laws of variation, on correlation of growth, on the effects of use and\\ndisuse, on the direct action of external conditions, and so forth. The\\nstudy of domestic productions will rise immensely in value. A new variety\\nraised by man will be a more important and interesting subject for study\\nthan one more species added to the infinitude of already recorded species.\\nOur classifications will come to be, as far as they can be so made,\\ngenealogies; and will then truly give what may be called the plan of\\ncreation. The rules for classifying will no doubt become simpler when we\\nhave a definite object in view. We possess no {487} pedigrees or armorial\\nbearings; and we have to discover and trace the many diverging lines of\\ndescent in our natural genealogies, by characters of any kind which have\\nlong been inherited. Rudimentary organs will speak infallibly with respect\\nto the nature of long-lost structures. Species and groups of species, which\\nare called aberrant, and which may fancifully be called living fossils,\\nwill aid us in forming a picture of the ancient forms of life. Embryology\\nwill reveal to us the structure, in some degree obscured, of the prototypes\\nof each great class.\\n\\nWhen we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species, and\\nall the closely allied species of most genera, have within a not very\\nremote period descended from one parent, and have migrated from some one\\nbirthplace; and when we better know the many means of migration, then, by\\nthe light which geology now throws, and will continue to throw, on former\\nchanges of climate and of the level of the land, we shall surely be enabled\\nto trace in an admirable manner the former migrations of the inhabitants of\\nthe whole world. Even at present, by comparing the differences of the\\ninhabitants of the sea on the opposite sides of a continent, and the nature\\nof the various inhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent\\nmeans of immigration, some light can be thrown on ancient geography.\\n\\nThe noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of\\nthe record. The crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be\\nlooked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made at hazard\\nand at rare intervals. The accumulation of each great fossiliferous\\nformation will be recognised as having depended on an unusual concurrence\\nof circumstances, and the blank intervals between the successive stages as\\nhaving been of vast duration. But we shall {488} be able to gauge with some\\nsecurity the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding\\nand succeeding organic forms. We must be cautious in attempting to\\ncorrelate as strictly contemporaneous two formations, which include few\\nidentical species, by the general succession of their forms of life. As\\nspecies are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing\\ncauses, and not by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes; and as\\nthe most important of all causes of organic change is one which is almost\\nindependent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions,\\nnamely, the mutual relation of organism to organism,--the improvement of\\none being entailing the improvement or the extermination of others; it\\nfollows, that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive\\nformations probably serves as a fair measure of the lapse of actual time. A\\nnumber of species, however, keeping in a body might remain for a long\\nperiod unchanged, whilst within this same period, several of these species,\\nby migrating into new countries and coming into competition with foreign\\nassociates, might become modified; so that we must not overrate the\\naccuracy of organic change as a measure of time. During early periods of\\nthe earth\\'s history, when the forms of life were probably fewer and\\nsimpler, the rate of change was probably slower; and at the first dawn of\\nlife, when very few forms of the simplest structure existed, the rate of\\nchange may have been slow in an extreme degree. The whole history of the\\nworld, as at present known, although of a length quite incomprehensible by\\nus, will hereafter be recognised as a mere fragment of time, compared with\\nthe ages which have elapsed since the first creature, the progenitor of\\ninnumerable extinct and living descendants, was created.\\n\\nIn the distant future I see open fields for far more {489} important\\nresearches. Psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the\\nnecessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. Light\\nwill be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\\n\\nAuthors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view\\nthat each species has been independently created. To my mind it accords\\nbetter with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the Creator,\\nthat the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of\\nthe world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining\\nthe birth and death of the individual. When I view all beings not as\\nspecial creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which\\nlived long before the first bed of the Silurian system was deposited, they\\nseem to me to become ennobled. Judging from the past, we may safely infer\\nthat not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a\\ndistant futurity. And of the species now living very few will transmit\\nprogeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which all\\norganic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species of\\neach genus, and all the species of many genera, have left no descendants,\\nbut have become utterly extinct. We can so far take a prophetic glance into\\nfuturity as to foretel that it will be the common and widely-spread\\nspecies, belonging to the larger and dominant groups, which will ultimately\\nprevail and procreate new and dominant species. As all the living forms of\\nlife are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the\\nSilurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by\\ngeneration has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated\\nthe whole world. Hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future\\nof equally inappreciable length. And as natural selection works {490}\\nsolely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental\\nendowments will tend to progress towards perfection.\\n\\nIt is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many\\nplants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various\\ninsects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and\\nto reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each\\nother, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been\\nproduced by laws acting around us. These laws, taken in the largest sense,\\nbeing Growth with Reproduction; Inheritance which is almost implied by\\nreproduction; Variability from the indirect and direct action of the\\nexternal conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a Ratio of Increase\\nso high as to lead to a Struggle for Life, and as a consequence to Natural\\nSelection, entailing Divergence of Character and the Extinction of\\nless-improved forms. Thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death,\\nthe most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the\\nproduction of the higher animals, directly follows.

inhabitants of south america, and\\nin the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that\\ncontinent. these facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of\\nspecies--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our\\ngreatest philosophers. on my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that\\nsomething might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently\\naccumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have\\nany bearing on it. after five years\\' work i allowed myself to speculate on\\nthe subject, and drew up some short notes; these i enlarged in 1844 into a\\nsketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable: from that\\nperiod to the present day i have steadily pursued the same object. i hope\\nthat i may be excused for entering on these personal details, as i give\\nthem to show that i have not been hasty in coming to a decision.\\n\\nmy work is now nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three more\\nyears to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, i have been\\nurged to publish this abstract. i have more especially been induced to do\\nthis, as mr. wallace, who is now studying the {2} natural history of the\\nmalay archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general\\nconclusions that i have on the origin of species. last year he sent me a\\nmemoir on this subject, with a request that i would forward it to sir\\ncharles lyell, who sent it to the linnean society, and it is published in\\nthe third volume of the journal of that society. sir c. lyell and dr.\\nhooker, who both knew of my work--the latter having read my sketch of\\n1844--honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with mr. wallace\\'s\\nexcellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts.\\n\\nthis abstract, which i now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. i cannot\\nhere give references and authorities for my several statements; and i must\\ntrust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy. no doubt\\nerrors will have crept in, though i hope i have always been cautious in\\ntrusting to good authorities alone. i can here give only the general\\nconclusions at which i have arrived, with a few facts in illustration, but\\nwhich, i hope, in most cases will suffice. no one can feel more sensible\\nthan i do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts,\\nwith references, on which my conclusions have been grounded; and i hope in\\na future work to do this. for i am well aware that scarcely a single point\\nis discussed in this volume on which facts cannot be adduced, often\\napparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which i\\nhave arrived. a fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and\\nbalancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question; and this\\ncannot possibly be here done.\\n\\ni much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of\\nacknowledging the generous assistance which i have received from very many\\nnaturalists, some of them personally unknown to me. i cannot, however, {3}\\nlet this opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to dr.\\nhooker, who for the last fifteen years has aided me in every possible way\\nby his large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment.\\n\\nin considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a\\nnaturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their\\nembryological relations, their geographical distribution, geological\\nsuccession, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that each\\nspecies had not been independently created, but had descended, like\\nvarieties, from other species. nevertheless, such a conclusion, even if\\nwell founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it could be shown how the\\ninnumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified, so as to\\nacquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly\\nexcites our admiration. naturalists continually refer to external\\nconditions, such as climate, food, &c., as the only possible cause of\\nvariation. in one very limited sense, as we shall hereafter see, this may\\nbe true; but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions,\\nthe structure, for instance, of the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak,\\nand tongue, so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees.\\nin the case of the misseltoe, which draws its nourishment from certain\\ntrees, which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which\\nhas flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain\\ninsects to bring pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally\\npreposterous to account for the structure of this parasite, with its\\nrelations to several distinct organic beings, by the effects of external\\nconditions, or of habit, or of the volition of the plant itself.\\n\\nthe author of the \\'vestiges of creation\\' would, i presume, say that, after\\na certain unknown number of {4} generations, some bird had given birth to a\\nwoodpecker, and some plant to the missletoe, and that these had been\\nproduced perfect as we now see them; but this assumption seems to me to be\\nno explanation, for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic\\nbeings to each other and to their physical conditions of life, untouched\\nand unexplained.\\n\\nit is, therefore, of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into\\nthe means of modification and coadaptation. at the commencement of my\\nobservations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated\\nanimals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out\\nthis obscure problem. nor have i been disappointed; in this and in all\\nother perplexing cases i have invariably found that our knowledge,\\nimperfect though it be, of variation under domestication, afforded the best\\nand safest clue. i may venture to express my conviction of the high value\\nof such studies, although they have been very commonly neglected by\\nnaturalists.\\n\\nfrom these considerations, i shall devote the first chapter of this\\nabstract to variation under domestication. we shall thus see that a large\\namount of hereditary modification is at least possible; and, what is\\nequally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of man in\\naccumulating by his selection successive slight variations. i will then\\npass on to the variability of species in a state of nature; but i shall,\\nunfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly, as it\\ncan be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts. we shall,\\nhowever, be enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to\\nvariation. in the next chapter the struggle for existence amongst all\\norganic beings throughout the world, which inevitably follows from the high\\ngeometrical ratio of their {5} increase, will be treated of. this is the\\ndoctrine of malthus, applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms. as\\nmany more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive;\\nand as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for\\nexistence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any\\nmanner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying\\nconditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be\\n_naturally selected_. from the strong principle of inheritance, any\\nselected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.\\n\\nthis fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at some\\nlength in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how natural selection\\nalmost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved forms of\\nlife, and leads to what i have called divergence of character. in the next\\nchapter i shall discuss the complex and little known laws of variation and\\nof correlation of growth. in the four succeeding chapters, the most\\napparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will be given: namely,\\nfirst, the difficulties of transitions, or in understanding how a simple\\nbeing or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly\\ndeveloped being or elaborately constructed organ; secondly, the subject of\\ninstinct, or the mental powers of animals; thirdly, hybridism, or the\\ninfertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed;\\nand fourthly, the imperfection of the geological record. in the next\\nchapter i shall consider the geological succession of organic beings\\nthroughout time; in the eleventh and twelfth, their geographical\\ndistribution throughout space; in the thirteenth, their classification or\\nmutual affinities, both when mature and in an embryonic condition. in the\\nlast chapter i shall give a {6} brief recapitulation of the whole work, and\\na few concluding remarks.\\n\\nno one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in\\nregard to the origin of species and varieties, if he makes due allowance\\nfor our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of all the\\nbeings which live around us. who can explain why one species ranges widely\\nand is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow range and\\nis rare? yet these relations are of the highest importance, for they\\ndetermine the present welfare, and, as i believe, the future success and\\nmodification of every inhabitant of this world. still less do we know of\\nthe mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the\\nmany past geological epochs in its history. although much remains obscure,\\nand will long remain obscure, i can entertain no doubt, after the most\\ndeliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which i am capable, that the\\nview which most naturalists entertain, and which i formerly\\nentertained--namely, that each species has been independently created--is\\nerroneous. i am fully convinced that species are not immutable; but that\\nthose belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants\\nof some other and generally extinct species, in the same manner as the\\nacknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that\\nspecies. furthermore, i am convinced that natural selection has been the\\nmain but not exclusive means of modification.\\n\\n       *

of\\n    selection.\\n\\nwhen we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our\\nolder cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes\\nus, is, that they generally differ more from each other than do the\\nindividuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. when we\\nreflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been\\ncultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different\\nclimates and treatment, i think we are driven to conclude that this great\\nvariability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised\\nunder conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from,\\nthose to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature. there is\\nalso, i think, some probability in the view propounded by andrew knight,\\nthat this variability may be partly connected with excess of food. it seems\\npretty clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations\\nto the new conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation;\\nand that when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally\\ncontinues to vary for many generations. {8} no case is on record of a\\nvariable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation. our oldest\\ncultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield new varieties: our\\noldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or\\nmodification.\\n\\nit has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability,\\nwhatever they may be, generally act; whether during the early or late\\nperiod of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception.\\ngeoffroy st. hilaire\\'s experiments show that unnatural treatment of the\\nembryo causes monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be separated by any\\nclear line of distinction from mere variations. but i am strongly inclined\\nto suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to\\nthe male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the\\nact of conception. several reasons make me believe in this; but the chief\\none is the remarkable effect which confinement or cultivation has on the\\nfunction of the reproductive system; this system appearing to be far more\\nsusceptible than any other part of the organisation, to the action of any\\nchange in the conditions of life. nothing is more easy than to tame an\\nanimal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under\\nconfinement, even in the many cases when the male and female unite. how\\nmany animals there are which will not breed, though living long under not\\nvery close confinement in their native country! this is generally\\nattributed to vitiated instincts; but how many cultivated plants display\\nthe utmost vigour, and yet rarely or never seed! in some few such cases it\\nhas been discovered that very trifling changes, such as a little more or\\nless water at some particular period of growth, will determine whether or\\nnot the plant sets a seed. i cannot here enter on the copious details which\\ni have collected on {9} this curious subject; but to show how singular the\\nlaws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, i\\nmay just mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in\\nthis country pretty freely under confinement, with the exception of the\\nplantigrades or bear family; whereas carnivorous birds, with the rarest\\nexceptions, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. many exotic plants have pollen\\nutterly worthless, in the same exact condition as in the most sterile\\nhybrids. when, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants,\\nthough often weak and sickly, yet breeding quite freely under confinement;\\nand when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a\\nstate of nature, perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which i could\\ngive numerous instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously\\naffected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting, we need not be\\nsurprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting not\\nquite regularly, and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents.\\n\\nsterility has been said to be the bane of horticulture; but on this view we\\nowe variability to the same cause which produces sterility; and variability\\nis the source of all the choicest productions of the garden. i may add,\\nthat as some organisms will breed freely under the most unnatural\\nconditions (for instance, the rabbit and ferret kept in hutches), showing\\nthat their reproductive system has not been thus affected; so will some\\nanimals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very\\nslightly--perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.\\n\\na long list could easily be given of \"sporting plants;\" by this term\\ngardeners mean a single bud or offset, which suddenly assumes a new and\\nsometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant. {10}\\nsuch buds can be propagated by grafting, &c., and sometimes by seed. these\\n\"sports\" are extremely rare under nature, but far from rare under\\ncultivation; and in this case we see that the treatment of the parent has\\naffected a bud or offset, and not the ovules or pollen. but it is the\\nopinion of most physiologists that there is no essential difference between\\na bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation; so that, in fact,\\n\"sports\" support my view, that variability may be largely attributed to the\\novules or pollen, or to both, having been affected by the treatment of the\\nparent prior to the act of conception. these cases anyhow show that\\nvariation is not necessarily connected, as some authors have supposed, with\\nthe act of generation.\\n\\nseedlings from the same fruit, and the young of the same litter, sometimes\\ndiffer considerably from each other, though both the young and the parents,\\nas mгјller has remarked, have apparently been exposed to exactly the same\\nconditions of life; and this shows how unimportant the direct effects of\\nthe conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of reproduction, of\\ngrowth, and of inheritance; for had the action of the conditions been\\ndirect, if any of the young had varied, all would probably have varied in\\nthe same manner. to judge how much, in the case of any variation, we should\\nattribute to the direct action of heat, moisture, light, food, &c., is most\\ndifficult: my impression is, that with animals such agencies have produced\\nvery little direct effect, though apparently more in the case of plants.\\nunder this point of view, mr. buckman\\'s recent experiments on plants are\\nextremely valuable. when all or nearly all the individuals exposed to\\ncertain conditions are affected in the same way, the change at first\\nappears to be directly due to such conditions; but in some cases it can be\\nshown that quite opposite conditions produce {11} similar changes of\\nstructure. nevertheless some slight amount of change may, i think, be\\nattributed to the direct action of the conditions of life--as, in some\\ncases, increased size from amount of food, colour from particular kinds of\\nfood or from light, and perhaps the thickness of fur from climate.\\n\\nhabit also has a decided influence, as in the period of flowering with\\nplants when transported from one climate to another. in animals it has a\\nmore marked effect; for instance, i find in the domestic duck that the\\nbones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion\\nto the whole skeleton, than do the same bones in the wild-duck; and i\\npresume that this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck\\nflying much less, and walking more, than its wild parent. the great and\\ninherited development of the udders in cows and goats in countries where\\nthey are habitually milked, in comparison with the state of these organs in\\nother countries, is another instance of the effect of use. not a single\\ndomestic animal can be named which has not in some country drooping ears;\\nand the view suggested by some authors, that the drooping is due to the\\ndisuse of the muscles of the ear, from the animals not being much alarmed\\nby danger, seems probable.\\n\\nthere are many laws regulating variation, some few of which can be dimly\\nseen, and will be hereafter briefly mentioned. i will here only allude to\\nwhat may be called correlation of growth. any change in the embryo or larva\\nwill almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal. in\\nmonstrosities, the correlations between quite distinct parts are very\\ncurious; and many instances are given in isidore geoffroy st. hilaire\\'s\\ngreat work on this subject. breeders believe that long limbs are almost\\nalways accompanied by an elongated head. some instances of correlation are\\nquite whimsical: thus {12} cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf; colour\\nand constitutional peculiarities go together, of which many remarkable\\ncases could be given amongst animals and plants. from the facts collected\\nby heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs are differently affected\\nfrom coloured individuals by certain vegetable poisons. hairless dogs have\\nimperfect teeth: long-haired and coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as\\nis asserted, long or many horns; pigeons with feathered feet have skin\\nbetween their outer toes; pigeons with short beaks have small feet, and\\nthose with long beaks large feet. hence, if man goes on selecting, and thus\\naugmenting, any peculiarity, he will almost certainly unconsciously modify\\nother parts of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of the\\ncorrelation of growth.\\n\\nthe result of the various, quite unknown, or dimly seen laws of variation\\nis infinitely complex and diversified. it is well worth while carefully to\\nstudy the several treatises published on some of our old cultivated plants,\\nas on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, &c.; and it is really\\nsurprising to note the endless points in structure and constitution in\\nwhich the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly from each other. the\\nwhole organisation seems to have become plastic, and tends to depart in\\nsome small degree from that of the parental type.\\n\\nany variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. but the number\\nand diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight\\nand those of considerable physiological importance, is endless. dr. prosper\\nlucas\\'s treatise, in two large volumes, is the fullest and the best on this\\nsubject. no breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance: like\\nproduces like is his fundamental belief: doubts have been thrown on this\\nprinciple by theoretical writers alone. when any deviation of structure\\noften appears, and we see it in the {13} father and child, we cannot tell\\nwhether it may not be due to the same cause having acted on both; but when\\namongst individuals, apparently exposed to the same conditions, any very\\nrare deviation, due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances,\\nappears in the parent--say, once amongst several million individuals--and\\nit reappears in the child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us\\nto attribute its reappearance to inheritance. every one must have heard of\\ncases of albinism, prickly skin, hairy bodies, &c., appearing in several\\nmembers of the same family. if strange and rare deviations of structure are\\ntruly inherited, less strange and commoner deviations may be freely\\nadmitted to be inheritable. perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole\\nsubject, would be, to look at the inheritance of every character whatever\\nas the rule, and non-inheritance as the anomaly.\\n\\nthe laws governing inheritance are quite unknown; no one can say why a\\npeculiarity in different individuals of the same species, or in individuals\\nof different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so; why the\\nchild often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or grandmother\\nor other more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity is often transmitted from\\none sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone, more commonly but not\\nexclusively to the like sex. it is a fact of some little importance to us,\\nthat peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often\\ntransmitted either exclusively, or in a much greater degree, to males\\nalone. a much more important rule, which i think may be trusted, is that,\\nat whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears, it tends to appear\\nin the offspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier. in many\\ncases this could not be otherwise: thus the inherited peculiarities in the\\nhorns of cattle could appear only in {14} the offspring when nearly mature;\\npeculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the corresponding\\ncaterpillar or cocoon stage. but hereditary diseases and some other facts\\nmake me believe that the rule has a wider extension, and that when there is\\nno apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age,\\nyet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at\\nwhich it first appeared in the parent. i believe this rule to be of the\\nhighest importance in explaining the laws of embryology. these remarks are\\nof course confined to the first _appearance_ of the peculiarity, and not to\\nits primary cause, which may have acted on the ovules or male element; in\\nnearly the same manner as in the crossed offspring from a short-horned cow\\nby a long-horned bull, the greater length of horn, though appearing late in\\nlife, is clearly due to the male element.\\n\\nhaving alluded to the subject of reversion, i may here refer to a statement\\noften made by naturalists--namely, that our domestic varieties, when run\\nwild, gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal\\nstocks. hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from\\ndomestic races to species in a state of nature. i have in vain endeavoured\\nto discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so\\nboldly been made. there would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we\\nmay safely conclude that very many of the most strongly-marked domestic\\nvarieties could not possibly live in a wild state. in many cases we do not\\nknow what the aboriginal stock was, and so could not tell whether or not\\nnearly perfect reversion had ensued. it would be quite necessary, in order\\nto prevent the effects of intercrossing, that only a single variety should\\nbe turned loose in its new home. nevertheless, as our varieties certainly\\ndo occasionally {15} revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms,\\nit seems to me not improbable, that if we could succeed in naturalising, or\\nwere to cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for\\ninstance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil (in which case, however, some\\neffect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil),\\nthat they would to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild\\naboriginal stock. whether or not the experiment would succeed, is not of\\ngreat importance for our line of argument; for by the experiment itself the\\nconditions of life are changed. if it could be shown that our domestic\\nvarieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion,--that is, to lose\\ntheir acquired characters, whilst kept under the same conditions, and\\nwhilst kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check,\\nby blending together, any slight deviations in their structure, in such\\ncase, i grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in\\nregard to species. but there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this\\nview: to assert that we could not breed our cart and race-horses, long and\\nshort-horned cattle, and poultry of various breeds, and esculent\\nvegetables, for an almost infinite number of generations, would be opposed\\nto all experience. i may add, that when under nature the conditions of life\\ndo change, variations and reversions of character probably do occur; but\\nnatural selection, as will hereafter be explained, will determine how far\\nthe new characters thus arising shall be preserved.\\n\\nwhen we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals\\nand plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we generally\\nperceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of\\ncharacter than in true species. domestic races of the same species, also,\\noften have a somewhat monstrous character; by which i mean, that, although\\ndiffering {16} from each other, and from other species of the same genus,\\nin several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in\\nsome one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially\\nwhen compared with all the species in nature to which they are nearest\\nallied. with these exceptions (and with that of the perfect fertility of\\nvarieties when crossed,--a subject hereafter to be discussed), domestic\\nraces of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as,\\nonly in most cases in a lesser degree than, do closely-allied species of\\nthe same genus in a state of nature. i think this must be admitted, when we\\nfind that there are hardly any domestic races, either amongst animals or\\nplants, which have not been ranked by competent judges as mere varieties,\\nand by other competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct\\nspecies. if any marked distinction existed between domestic races and\\nspecies, this source of doubt could not so perpetually recur. it has often\\nbeen stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters\\nof generic value. i think it could be shown that this statement is hardly\\ncorrect; but naturalists differ widely in determining what characters are\\nof generic value; all such valuations being at present empirical. moreover,\\non the view of the origin of genera which i shall presently give, we have\\nno right to expect often to meet with generic differences in our\\ndomesticated productions.\\n\\nwhen we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between the\\ndomestic races of the same species, we are soon involved in doubt, from not\\nknowing whether they have descended from one or several parent-species.\\nthis point, if it could be cleared up, would be interesting; if, for\\ninstance, it could be shown that the greyhound, bloodhound, terrier,\\nspaniel, and bull-dog, which we all know propagate their kind so truly,\\nwere the {17} offspring of any single species, then such facts would have\\ngreat weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very\\nclosely allied natural species--for instance, of the many foxes--inhabiting\\ndifferent quarters of the world. i do not believe, as we shall presently\\nsee, that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of the\\ndog has been produced under domestication; i believe that some small part\\nof the difference is due to their being descended from distinct species. in\\nthe case of some other domesticated species, there is presumptive, or even\\nstrong evidence, that all the breeds have descended from a single wild\\nstock.\\n\\nit has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and\\nplants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and likewise to\\nwithstand diverse climates. i do not dispute that these capacities have\\nadded largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions; but how\\ncould a savage possibly know, when he first tamed an animal, whether it\\nwould vary in succeeding generations, and whether it would endure other\\nclimates? has the little variability of the ass or guinea-fowl, or the\\nsmall power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer, or of cold by the\\ncommon camel, prevented their domestication? i cannot doubt that if other\\nanimals and plants, equal in number to our domesticated productions, and\\nbelonging to equally diverse classes and countries, were taken from a state\\nof nature, and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations\\nunder domestication, they would vary on an average as largely as the parent\\nspecies of our existing domesticated productions have varied.\\n\\nin the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants, i do\\nnot think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether they\\nhave descended from one or several wild species. the argument mainly relied\\non by those who believe in the multiple origin {18} of our domestic animals\\nis, that we find in the most ancient records, more especially on the\\nmonuments of egypt, much diversity in the breeds; and that some of the\\nbreeds closely resemble, perhaps are identical with, those still existing.\\neven if this latter fact were found more strictly and generally true than\\nseems to me to be the case, what does it show, but that some of our breeds\\noriginated there, four or five thousand years ago? but mr. horner\\'s\\nresearches have rendered it in some degree probable that man sufficiently\\ncivilized to have manufactured pottery existed in the valley of the nile\\nthirteen or fourteen thousand years ago; and who will pretend to say how\\nlong before these ancient periods, savages, like those of tierra del fuego\\nor australia, who possess a semi-domestic dog, may not have existed in\\negypt?\\n\\nthe whole subject must, i think, remain vague; nevertheless, i may, without\\nhere entering on any details, state that, from geographical and other\\nconsiderations, i think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have\\ndescended from several wild species. knowing, as we do, that savages are\\nvery fond of taming animals, it seems to me unlikely, in the case of the\\ndog-genus, which is distributed in a wild state throughout the world, that\\nsince man first appeared one single species alone should have been\\ndomesticated. in regard to sheep and goats i can form no opinion. i should\\nthink, from facts communicated to me by mr. blyth, on the habits, voice,\\nand constitution, &c., of the humped indian cattle, that these had\\ndescended from a different aboriginal stock from our european cattle; and\\nseveral competent judges believe that these latter have had more than one\\nwild parent. with respect to horses, from reasons which i cannot give here,\\ni am doubtfully inclined to believe, in opposition to several authors, that\\nall the races have descended from one {19} wild stock. mr. blyth, whose\\nopinion, from his large and varied stores of knowledge, i should value more\\nthan that of almost any one, thinks that all the breeds of poultry have\\nproceeded from the common wild indian fowl (gallus bankiva). in regard to\\nducks and rabbits, the breeds of which differ considerably from each other\\nin structure, i do not doubt that they have all descended from the common\\nwild duck and rabbit.\\n\\nthe doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several\\naboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors.\\nthey believe that every race which breeds true, let the distinctive\\ncharacters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype. at this rate\\nthere must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle, as many\\nsheep, and several goats in europe alone, and several even within great\\nbritain. one author believes that there formerly existed in great britain\\neleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it! when we bear in mind that\\nbritain has now hardly one peculiar mammal, and france but few distinct\\nfrom those of germany and conversely, and so with hungary, spain, &c., but\\nthat each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle,\\nsheep, &c, we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in\\neurope; for whence could they have been derived, as these several countries\\ndo not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parent-stocks? so\\nit is in india. even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world,\\nwhich i fully admit have probably descended from several wild species, i\\ncannot doubt that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation.\\nwho can believe that animals closely resembling the italian greyhound, the\\nbloodhound, the bull-dog, or blenheim spaniel, &c.--so unlike all wild\\ncanidг¦--ever existed freely in a state of nature? it has often been loosely\\nsaid that all our races of dogs have {20} been produced by the crossing of\\na few aboriginal species; but by crossing we can only get forms in some\\ndegree intermediate between their parents; and if we account for our\\nseveral domestic races by this process, we must admit the former existence\\nof the most extreme forms, as the italian greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog,\\n&c., in the wild state. moreover, the possibility of making distinct races\\nby crossing has been greatly exaggerated. there can be no doubt that a race\\nmay be modified by occasional crosses, if aided by the careful selection of\\nthose individual mongrels, which present any desired character; but that a\\nrace could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different\\nraces or species, i can hardly believe. sir j. sebright expressly\\nexperimentised for this object, and failed. the offspring from the first\\ncross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as i have found\\nwith pigeons) extremely uniform, and everything seems simple enough; but\\nwhen these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations,\\nhardly two of them will be alike, and then the extreme difficulty, or\\nrather utter hopelessness, of the task becomes apparent. certainly, a breed\\nintermediate between _two very distinct_ breeds could not be got without\\nextreme care and long-continued selection; nor can i find a single case on\\nrecord of a permanent race having been thus formed.\\n\\n_on the breeds of the domestic pigeon._--believing that it is always best\\nto study some special group, i have, after deliberation, taken up domestic\\npigeons. i have kept every breed which i could purchase or obtain, and have\\nbeen most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world,\\nmore especially by the hon. w. elliot from india, and by the hon. c. murray\\nfrom persia. many treatises in different languages have been published on\\npigeons, and some of them are very important, as being of {21} considerable\\nantiquity. i have associated with several eminent fanciers, and have been\\npermitted to join two of the london pigeon clubs. the diversity of the\\nbreeds is something astonishing. compare the english carrier and the\\nshort-faced tumbler, and see the wonderful difference in their beaks,\\nentailing corresponding differences in their skulls. the carrier, more\\nespecially the male bird, is also remarkable from the wonderful development\\nof the carunculated skin about the head, and this is accompanied by greatly\\nelongated eyelids, very large external orifices to the nostrils, and a wide\\ngape of mouth. the short-faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like\\nthat of a finch; and the common tumbler has the singular inherited habit of\\nflying at a great height in a compact flock, and tumbling in the air head\\nover heels. the runt is a bird of great size, with long, massive beak and\\nlarge feet; some of the sub-breeds of runts have very long necks, others\\nvery long wings and tails, others singularly short tails. the barb is\\nallied to the carrier, but, instead of a very long beak, has a very short\\nand very broad one. the pouter has a much elongated body, wings, and legs;\\nand its enormously developed crop, which it glories in inflating, may well\\nexcite astonishment and even laughter. the turbit has a very short and\\nconical beak, with a line of reversed feathers down the breast; and it has\\nthe habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the\\noesophagus. the jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of\\nthe neck that they form a hood, and it has, proportionally to its size,\\nmuch elongated wing and tail feathers. the trumpeter and laugher, as their\\nnames express, utter a very different coo from the other breeds. the\\nfantail has thirty or even forty tail feathers, instead of twelve or\\nfourteen, the normal number in all members of the great pigeon family; and\\nthese feathers are kept expanded, and are {22} carried so erect that in\\ngood birds the head and tail touch; the oil-gland is quite aborted. several\\nother less distinct breeds might be specified.\\n\\nin the skeletons of the several breeds, the development of the bones of the\\nface in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously. the shape, as\\nwell as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw, varies in a\\nhighly remarkable manner. the number of the caudal and sacral vertebrг¦\\nvary; as does the number of the ribs, together with their relative breadth\\nand the presence of processes. the size and shape of the apertures in the\\nsternum are highly variable; so is the degree of divergence and relative\\nsize of the two arms of the furcula. the proportional width of the gape of\\nmouth, the proportional length of the eyelids, of the orifice of the\\nnostrils, of the tongue (not always in strict correlation with the length\\nof beak), the size of the crop and of the upper part of the oesophagus; the\\ndevelopment and abortion of the oil-gland; the number of the primary wing\\nand caudal feathers; the relative length of wing and tail to each other and\\nto the body; the relative length of leg and of the feet; the number of\\nscutellг¦ on the toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all\\npoints of structure which are variable. the period at which the perfect\\nplumage is acquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the\\nnestling birds are clothed when hatched. the shape and size of the eggs\\nvary. the manner of flight differs remarkably; as does in some breeds the\\nvoice and disposition. lastly, in certain breeds, the males and females\\nhave come to differ to a slight degree from each other.\\n\\naltogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown to\\nan ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would\\ncertainly, i think, be ranked by him as well-defined species. moreover, i\\ndo not believe that any ornithologist would place the {23} english carrier,\\nthe short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and fantail in the\\nsame genus; more especially as in each of these breeds several\\ntruly-inherited sub-breeds, or species as he might have called them, could\\nbe shown him.\\n\\ngreat as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons, i am fully\\nconvinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that\\nall have descended from the rock-pigeon (columba livia), including under\\nthis term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each\\nother in the most trifling respects. as several of the reasons which have\\nled me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases, i will\\nhere briefly give them. if the several breeds are not varieties, and have\\nnot proceeded from the rock-pigeon, they must have descended from at least\\nseven or eight aboriginal stocks; for it is impossible to make the present\\ndomestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number: how, for instance,\\ncould a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the\\nparent-stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop? the supposed\\naboriginal stocks must all have been rock-pigeons, that is, not breeding or\\nwillingly perching on trees. but besides c. livia, with its geographical\\nsub-species, only two or three other species of rock-pigeons are known; and\\nthese have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds. hence the\\nsupposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where\\nthey were originally domesticated, and yet be unknown to ornithologists;\\nand this, considering their size, habits, and remarkable characters, seems\\nvery improbable; or they must have become extinct in the wild state. but\\nbirds breeding on precipices, and good fliers, are unlikely to be\\nexterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which has the same habits with\\nthe domestic breeds, has not been exterminated {24} even on several of the\\nsmaller british islets, or on the shores of the mediterranean. hence the\\nsupposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the\\nrock-pigeon seems to me a very rash assumption. moreover, the several\\nabove-named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the\\nworld, and, therefore, some of them must have been carried back again into\\ntheir native country; but not one has ever become wild or feral, though the\\ndovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very slightly altered state,\\nhas become feral in several places. again, all recent experience shows that\\nit is most difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under\\ndomestication; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons,\\nit must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly\\ndomesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite\\nprolific under confinement.\\n\\nan argument, as it seems to me, of great weight, and applicable in several\\nother cases, is, that the above-specified breeds, though agreeing generally\\nin constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most parts of their\\nstructure, with the wild rock-pigeon, yet are certainly highly abnormal in\\nother parts of their structure; we may look in vain throughout the whole\\ngreat family of columbidг¦ for a beak like that of the english carrier, or\\nthat of the short-faced tumbler, or barb; for reversed feathers like those\\nof the jacobin; for a crop like that of the pouter; for tail-feathers like\\nthose of the fantail. hence it must be assumed not only that half-civilized\\nman succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he\\nintentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and\\nfurther, that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown.\\nso many strange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree.\\n{25}\\n\\nsome facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve\\nconsideration. the rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, and has a white rump\\n(the indian subspecies, c. intermedia of strickland, having it bluish); the\\ntail has a terminal dark bar, with the bases of the outer feathers\\nexternally edged with white; the wings have two black bars; some\\nsemi-domestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have, besides\\nthe two black bars, the wings chequered with black. these several marks do\\nnot occur together in any other species of the whole family. now, in every\\none of the domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all the\\nabove marks, even to the white edging of the outer tail-feathers, sometimes\\nconcur perfectly developed. moreover, when two birds belonging to two\\ndistinct breeds are crossed, neither of which is blue or has any of the\\nabove-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to\\nacquire these characters; for instance, i crossed some uniformly white\\nfantails with some uniformly black barbs, and they produced mottled brown\\nand black birds; these i again crossed together, and one grandchild of the\\npure white fantail and pure black barb was of as beautiful a blue colour,\\nwith the white rump, double black wing-bar, and barred and white-edged\\ntail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! we can understand these facts, on\\nthe well-known principle of reversion to ancestral characters, if all the\\ndomestic breeds have descended from the rock-pigeon. but if we deny this,\\nwe must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions.\\neither, firstly, that all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were\\ncoloured and marked like the rock-pigeon, although no other existing\\nspecies is thus coloured and marked, so that in each separate breed there\\nmight be a tendency to revert to the very same colours and markings. or,\\nsecondly, {26} that each breed, even the purest, has within a dozen or, at\\nmost, within a score of generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon: i say\\nwithin a dozen or twenty generations, for we know of no fact countenancing\\nthe belief that the child ever reverts to some one ancestor, removed by a\\ngreater number of generations. in a breed which has been crossed only once\\nwith some distinct breed, the tendency to reversion to any character\\nderived from such cross will naturally become less and less, as in each\\nsucceeding generation there will be less of the foreign blood; but when\\nthere has been no cross with a distinct breed, and there is a tendency in\\nboth parents to revert to a character, which has been lost during some\\nformer generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to the contrary,\\nmay be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations.\\nthese two distinct cases are often confounded in treatises on inheritance.\\n\\nlastly, the hybrids or mongrels from between all the domestic breeds of\\npigeons are perfectly fertile. i can state this from my own observations,\\npurposely made, on the most distinct breeds. now, it is difficult, perhaps\\nimpossible, to bring forward one case of the hybrid offspring of two\\nanimals _clearly distinct_ being themselves perfectly fertile. some authors\\nbelieve that long-continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency\\nto sterility: from the history of the dog i think there is some probability\\nin this hypothesis, if applied to species closely related together, though\\nit is unsupported by a single experiment. but to extend the hypothesis so\\nfar as to suppose that species, aboriginally as distinct as carriers,\\ntumblers, pouters, and fantails now are, should yield offspring perfectly\\nfertile, _inter se_, seems to me rash in the extreme.\\n\\nfrom these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having\\nformerly got seven or eight supposed {27} species of pigeons to breed\\nfreely under domestication; these supposed species being quite unknown in a\\nwild state, and their becoming nowhere feral; these species having very\\nabnormal characters in certain respects, as compared with all other\\ncolumbidг¦, though so like in most other respects to the rock-pigeon; the\\nblue colour and various marks occasionally appearing in all the breeds,\\nboth when kept pure and when crossed; the mongrel offspring being perfectly\\nfertile;--from these several reasons, taken together, i can feel no doubt\\nthat all our domestic breeds have descended from the columba livia with its\\ngeographical sub-species.\\n\\nin favour of this view, i may add, firstly, that c. livia, or the\\nrock-pigeon, has been found capable of domestication in europe and in\\nindia; and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of\\nstructure with all the domestic breeds. secondly, although an english\\ncarrier or short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from\\nthe rock-pigeon, yet by comparing the several sub-breeds of these\\nvarieties, more especially those brought from distant countries, we can\\nmake an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure. thirdly,\\nthose characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed, for instance\\nthe wattle and length of beak of the carrier, the shortness of that of the\\ntumbler, and the number of tail-feathers in the fantail, are in each breed\\neminently variable; and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when\\nwe come to treat of selection. fourthly, pigeons have been watched, and\\ntended with the utmost care, and loved by many people. they have been\\ndomesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the world; the\\nearliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth г†gyptian dynasty, about\\n3000 b.c., as was pointed out to me by professor lepsius; but mr. birch\\ninforms me that pigeons are given in a bill {28} of fare in the previous\\ndynasty. in the time of the romans, as we hear from pliny, immense prices\\nwere given for pigeons; \"nay, they are come to this pass, that they can\\nreckon up their pedigree and race.\" pigeons were much valued by akber khan\\nin india, about the year 1600; never less than 20,000 pigeons were taken\\nwith the court. \"the monarchs of iran and turan sent him some very rare\\nbirds;\" and, continues the courtly historian, \"his majesty by crossing the\\nbreeds, which method was never practised before, has improved them\\nastonishingly.\" about this same period the dutch were as eager about\\npigeons as were the old romans. the paramount importance of these\\nconsiderations in explaining the immense amount of variation which pigeons\\nhave undergone, will be obvious when we treat of selection. we shall then,\\nalso, see how it is that the breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous\\ncharacter. it is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of\\ndistinct breeds, that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life;\\nand thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary.\\n\\ni have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some, yet quite\\ninsufficient, length; because when i first kept pigeons and watched the\\nseveral kinds, knowing well how true they bred, i felt fully as much\\ndifficulty in believing that they could have descended from a common\\nparent, as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard\\nto the many species of finches, or other large groups of birds, in nature.\\none circumstance has struck me much; namely, that all the breeders of the\\nvarious domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with whom i have\\never conversed, or whose treatises i have read, are firmly convinced that\\nthe several breeds to which each has attended, are descended from so many\\naboriginally distinct species. {29} ask, as i have asked, a celebrated\\nraiser of hereford cattle, whether his cattle might not have descended from\\nlong-horns, and he will laugh you to scorn. i have never met a pigeon, or\\npoultry, or duck, or rabbit fancier, who was not fully convinced that each\\nmain breed was descended from a distinct species. van mons, in his treatise\\non pears and apples, shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several\\nsorts, for instance a ribston-pippin or codlin-apple, could ever have\\nproceeded from the seeds of the same tree. innumerable other examples could\\nbe given. the explanation, i think, is simple: from long-continued study\\nthey are strongly impressed with the differences between the several races;\\nand though they well know that each race varies slightly, for they win\\ntheir prizes by selecting such slight differences, yet they ignore all\\ngeneral arguments, and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences\\naccumulated during many successive generations. may not those naturalists\\nwho, knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder, and\\nknowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of\\ndescent, yet admit that many of our domestic races have descended from the\\nsame parents--may they not learn a lesson of caution, when they deride the\\nidea of species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other\\nspecies?\\n\\n_selection._--let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races\\nhave been produced, either from one or from several allied species. some\\nlittle effect may, perhaps, be attributed to the direct action of the\\nexternal conditions of life, and some little to habit; but he would be a\\nbold man who would account by such agencies for the differences of a dray\\nand race horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler pigeon.\\none of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races {30} is that\\nwe see in them adaptation, not indeed to the animal\\'s or plant\\'s own good,\\nbut to man\\'s use or fancy. some variations useful to him have probably\\narisen suddenly, or by one step; many botanists, for instance, believe that\\nthe fuller\\'s teazle, with its hooks, which cannot be rivalled by any\\nmechanical contrivance, is only a variety of the wild dipsacus; and this\\namount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling. so it has probably\\nbeen with the turnspit dog; and this is known to have been the case with\\nthe ancon sheep. but when we compare the dray-horse and race-horse, the\\ndromedary and camel, the various breeds of sheep fitted either for\\ncultivated land or mountain pasture, with the wool of one breed good for\\none purpose, and that of another breed for another purpose; when we compare\\nthe many breeds of dogs, each good for man in very different ways; when we\\ncompare the game-cock, so pertinacious in battle, with other breeds so\\nlittle quarrelsome, with \"everlasting layers\" which never desire to sit,\\nand with the bantam so small and elegant; when we compare the host of\\nagricultural, culinary, orchard, and flower-garden races of plants, most\\nuseful to man at different seasons and for different purposes, or so\\nbeautiful in his eyes, we must, i think, look further than to mere\\nvariability. we cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced\\nas perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in several cases, we\\nknow that this has not been their history. the key is man\\'s power of\\naccumulative selection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them\\nup in certain directions useful to him. in this sense he may be said to\\nmake for himself useful breeds.\\n\\nthe great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical. it is\\ncertain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a single\\nlifetime, modified to {31} a large extent some breeds of cattle and sheep.\\nin order fully to realise what they have done, it is almost necessary to\\nread several of the many treatises devoted to this subject, and to inspect\\nthe animals. breeders habitually speak of an animal\\'s organisation as\\nsomething quite plastic, which they can model almost as they please. if i\\nhad space i could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly\\ncompetent authorities. youatt, who was probably better acquainted with the\\nworks of agriculturists than almost any other individual, and who was\\nhimself a very good judge of an animal, speaks of the principle of\\nselection as \"that which enables the agriculturist, not only to modify the\\ncharacter of his flock, but to change it altogether. it is the magician\\'s\\nwand, by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he\\npleases.\" lord somerville, speaking of what breeders have done for sheep,\\nsays:--\"it would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect\\nin itself, and then had given it existence.\" that most skilful breeder, sir\\njohn sebright, used to say, with respect to pigeons, that \"he would produce\\nany given feather in three years, but it would take him six years to obtain\\nhead and beak.\" in saxony the importance of the principle of selection in\\nregard to merino sheep is so fully recognised, that men follow it as a\\ntrade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied, like a picture by a\\nconnoisseur; this is done three times at intervals of months, and the sheep\\nare each time marked and classed, so that the very best may ultimately be\\nselected for breeding.\\n\\nwhat english breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous\\nprices given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have now been\\nexported to almost every quarter of the world. the improvement is by no\\nmeans generally due to crossing different breeds; {32} all the best\\nbreeders are strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes amongst\\nclosely allied sub-breeds. and when a cross has been made, the closest\\nselection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. if\\nselection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety, and\\nbreeding from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth\\nnotice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the\\naccumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of\\ndifferences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye--differences\\nwhich i for one have vainly attempted to appreciate. not one man in a\\nthousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent\\nbreeder. if gifted with these qualities, and he studies his subject for\\nyears, and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance, he\\nwill succeed, and may make great improvements; if he wants any of these\\nqualities, he will assuredly fail. few would readily believe in the natural\\ncapacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful\\npigeon-fancier.\\n\\nthe same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations are\\nhere often more abrupt. no one supposes that our choicest productions have\\nbeen produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock. we have\\nproofs that this is not so in some cases, in which exact records have been\\nkept; thus, to give a very trifling instance, the steadily-increasing size\\nof the common gooseberry may be quoted. we see an astonishing improvement\\nin many florists\\' flowers, when the flowers of the present day are compared\\nwith drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago. when a race of plants\\nis once pretty well established, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best\\nplants, but merely go over their seed-beds, and pull up the \"rogues,\" as\\nthey call the plants that deviate from the proper standard. with animals\\nthis {33} kind of selection is, in fact, also followed; for hardly any one\\nis so careless as to allow his worst animals to breed.\\n\\nin regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated\\neffects of selection--namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in the\\ndifferent varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the diversity\\nof leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the\\nkitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties; and\\nthe diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in comparison\\nwith the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties. see how different\\nthe leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the flowers; how\\nunlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the leaves; how\\nmuch the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size,\\ncolour, shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very slight\\ndifferences. it is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one\\npoint do not differ at all in other points; this is hardly ever, perhaps\\nnever, the case. the laws of correlation of growth, the importance of which\\nshould never be overlooked, will ensure some differences; but, as a general\\nrule, i cannot doubt that the continued selection of slight variations,\\neither in the leaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races\\ndiffering from each other chiefly in these characters.\\n\\nit may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to\\nmethodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century; it\\nhas certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises have\\nbeen published on the subject; and the result has been, in a corresponding\\ndegree, rapid and important. but it is very far from true that the\\nprinciple is a modern discovery. i could give several references to the\\nfull acknowledgment of the importance of the principle in works of high\\nantiquity. in rude and barbarous periods {34} of english history choice\\nanimals were often imported, and laws were passed to prevent their\\nexportation: the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered,\\nand this may be compared to the \"roguing\" of plants by nurserymen. the\\nprinciple of selection i find distinctly given in an ancient chinese\\nencyclopг¦dia. explicit rules are laid down by some of the roman classical\\nwriters. from passages in genesis, it is clear that the colour of domestic\\nanimals was at that early period attended to. savages now sometimes cross\\ntheir dogs with wild canine animals, to improve the breed, and they\\nformerly did so, as is attested by passages in pliny. the savages in south\\nafrica match their draught cattle by colour, as do some of the esquimaux\\ntheir teams of dogs. livingstone shows how much good domestic breeds are\\nvalued by the negroes of the interior of africa who have not associated\\nwith europeans. some of these facts do not show actual selection, but they\\nshow that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in\\nancient times, and is now attended to by the lowest savages. it would,\\nindeed, have been a strange fact, had attention not been paid to breeding,\\nfor the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious.\\n\\nat the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with a\\ndistinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior to\\nanything existing in the country. but, for our purpose, a kind of\\nselection, which may be called unconscious, and which results from every\\none trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals, is more\\nimportant. thus, a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get\\nas good dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs, but\\nhe has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed.\\nnevertheless i cannot doubt that this process, continued during centuries,\\n{35} would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as bakewell,\\ncollins, &c., by this very same process, only carried on more methodically,\\ndid greatly modify, even during their own lifetimes, the forms and\\nqualities of their cattle. slow and insensible changes of this kind could\\nnever be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the\\nbreeds in question had been made long ago, which might serve for\\ncomparison. in some cases, however, unchanged, or but little changed\\nindividuals of the same breed may be found in less civilised districts,\\nwhere the breed has been less improved. there is reason to believe that\\nking charles\\'s spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent\\nsince the time of that monarch. some highly competent authorities are\\nconvinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel, and has\\nprobably been slowly altered from it. it is known that the english pointer\\nhas been greatly changed within the last century, and in this case the\\nchange has, it is believed, been chiefly effected by crosses with the\\nfox-hound; but what concerns us is, that the change has been effected\\nunconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually, that, though the old\\nspanish pointer certainly came from spain, mr. borrow has not seen, as i am\\ninformed by him, any native dog in spain like our pointer.\\n\\nby a similar process of selection, and by careful training, the whole body\\nof english racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent\\narab stock, so that the latter, by the regulations for the goodwood races,\\nare favoured in the weights they carry. lord spencer and others have shown\\nhow the cattle of england have increased in weight and in early maturity,\\ncompared with the stock formerly kept in this country. by comparing the\\naccounts given in old pigeon treatises of carriers and tumblers with these\\nbreeds as now existing in britain, {36} india, and persia, we can, i think,\\nclearly trace the stages through which they have insensibly passed, and\\ncome to differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon.\\n\\nyouatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of\\nselection, which may be considered as unconsciously followed, in so far\\nthat the breeders could never have expected or even have wished to have\\nproduced the result which ensued--namely, the production of two distinct\\nstrains. the two flocks of leicester sheep kept by mr. buckley and mr.\\nburgess, as mr. youatt remarks, \"have been purely bred from the original\\nstock of mr. bakewell for upwards of fifty years. there is not a suspicion\\nexisting in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the\\nowner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure\\nblood of mr. bakewell\\'s flock, and yet the difference between the sheep\\npossessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance\\nof being quite different varieties.\"\\n\\nif there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited\\ncharacter of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal\\nparticularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully\\npreserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are so\\nliable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring\\nthan the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a kind of\\nunconscious selection going on. we see the value set on animals even by the\\nbarbarians of tierra del fuego, by their killing and devouring their old\\nwomen, in times of dearth, as of less value than their dogs.\\n\\nin plants the same gradual process of improvement, through the occasional\\npreservation of the best individuals, whether or not sufficiently distinct\\nto be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties, and whether\\n{37} or not two or more species or races have become blended together by\\ncrossing, may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which\\nwe now see in the varieties of the heartsease, rose, pelargonium, dahlia,\\nand other plants, when compared with the older varieties or with their\\nparent-stocks. no one would ever expect to get a first-rate heartsease or\\ndahlia from the seed of a wild plant. no one would expect to raise a\\nfirst-rate melting pear from the seed of the wild pear, though he might\\nsucceed from a poor seedling growing wild, if it had come from a\\ngarden-stock. the pear, though cultivated in classical times, appears, from\\npliny\\'s description, to have been a fruit of very inferior quality. i have\\nseen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the wonderful skill\\nof gardeners, in having produced such splendid results from such poor\\nmaterials; but the art, i cannot doubt, has been simple, and, as far as the\\nfinal result is concerned, has been followed almost unconsciously. it has\\nconsisted in always cultivating the best known variety, sowing its seeds,\\nand, when a slightly better variety has chanced to appear, selecting it,\\nand so onwards. but the gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated\\nthe best pear they could procure, never thought what splendid fruit we\\nshould eat; though we owe our excellent fruit, in some small degree, to\\ntheir having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could\\nanywhere find.\\n\\na large amount of change in our cultivated plants, thus slowly and\\nunconsciously accumulated, explains, as i believe, the well-known fact,\\nthat in a vast number of cases we cannot recognise, and therefore do not\\nknow, the wild parent-stocks of the plants which have been longest\\ncultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens. if it has taken centuries or\\nthousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their\\npresent {38} standard of usefulness to man, we can understand how it is\\nthat neither australia, the cape of good hope, nor any other region\\ninhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded us a single plant worth\\nculture. it is not that these countries, so rich in species, do not by a\\nstrange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants, but that\\nthe native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a\\nstandard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in\\ncountries anciently civilised.\\n\\nin regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should not be\\noverlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food, at\\nleast during certain seasons. and in two countries very differently\\ncircumstanced, individuals of the same species, having slightly different\\nconstitutions or structure, would often succeed better in the one country\\nthan in the other; and thus by a process of \"natural selection,\" as will\\nhereafter be more fully explained, two sub-breeds might be formed. this,\\nperhaps, partly explains what has been remarked by some authors, namely,\\nthat the varieties kept by savages have more of the character of species\\nthan the varieties kept in civilised countries.\\n\\non the view here given of the all-important part which selection by man has\\nplayed, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic races show\\nadaptation in their structure or in their habits to man\\'s wants or fancies.\\nwe can, i think, further understand the frequently abnormal character of\\nour domestic races, and likewise their differences being so great in\\nexternal characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs.\\nman can hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation of\\nstructure excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he rarely\\ncares for what is internal. he can never act by selection, excepting on\\nvariations {39} which are first given to him in some slight degree by\\nnature. no man would ever try to make a fantail, till he saw a pigeon with\\na tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter\\ntill he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size; and the more\\nabnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared, the more\\nlikely it would be to catch his attention. but to use such an expression as\\ntrying to make a fantail, is, i have no doubt, in most cases, utterly\\nincorrect. the man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail,\\nnever dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon would become through\\nlong-continued, partly unconscious and partly methodical selection. perhaps\\nthe parent bird of all fantails had only fourteen tail-feathers somewhat\\nexpanded, like the present java fantail, or like individuals of other and\\ndistinct breeds, in which as many as seventeen tail-feathers have been\\ncounted. perhaps the first pouter-pigeon did not inflate its crop much more\\nthan the turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus,--a habit which\\nis disregarded by all fanciers, as it is not one of the points of the\\nbreed.\\n\\nnor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be\\nnecessary to catch the fancier\\'s eye: he perceives extremely small\\ndifferences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however\\nslight, in one\\'s own possession. nor must the value which would formerly be\\nset on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species, be\\njudged of by the value which would now be set on them, after several breeds\\nhave once fairly been established. many slight differences might, and\\nindeed do now, arise amongst pigeons, which are rejected as faults or\\ndeviations from the standard of perfection of each breed. the common goose\\nhas not given rise to any marked varieties; hence the thoulouse and the\\ncommon breed, which differ only in colour, that {40} most fleeting of\\ncharacters, have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry-shows.\\n\\ni think these views further explain what has sometimes been\\nnoticed--namely, that we know nothing about the origin or history of any of\\nour domestic breeds. but, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language,\\ncan hardly be said to have had a definite origin. a man preserves and\\nbreeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes\\nmore care than usual in matching his best animals and thus improves them,\\nand the improved individuals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood.\\nbut as yet they will hardly have a distinct name, and from being only\\nslightly valued, their history will be disregarded. when further improved\\nby the same slow and gradual process, they will spread more widely, and\\nwill get recognised as something distinct and valuable, and will then\\nprobably first receive a provincial name. in semi-civilised countries, with\\nlittle free communication, the spreading and knowledge of any new sub-breed\\nwill be a slow process. as soon as the points of value of the new sub-breed\\nare once fully acknowledged, the principle, as i have called it, of\\nunconscious selection will always tend,--perhaps more at one period than at\\nanother, as the breed rises or falls in fashion,--perhaps more in one\\ndistrict than in another, according to the state of civilization of the\\ninhabitants,--slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed,\\nwhatever they may be. but the chance will be infinitely small of any record\\nhaving been preserved of such slow, varying, and insensible changes.\\n\\ni must now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable, or the\\nreverse, to man\\'s power of selection. a high degree of variability is\\nobviously favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to work\\non; not that mere individual differences are not amply {41} sufficient,\\nwith extreme care, to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of\\nmodification in almost any desired direction. but as variations manifestly\\nuseful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally, the chance of their\\nappearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being\\nkept; and hence this comes to be of the highest importance to success. on\\nthis principle marshall has remarked, with respect to the sheep of parts of\\nyorkshire, that \"as they generally belong to poor people, and are mostly\\n_in small lots_, they never can be improved.\" on the other hand,\\nnurserymen, from raising large stocks of the same plants, are generally far\\nmore successful than amateurs in getting new and valuable varieties. the\\nkeeping of a large number of individuals of a species in any country\\nrequires that the species should be placed under favourable conditions of\\nlife, so as to breed freely in that country. when the individuals of any\\nspecies are scanty, all the individuals, whatever their quality may be,\\nwill generally be allowed to breed, and this will effectually prevent\\nselection. but probably the most important point of all, is, that the\\nanimal or plant should be so highly useful to man, or so much valued by\\nhim, that the closest attention should be paid to even the slightest\\ndeviation in the qualities or structure of each individual. unless such\\nattention be paid nothing can be effected. i have seen it gravely remarked,\\nthat it was most fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when\\ngardeners began to attend closely to this plant. no doubt the strawberry\\nhad always varied since it was cultivated, but the slight varieties had\\nbeen neglected. as soon, however, as gardeners picked out individual plants\\nwith slightly larger, earlier, or better fruit, and raised seedlings from\\nthem, and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them, then,\\nthere appeared (aided by some {42} crossing with distinct species) those\\nmany admirable varieties of the strawberry which have been raised during\\nthe last thirty or forty years.\\n\\nin the case of animals with separate sexes, facility in preventing crosses\\nis an important element of success in the formation of new races,--at\\nleast, in a country which is already stocked with other races. in this\\nrespect enclosure of the land plays a part. wandering savages or the\\ninhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same\\nspecies. pigeons can be mated for life, and this is a great convenience to\\nthe fancier, for thus many races may be kept true, though mingled in the\\nsame aviary; and this circumstance must have largely favoured the\\nimprovement and formation of new breeds. pigeons, i may add, can be\\npropagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate, and inferior birds\\nmay be freely rejected, as when killed they serve for food. on the other\\nhand, cats, from their nocturnal rambling habits, cannot be matched, and,\\nalthough so much valued by women and children, we hardly ever see a\\ndistinct breed kept up; such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost\\nalways imported from some other country, often from islands. although i do\\nnot doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others, yet the rarity\\nor absence of distinct breeds of the cat, the donkey, peacock, goose, &c.,\\nmay be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into\\nplay: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them; in donkeys, from only a\\nfew being kept by poor people, and little attention paid to their breeding;\\nin peacocks, from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept;\\nin geese, from being valuable only for two purposes, food and feathers, and\\nmore especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of\\ndistinct breeds.\\n\\nto sum up on the origin of our domestic races of {43} animals and plants. i\\nbelieve that the conditions of life, from their action on the reproductive\\nsystem, are so far of the highest importance as causing variability. i do\\nnot believe that variability is an inherent and necessary contingency,\\nunder all circumstances, with all organic beings, as some authors have\\nthought. the effects of variability are modified by various degrees of\\ninheritance and of reversion. variability is governed by many unknown laws,\\nmore especially by that of correlation of growth. something may be\\nattributed to the direct action of the conditions of life. something must\\nbe attributed to use and disuse. the final result is thus rendered\\ninfinitely complex. in some cases, i do not doubt that the intercrossing of\\nspecies, aboriginally distinct, has played an important part in the origin\\nof our domestic productions. when in any country several domestic breeds\\nhave once been established, their occasional intercrossing, with the aid of\\nselection, has, no doubt, largely aided in the formation of new sub-breeds;\\nbut the importance of the crossing of varieties has, i believe, been\\ngreatly exaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which\\nare propagated by seed. in plants which are temporarily propagated by\\ncuttings, buds, &c., the importance of the crossing both of distinct\\nspecies and of varieties is immense; for the cultivator here quite\\ndisregards the extreme variability both of hybrids and mongrels, and the\\nfrequent sterility of hybrids; but the cases of plants not propagated by\\nseed are of little importance to us, for their endurance is only temporary.\\nover all these causes of change i am convinced that the accumulative action\\nof selection, whether applied methodically and more quickly, or\\nunconsciously and more slowly, but more efficiently, is by far the\\npredominant power.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{44}\\n\\nchapter ii.\\n\\nvariation under nature.\\n\\n    variability--individual differences--doubtful species--wide ranging,\\n    much diffused, and common species vary most--species of the larger\\n    genera in any country vary more than the species of the smaller\\n    genera--many of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in\\n    being very closely, but unequally, related to each other, and in having\\n    restricted ranges.\\n\\nbefore applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic\\nbeings in a state of nature, we must briefly discuss whether these latter\\nare subject to any variation. to treat this subject at all properly, a long\\ncatalogue of dry facts should be given; but these i shall reserve for my\\nfuture work. nor shall i here discuss the various definitions which have\\nbeen given of the term species. no one definition has as yet satisfied all\\nnaturalists; yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he\\nspeaks of a species. generally the term includes the unknown element of a\\ndistinct act of creation. the term \"variety\" is almost equally difficult to\\ndefine; but here community of descent is almost universally implied, though\\nit can rarely be proved. we have also what are called monstrosities; but\\nthey graduate into varieties. by a monstrosity i presume is meant some\\nconsiderable deviation of structure in one part, either injurious to or not\\nuseful to the species, and not generally propagated. some authors use the\\nterm \"variation\" in a technical sense, as implying a modification directly\\ndue to the physical conditions of life; and \"variations\" in this sense are\\nsupposed not to be inherited: but who can say that the dwarfed condition of\\nshells in the brackish waters of the baltic, or dwarfed {45} plants on\\nalpine summits, or the thicker fur of an animal from far northwards, would\\nnot in some cases be inherited for at least some few generations? and in\\nthis case i presume that the form would be called a variety.\\n\\nagain, we have many slight differences which may be called individual\\ndifferences, such as are known frequently to appear in the offspring from\\nthe same parents, or which may be presumed to have thus arisen, from being\\nfrequently observed in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the\\nsame confined locality. no one supposes that all the individuals of the\\nsame species are cast in the very same mould. these individual differences\\nare highly important for us, as they afford materials for natural selection\\nto accumulate, in the same manner as man can accumulate in any given\\ndirection individual differences in his domesticated productions. these\\nindividual differences generally affect what naturalists consider\\nunimportant parts; but i could show by a long catalogue of facts, that\\nparts which must be called important, whether viewed under a physiological\\nor classificatory point of view, sometimes vary in the individuals of the\\nsame species. i am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be\\nsurprised at the number of the cases of variability, even in important\\nparts of structure, which he could collect on good authority, as i have\\ncollected, during a course of years. it should be remembered that\\nsystematists are far from pleased at finding variability in important\\ncharacters, and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine\\ninternal and important organs, and compare them in many specimens of the\\nsame species. i should never have expected that the branching of the main\\nnerves close to the great central ganglion of an insect would have been\\nvariable in the same species; i should have expected that changes of this\\nnature could have been effected only {46} by slow degrees: yet quite\\nrecently mr. lubbock has shown a degree of variability in these main nerves\\nin coccus, which may almost be compared to the irregular branching of the\\nstem of a tree. this philosophical naturalist, i may add, has also quite\\nrecently shown that the muscles in the larvг¦ of certain insects are very\\nfar from uniform. authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that\\nimportant organs never vary; for these same authors practically rank that\\ncharacter as important (as some few naturalists have honestly confessed)\\nwhich does not vary; and, under this point of view, no instance of an\\nimportant part varying will ever be found: but under any other point of\\nview many instances assuredly can be given.\\n\\nthere is one point connected with individual differences, which seems to me\\nextremely perplexing: i refer to those genera which have sometimes been\\ncalled \"protean\" or \"polymorphic,\" in which the species present an\\ninordinate amount of variation; and hardly two naturalists can agree which\\nforms to rank as species and which as varieties. we may instance rubus,\\nrosa, and hieracium amongst plants, several genera of insects, and several\\ngenera of brachiopod shells. in most polymorphic genera some of the species\\nhave fixed and definite characters. genera which are polymorphic in one\\ncountry seem to be, with some few exceptions, polymorphic in other\\ncountries, and likewise, judging from brachiopod shells, at former periods\\nof time. these facts seem to be very perplexing, for they seem to show that\\nthis kind of variability is independent of the conditions of life. i am\\ninclined to suspect that we see in these polymorphic genera variations in\\npoints of structure which are of no service or disservice to the species,\\nand which consequently have not been seized on and rendered definite by\\nnatural selection, as hereafter will be explained. {47}\\n\\nthose forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of\\nspecies, but which are so closely similar to some other forms, or are so\\nclosely linked to them by intermediate gradations, that naturalists do not\\nlike to rank them as distinct species, are in several respects the most\\nimportant for us. we have every reason to believe that many of these\\ndoubtful and closely-allied forms have permanently retained their\\ncharacters in their own country for a long time; for as long, as far as we\\nknow, as have good and true species. practically, when a naturalist can\\nunite two forms together by others having intermediate characters, he\\ntreats the one as a variety of the other, ranking the most common, but\\nsometimes the one first described, as the species, and the other as the\\nvariety. but cases of great difficulty, which i will not here enumerate,\\nsometimes occur in deciding whether or not to rank one form as a variety of\\nanother, even when they are closely connected by intermediate links; nor\\nwill the commonly-assumed hybrid nature of the intermediate links always\\nremove the difficulty. in very many cases, however, one form is ranked as a\\nvariety of another, not because the intermediate links have actually been\\nfound, but because analogy leads the observer to suppose either that they\\ndo now somewhere exist, or may formerly have existed; and here a wide door\\nfor the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened.\\n\\nhence, in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or a\\nvariety, the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide\\nexperience seems the only guide to follow. we must, however, in many cases,\\ndecide by a majority of naturalists, for few well-marked and well-known\\nvarieties can be named which have not been ranked as species by at least\\nsome competent judges. {48}\\n\\nthat varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be\\ndisputed. compare the several floras of great britain, of france or of the\\nunited states, drawn up by different botanists, and see what a surprising\\nnumber of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good species, and by\\nanother as mere varieties. mr. h. c. watson, to whom i lie under deep\\nobligation for assistance of all kinds, has marked for me 182 british\\nplants, which are generally considered as varieties, but which have all\\nbeen ranked by botanists as species; and in making this list he has omitted\\nmany trifling varieties, but which nevertheless have been ranked by some\\nbotanists as species, and he has entirely omitted several highly\\npolymorphic genera. under genera, including the most polymorphic forms, mr.\\nbabington gives 251 species, whereas mr. bentham gives only 112,--a\\ndifference of 139 doubtful forms! amongst animals which unite for each\\nbirth, and which are highly locomotive, doubtful forms, ranked by one\\nzoologist as a species and by another as a variety, can rarely be found\\nwithin the same country, but are common in separated areas. how many of\\nthose birds and insects in north america and europe, which differ very\\nslightly from each other, have been ranked by one eminent naturalist as\\nundoubted species, and by another as varieties, or, as they are often\\ncalled, as geographical races! many years ago, when comparing, and seeing\\nothers compare, the birds from the separate islands of the galapagos\\narchipelago, both one with another, and with those from the american\\nmainland, i was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the\\ndistinction between species and varieties. on the islets of the little\\nmadeira group there are many insects which are characterized as varieties\\nin mr. wollaston\\'s admirable work, but which it cannot {49} be doubted\\nwould be ranked as distinct species by many entomologists. even ireland has\\na few animals, now generally regarded as varieties, but which have been\\nranked as species by some zoologists. several most experienced\\nornithologists consider our british red grouse as only a strongly-marked\\nrace of a norwegian species, whereas the greater number rank it as an\\nundoubted species peculiar to great britain. a wide distance between the\\nhomes of two doubtful forms leads many naturalists to rank both as distinct\\nspecies; but what distance, it has been well asked, will suffice? if that\\nbetween america and europe is ample, will that between the continent and\\nthe azores, or madeira, or the canaries, or ireland, be sufficient? it must\\nbe admitted that many forms, considered by highly-competent judges as\\nvarieties, have so perfectly the character of species that they are ranked\\nby other highly-competent judges as good and true species. but to discuss\\nwhether they are rightly called species or varieties, before any definition\\nof these terms has been generally accepted, is vainly to beat the air.\\n\\nmany of the cases of strongly-marked varieties or doubtful species well\\ndeserve consideration; for several interesting lines of argument, from\\ngeographical distribution, analogical variation, hybridism, &c., have been\\nbrought to bear on the attempt to determine their rank. i will here give\\nonly a single instance,--the well-known one of the primrose and cowslip, or\\nprimula vulgaris and veris. these plants differ considerably in appearance;\\nthey have a different flavour, and emit a different odour; they flower at\\nslightly different periods; they grow in somewhat different stations; they\\nascend mountains to different heights; they have different geographical\\nranges; and lastly, according to very numerous experiments made during\\nseveral years by {50} that most careful observer gг¤rtner, they can be\\ncrossed only with much difficulty. we could hardly wish for better evidence\\nof the two forms being specifically distinct. on the other hand, they are\\nunited by many intermediate links, and it is very doubtful whether these\\nlinks are hybrids; and there is, as it seems to me, an overwhelming amount\\nof experimental evidence, showing that they descend from common parents,\\nand consequently must be ranked as varieties.\\n\\nclose investigation, in most cases, will bring naturalists to an agreement\\nhow to rank doubtful forms. yet it must be confessed that it is in the\\nbest-known countries that we find the greatest number of forms of doubtful\\nvalue. i have been struck with the fact, that if any animal or plant in a\\nstate of nature be highly useful to man, or from any cause closely attract\\nhis attention, varieties of it will almost universally be found recorded.\\nthese varieties, moreover, will be often ranked by some authors as species.\\nlook at the common oak, how closely it has been studied; yet a german\\nauthor makes more than a dozen species out of forms, which are very\\ngenerally considered as varieties; and in this country the highest\\nbotanical authorities and practical men can be quoted to show that the\\nsessile and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct species or mere\\nvarieties.\\n\\nwhen a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms quite\\nunknown to him, he is at first much perplexed to determine what differences\\nto consider as specific, and what as varieties; for he knows nothing of the\\namount and kind of variation to which the group is subject; and this shows,\\nat least, how very generally there is some variation. but if he confine his\\nattention to one class within one country, he will soon make up his mind\\nhow to rank most of the doubtful forms. his {51} general tendency will be\\nto make many species, for he will become impressed, just like the pigeon or\\npoultry fancier before alluded to, with the amount of difference in the\\nforms which he is continually studying; and he has little general knowledge\\nof analogical variation in other groups and in other countries, by which to\\ncorrect his first impressions. as he extends the range of his observations,\\nhe will meet with more cases of difficulty; for he will encounter a greater\\nnumber of closely-allied forms. but if his observations be widely extended,\\nhe will in the end generally be enabled to make up his own mind which to\\ncall varieties and which species; but he will succeed in this at the\\nexpense of admitting much variation,--and the truth of this admission will\\noften be disputed by other naturalists. when, moreover, he comes to study\\nallied forms brought from countries not now continuous, in which case he\\ncan hardly hope to find the intermediate links between his doubtful forms,\\nhe will have to trust almost entirely to analogy, and his difficulties rise\\nto a climax.\\n\\ncertainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between\\nspecies and sub-species--that is, the forms which in the opinion of some\\nnaturalists come very near to, but do not quite arrive at the rank of\\nspecies; or, again, between sub-species and well-marked varieties, or\\nbetween lesser varieties and individual differences. these differences\\nblend into each other in an insensible series; and a series impresses the\\nmind with the idea of an actual passage.\\n\\nhence i look at individual differences, though of small interest to the\\nsystematist, as of high importance for us, as being the first step towards\\nsuch slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in works on\\nnatural history. and i look at varieties which are in any degree more\\ndistinct and permanent, as steps leading to more {52} strongly marked and\\nmore permanent varieties; and at these latter, as leading to sub-species,\\nand to species. the passage from one stage of difference to another and\\nhigher stage may be, in some cases, due merely to the long-continued action\\nof different physical conditions in two different regions; but i have not\\nmuch faith in this view; and i attribute the passage of a variety, from a\\nstate in which it differs very slightly from its parent to one in which it\\ndiffers more, to the action of natural selection in accumulating (as will\\nhereafter be more fully explained) differences of structure in certain\\ndefinite directions. hence i believe a well-marked variety may be called an\\nincipient species; but whether this belief be justifiable must be judged of\\nby the general weight of the several facts and views given throughout this\\nwork.\\n\\nit need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species necessarily\\nattain the rank of species. they may whilst in this incipient state become\\nextinct, or they may endure as varieties for very long periods, as has been\\nshown to be the case by mr. wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil\\nland-shells in madeira. if a variety were to flourish so as to exceed in\\nnumbers the parent species, it would then rank as the species, and the\\nspecies as the variety; or it might come to supplant and exterminate the\\nparent species; or both might co-exist, and both rank as independent\\nspecies. but we shall hereafter have to return to this subject.\\n\\nfrom these remarks it will be seen that i look at the term species, as one\\narbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals\\nclosely resembling each other, and that it does not essentially differ from\\nthe term variety, which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating\\nforms. the term variety, again, in comparison with mere individual\\ndifferences, is also applied arbitrarily, and for mere convenience\\' sake.\\n{53}\\n\\nguided by theoretical considerations, i thought that some interesting\\nresults might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the\\nspecies which vary most, by tabulating all the varieties in several\\nwell-worked floras. at first this seemed a simple task; but mr. h. c.\\nwatson, to whom i am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance on\\nthis subject, soon convinced me that there were many difficulties, as did\\nsubsequently dr. hooker, even in stronger terms. i shall reserve for my\\nfuture work the discussion of these difficulties, and the tables themselves\\nof the proportional numbers of the varying species. dr. hooker permits me\\nto add, that after having carefully read my manuscript, and examined the\\ntables, he thinks that the following statements are fairly well\\nestablished. the whole subject, however, treated as it necessarily here is\\nwith much brevity, is rather perplexing, and allusions cannot be avoided to\\nthe \"struggle for existence,\" \"divergence of character,\" and other\\nquestions, hereafter to be discussed.\\n\\nalph. de candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wide\\nranges generally present varieties; and this might have been expected, as\\nthey become exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as they come into\\ncompetition (which, as we shall hereafter see, is a far more important\\ncircumstance) with different sets of organic beings. but my tables further\\nshow that, in any limited country, the species which are most common, that\\nis abound most in individuals, and the species which are most widely\\ndiffused within their own country (and this is a different consideration\\nfrom wide range, and to a certain extent from commonness), often give rise\\nto varieties sufficiently well-marked to have been recorded in botanical\\nworks. hence it is the most flourishing, or, as they may be called, the\\ndominant species,--those {54} which range widely over the world, are the\\nmost diffused in their own country, and are the most numerous in\\nindividuals,--which oftenest produce well-marked varieties, or, as i\\nconsider them, incipient species. and this, perhaps, might have been\\nanticipated; for, as varieties, in order to become in any degree permanent,\\nnecessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of the country, the\\nspecies which are already dominant will be the most likely to yield\\noffspring, which, though in some slight degree modified, still inherit\\nthose advantages that enabled their parents to become dominant over their\\ncompatriots.\\n\\nif the plants inhabiting a country and described in any flora be divided\\ninto two equal masses, all those in the larger genera being placed on one\\nside, and all those in the smaller genera on the other side, a somewhat\\nlarger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant species will\\nbe found on the side of the larger genera. this, again, might have been\\nanticipated; for the mere fact of many species of the same genus inhabiting\\nany country, shows that there is something in the organic or inorganic\\nconditions of that country favourable to the genus; and, consequently, we\\nmight have expected to have found in the larger genera, or those including\\nmany species, a large proportional number of dominant species. but so many\\ncauses tend to obscure this result, that i am surprised that my tables show\\neven a small majority on the side of the larger genera. i will here allude\\nto only two causes of obscurity. fresh-water and salt-loving plants have\\ngenerally very wide ranges and are much diffused, but this seems to be\\nconnected with the nature of the stations inhabited by them, and has little\\nor no relation to the size of the genera to which the species belong.\\nagain, plants low in the scale of organisation are {55} generally much more\\nwidely diffused than plants higher in the scale; and here again there is no\\nclose relation to the size of the genera. the cause of lowly-organised\\nplants ranging widely will be discussed in our chapter on geographical\\ndistribution.\\n\\nfrom looking at species as only strongly-marked and well-defined varieties,\\ni was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera in each\\ncountry would oftener present varieties, than the species of the smaller\\ngenera; for wherever many closely related species (_i.e._ species of the\\nsame genus) have been formed, many varieties or incipient species ought, as\\na general rule, to be now forming. where many large trees grow, we expect\\nto find saplings. where many species of a genus have been formed through\\nvariation, circumstances have been favourable for variation; and hence we\\nmight expect that the circumstances would generally be still favourable to\\nvariation. on the other hand, if we look at each species as a special act\\nof creation, there is no apparent reason why more varieties should occur in\\na group having many species, than in one having few.\\n\\nto test the truth of this anticipation i have arranged the plants of twelve\\ncountries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts, into two nearly\\nequal masses, the species of the larger genera on one side, and those of\\nthe smaller genera on the other side, and it has invariably proved to be\\nthe case that a larger proportion of the species on the side of the larger\\ngenera present varieties, than on the side of the smaller genera. moreover,\\nthe species of the large genera which present any varieties, invariably\\npresent a larger average number of varieties than do the species of the\\nsmall genera. both these results follow when another division is made, and\\nwhen all the smallest genera, with from only one to four species, are\\nabsolutely excluded from the tables. these {56} facts are of plain\\nsignification on the view that species are only strongly marked and\\npermanent varieties; for wherever many species of the same genus have been\\nformed, or where, if we may use the expression, the manufactory of species\\nhas been active, we ought generally to find the manufactory still in\\naction, more especially as we have every reason to believe the process of\\nmanufacturing new species to be a slow one. and this certainly is the case,\\nif varieties be looked at as incipient species; for my tables clearly show\\nas a general rule that, wherever many species of a genus have been formed,\\nthe species of that genus present a number of varieties, that is of\\nincipient species beyond the average. it is not that all large genera are\\nnow varying much, and are thus increasing in the number of their species,\\nor that no small genera are now varying and increasing; for if this had\\nbeen so, it would have been fatal to my theory; inasmuch as geology plainly\\ntells us that small genera have in the lapse of time often increased\\ngreatly in size; and that large genera have often come to their maxima,\\ndeclined, and disappeared. all that we want to show is, that where many\\nspecies of a genus have been formed, on an average many are still forming;\\nand this holds good.\\n\\nthere are other relations between the species of large genera and their\\nrecorded varieties which deserve notice. we have seen that there is no\\ninfallible criterion by which to distinguish species and well-marked\\nvarieties; and in those cases in which intermediate links have not been\\nfound between doubtful forms, naturalists are compelled to come to a\\ndetermination by the amount of difference between them, judging by analogy\\nwhether or not the amount suffices to raise one or both to the rank of\\nspecies. hence the amount of difference is one very important criterion in\\nsettling whether two forms {57} should be ranked as species or varieties.\\nnow fries has remarked in regard to plants, and westwood in regard to\\ninsects, that in large genera the amount of difference between the species\\nis often exceedingly small. i have endeavoured to test this numerically by\\naverages, and, as far as my imperfect results go, they confirm the view. i\\nhave also consulted some sagacious and experienced observers, and, after\\ndeliberation, they concur in this view. in this respect, therefore, the\\nspecies of the larger genera resemble varieties, more than do the species\\nof the smaller genera. or the case may be put in another way, and it may be\\nsaid, that in the larger genera, in which a number of varieties or\\nincipient species greater than the average are now manufacturing, many of\\nthe species already manufactured still to a certain extent resemble\\nvarieties, for they differ from each other by a less than usual amount of\\ndifference.\\n\\nmoreover, the species of the large genera are related to each other, in the\\nsame manner as the varieties of any one species are related to each other.\\nno naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are equally distinct\\nfrom each other; they may generally be divided into sub-genera, or\\nsections, or lesser groups. as fries has well remarked, little groups of\\nspecies are generally clustered like satellites around certain other\\nspecies. and what are varieties but groups of forms, unequally related to\\neach other, and clustered round certain forms--that is, round their\\nparent-species? undoubtedly there is one most important point of difference\\nbetween varieties and species; namely, that the amount of difference\\nbetween varieties, when compared with each other or with their\\nparent-species, is much less than that between the species of the same\\ngenus. but when we come to discuss the principle, as i call it, of\\ndivergence of character, {58} we shall see how this may be explained, and\\nhow the lesser differences between varieties will tend to increase into the\\ngreater differences between species.\\n\\nthere is one other point which seems to me worth notice. varieties\\ngenerally have much restricted ranges: this statement is indeed scarcely\\nmore than a truism, for if a variety were found to have a wider range than\\nthat of its supposed parent-species, their denominations ought to be\\nreversed. but there is also reason to believe, that those species which are\\nvery closely allied to other species, and in so far resemble varieties,\\noften have much restricted ranges. for instance, mr. h. c. watson has\\nmarked for me in the well-sifted london catalogue of plants (4th edition)\\n63 plants which are therein ranked as species, but which he considers as so\\nclosely allied to other species as to be of doubtful value: these 63\\nreputed species range on an average over 6.9 of the provinces into which\\nmr. watson has divided great britain. now, in this same catalogue, 53\\nacknowledged varieties are recorded, and these range over 7.7 provinces;\\nwhereas, the species to which these varieties belong range over 14.3\\nprovinces. so that the acknowledged varieties have very nearly the same\\nrestricted average range, as have those very closely allied forms, marked\\nfor me by mr. watson as doubtful species, but which are almost universally\\nranked by british botanists as good and true species.\\n\\n\\n\\nfinally, then, varieties have the same general characters as species, for\\nthey cannot be distinguished from species,--except, firstly, by the\\ndiscovery of intermediate linking forms, and the occurrence of such links\\ncannot affect the actual characters of the forms which they connect; and\\nexcept, secondly by a certain amount of {59} difference, for two forms, if\\ndiffering very little, are generally ranked as varieties, notwithstanding\\nthat intermediate linking forms have not been discovered; but the amount of\\ndifference considered necessary to give to two forms the rank of species is\\nquite indefinite. in genera having more than the average number of species\\nin any country, the species of these genera have more than the average\\nnumber of varieties. in large genera the species are apt to be closely, but\\nunequally allied together, forming little clusters round certain species.\\nspecies very closely allied to other species apparently have restricted\\nranges. in all these several respects the species of large genera present a\\nstrong analogy with varieties. and we can clearly understand these\\nanalogies, if species have once existed as varieties, and have thus\\noriginated: whereas, these analogies are utterly inexplicable if each\\nspecies has been independently created.\\n\\nwe have, also, seen that it is the most flourishing or dominant species of\\nthe larger genera which on an average vary most; and varieties, as we shall\\nhereafter see, tend to become converted into new and distinct species. the\\nlarger genera thus tend to become larger; and throughout nature the forms\\nof life which are now dominant tend to become still more dominant by\\nleaving many modified and dominant descendants. but by steps hereafter to\\nbe explained, the larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera.\\nand thus, the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into\\ngroups subordinate to groups.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{60}\\n\\nchapter iii.\\n\\nstruggle for existence.\\n\\n    bears on natural selection--the term used in a wide sense--geometrical\\n    powers of increase--rapid increase of naturalised animals and\\n    plants--nature of the checks to

severe between individuals and varieties\\n    of the same species; often severe between species of the same\\n    genus--the relation of organism to organism the most important of all\\n    relations.\\n\\nbefore entering on the subject of this chapter, i must make a few\\npreliminary remarks, to show how the struggle for existence bears on\\nnatural selection. it has been seen in the last chapter that amongst\\norganic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variability:\\nindeed i am not aware that this has ever been disputed. it is immaterial\\nfor us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called species or\\nsub-species or varieties; what rank, for instance, the two or three hundred\\ndoubtful forms of british plants are entitled to hold, if the existence of\\nany well-marked varieties be admitted. but the mere existence of individual\\nvariability and of some few well-marked varieties, though necessary as the\\nfoundation for the work, helps us but little in understanding how species\\narise in nature. how have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of\\nthe organisation to another part, and to the conditions of life, and of one\\ndistinct organic being to another being, been perfected? we see these\\nbeautiful co-adaptations most {61} plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe;\\nand only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the\\nhairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird; in the structure of the beetle\\nwhich dives through the water; in the plumed seed which is wafted by the\\ngentlest breeze; in short, we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in\\nevery part of the organic world.\\n\\nagain, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which i have called\\nincipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct\\nspecies, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more than\\ndo the varieties of the same species? how do those groups of species, which\\nconstitute what are called distinct genera, and which differ from each\\nother more than do the species of the same genus, arise? all these results,\\nas we shall more fully see in the next chapter, follow from the struggle\\nfor life. owing to this struggle for life, any variation, however slight,\\nand from whatever cause proceeding, if it be in any degree profitable to an\\nindividual of any species, in its infinitely complex relations to other\\norganic beings and to external nature, will tend to the preservation of\\nthat individual, and will generally be inherited by its offspring. the\\noffspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the\\nmany individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small\\nnumber can survive. i have called this principle, by which each slight\\nvariation, if useful, is preserved, by the term of natural selection, in\\norder to mark its relation to man\\'s power of selection. we have seen that\\nman by selection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt organic\\nbeings to his own uses, through the accumulation of slight but useful\\nvariations, given to him by the hand of nature. but natural selection, as\\nwe shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as\\n{62} immeasurably superior to man\\'s feeble efforts, as the works of nature\\nare to those of art.\\n\\nwe will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence. in\\nmy future work this subject shall be treated, as it well deserves, at much\\ngreater length. the elder de candolle and lyell have largely and\\nphilosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe\\ncompetition. in regard to plants, no one has treated this subject with more\\nspirit and ability than w. herbert, dean of manchester, evidently the\\nresult of his great horticultural knowledge. nothing is easier than to\\nadmit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life, or more\\ndifficult--at least i have found it so--than constantly to bear this\\nconclusion in mind. yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind, i am\\nconvinced that the whole economy of nature, with every fact on\\ndistribution, rarity, abundance, extinction, and variation, will be dimly\\nseen or quite misunderstood. we behold the face of nature bright with\\ngladness, we often see superabundance of food; we do not see, or we forget\\nthat the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or\\nseeds, and are thus constantly destroying life; or we forget how largely\\nthese songsters, or their eggs, or their nestlings, are destroyed by birds\\nand beasts of prey; we do not always bear in mind, that though food may be\\nnow superabundant, it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year.\\n\\ni should premise that i use the term struggle for existence in a large and\\nmetaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another, and\\nincluding (which is more important) not only the life of the individual,\\nbut success in leaving progeny. two canine animals in a time of dearth, may\\nbe truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live.\\nbut a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle {63} for life\\nagainst the drought, though more properly it should be said to be dependent\\non the moisture. a plant which annually produces a thousand seeds, of which\\non an average only one comes to maturity, may be more truly said to\\nstruggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe\\nthe ground. the missletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees,\\nbut can only in a far-fetched sense be said to struggle with these trees,\\nfor if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree, it will languish\\nand die. but several seedling missletoes, growing close together on the\\nsame branch, may more truly be said to struggle with each other. as the\\nmissletoe is disseminated by birds, its existence depends on birds; and it\\nmay metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in\\norder to tempt birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than\\nthose of other plants. in these several senses, which pass into each other,\\ni use for convenience\\' sake the general term of struggle for existence.\\n\\na struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which all\\norganic beings tend to increase. every being, which during its natural\\nlifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction during\\nsome period of its life, and during some season or occasional year,\\notherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers would\\nquickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the\\nproduct. hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive,\\nthere must in every case be a struggle for existence, either one individual\\nwith another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct\\nspecies, or with the physical conditions of life. it is the doctrine of\\nmalthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable\\nkingdoms; for in this case there {64} can be no artificial increase of\\nfood, and no prudential restraint from marriage. although some species may\\nbe now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for\\nthe world would not hold them.\\n\\nthere is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally\\nincreases at so high a rate, that if not destroyed, the earth would soon be\\ncovered by the progeny of a single pair. even slow-breeding man has doubled\\nin twenty-five years, and at this rate, in a few thousand years, there\\nwould literally not be standing room for his progeny. linnг¦us has\\ncalculated that if an annual plant produced only two seeds--and there is no\\nplant so unproductive as this--and their seedlings next year produced two,\\nand so on, then in twenty years there would be a million plants. the\\nelephant is reckoned the slowest breeder of all known animals, and i have\\ntaken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase:\\nit will be under the mark to assume that it breeds when thirty years old,\\nand goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing forth three pair of\\nyoung in this interval; if this be so, at the end of the fifth century\\nthere would be alive fifteen million elephants, descended from the first\\npair.\\n\\nbut we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical\\ncalculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly\\nrapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when circumstances\\nhave been favourable to them during two or three following seasons. still\\nmore striking is the evidence from our domestic animals of many kinds which\\nhave run wild in several parts of the world: if the statements of the rate\\nof increase of slow-breeding cattle and horses in south america, and\\nlatterly in australia, had not been well authenticated, they would have\\nbeen incredible. so it is with plants: cases could be given of {65}\\nintroduced plants which have become common throughout whole islands in a\\nperiod of less than ten years. several of the plants, such as the cardoon\\nand a tall thistle, now most numerous over the wide plains of la plata,\\nclothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of all other\\nplants, have been introduced from europe; and there are plants which now\\nrange in india, as i hear from dr. falconer, from cape comorin to the\\nhimalaya, which have been imported from america since its discovery. in\\nsuch cases, and endless instances could be given, no one supposes that the\\nfertility of these animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily\\nincreased in any sensible degree. the obvious explanation is that the\\nconditions of life have been very favourable, and that there has\\nconsequently been less destruction of the old and young, and that nearly\\nall the young have been enabled to breed. in such cases the geometrical\\nratio of increase, the result of which never fails to be surprising, simply\\nexplains the extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion of\\nnaturalised productions in their new homes.\\n\\nin a state of nature almost every plant produces seed, and amongst animals\\nthere are very few which do not annually pair. hence we may confidently\\nassert, that all plants and animals are tending to increase at a\\ngeometrical ratio, that all would most rapidly stock every station in which\\nthey could any how exist, and that the geometrical tendency to increase\\nmust be checked by destruction at some period of life. our familiarity with\\nthe larger domestic animals tends, i think, to mislead us: we see no great\\ndestruction falling on them, and we forget that thousands are annually\\nslaughtered for food, and that in a state of nature an equal number would\\nhave somehow to be disposed of.\\n\\nthe only difference between organisms which annually {66} produce eggs or\\nseeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely few, is, that the\\nslow-breeders would require a few more years to people, under favourable\\nconditions, a whole district, let it be ever so large. the condor lays a\\ncouple of eggs and the ostrich a score, and yet in the same country the\\ncondor may be the more numerous of the two: the fulmar petrel lays but one\\negg, yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird in the world. one fly\\ndeposits hundreds of eggs, and another, like the hippobosca, a single one;\\nbut this difference does not determine how many individuals of the two\\nspecies can be supported in a district. a large number of eggs is of some\\nimportance to those species which depend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of\\nfood, for it allows them rapidly to increase in number. but the real\\nimportance of a large number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much\\ndestruction at some period of life; and this period in the great majority\\nof cases is an early one. if an animal can in any way protect its own eggs\\nor young, a small number may be produced, and yet the average stock be\\nfully kept up; but if many eggs or young are destroyed, many must be\\nproduced, or the species will become extinct. it would suffice to keep up\\nthe full number of a tree, which lived on an average for a thousand years,\\nif a single seed were produced once in a thousand years, supposing that\\nthis seed were never destroyed, and could be ensured to germinate in a\\nfitting place. so that in all cases, the average number of any animal or\\nplant depends only indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds.\\n\\nin looking at nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing\\nconsiderations always in mind--never to forget that every single organic\\nbeing around us may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in\\nnumbers; that each lives by a struggle at some period of {67} its life;\\nthat heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old, during\\neach generation or at recurrent intervals. lighten any check, mitigate the\\ndestruction ever so little, and the number of the species will almost\\ninstantaneously increase to any amount.\\n\\nthe causes which check the natural tendency of each species to increase in\\nnumber are most obscure. look at the most vigorous species; by as much as\\nit swarms in numbers, by so much will its tendency to increase be still\\nfurther increased. we know not exactly what the checks are in even one\\nsingle instance. nor will this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant\\nwe are on this head, even in regard to mankind, so incomparably better\\nknown than any other animal. this subject has been ably treated by several\\nauthors, and i shall, in my future work, discuss some of the checks at\\nconsiderable length, more especially in regard to the feral animals of\\nsouth america. here i will make only a few remarks, just to recall to the\\nreader\\'s mind some of the chief points. eggs or very young animals seem\\ngenerally to suffer most, but this is not invariably the case. with plants\\nthere is a vast destruction of seeds, but, from some observations which i\\nhave made, i believe that it is the seedlings which suffer most from\\ngerminating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants. seedlings,\\nalso, are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies; for instance, on a\\npiece of ground three feet long and two wide, dug and cleared, and where\\nthere could be no choking from other plants, i marked all the seedlings of\\nour native weeds as they came up, and out of the 357 no less than 295 were\\ndestroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects. if turf which has long been mown,\\nand the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds, be\\nlet to grow, the more vigorous plants {68} gradually kill the less\\nvigorous, though fully grown, plants: thus out of twenty species growing on\\na little plot of turf (three feet by four) nine species perished from the\\nother species being allowed to grow up freely.\\n\\nthe amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme limit to\\nwhich each can increase; but very frequently it is not the obtaining food,\\nbut the serving as prey to other animals, which determines the average\\nnumbers of a species. thus, there seems to be little doubt that the stock\\nof partridges, grouse, and hares on any large estate depends chiefly on the\\ndestruction of vermin. if not one head of game were shot during the next\\ntwenty years in england, and, at the same time, if no vermin were\\ndestroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game than at present,\\nalthough hundreds of thousands of game animals are now annually killed. on\\nthe other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant and rhinoceros, none\\nare destroyed by beasts of prey: even the tiger in india most rarely dares\\nto attack a young elephant protected by its dam.\\n\\nclimate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a\\nspecies, and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought, i believe to be\\nthe most effective of all checks. i estimated that the winter of 1854-55\\ndestroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds; and this is a\\ntremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent, is an\\nextraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man. the action of\\nclimate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for\\nexistence; but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it\\nbrings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of the\\nsame or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food. even\\nwhen climate, for instance extreme cold, {69} acts directly, it will be the\\nleast vigorous, or those which have got least food through the advancing\\nwinter, which will suffer most. when we travel from south to north, or from\\na damp region to a dry, we invariably see some species gradually getting\\nrarer and rarer, and finally disappearing; and the change of climate being\\nconspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct\\naction. but this is a false view: we forget that each species, even where\\nit most abounds, is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some\\nperiod of its life, from enemies or from competitors for the same place and\\nfood; and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured\\nby any slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers, and, as\\neach area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species will\\ndecrease. when we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers,\\nwe may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being\\nfavoured, as in this one being hurt. so it is when we travel northward, but\\nin a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of species of all kinds, and\\ntherefore of competitors, decreases northwards; hence in going northward,\\nor in ascending a mountain, we far oftener meet with stunted forms, due to\\nthe _directly_ injurious action of climate, than we do in proceeding\\nsouthwards or in descending a mountain. when we reach the arctic regions,\\nor snow-capped summits, or absolute deserts, the struggle for life is\\nalmost exclusively with the elements.\\n\\nthat climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species, we\\nmay clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our gardens which can\\nperfectly well endure our climate, but which never become naturalised, for\\nthey cannot compete with our native plants nor resist destruction by our\\nnative animals. {70}\\n\\nwhen a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases\\ninordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics--at least, this seems\\ngenerally to occur with our game animals--often ensue: and here we have a\\nlimiting check independent of the struggle for life. but even some of these\\nso-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms, which have from\\nsome cause, possibly in part through facility of diffusion amongst the\\ncrowded animals, been disproportionably favoured: and here comes in a sort\\nof struggle between the parasite and its prey.\\n\\non the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of the same\\nspecies, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is absolutely necessary\\nfor its preservation. thus we can easily raise plenty of corn and\\nrape-seed, &c., in our fields, because the seeds are in great excess\\ncompared with the number of birds which feed on them; nor can the birds,\\nthough having a superabundance of food at this one season, increase in\\nnumber proportionally to the supply of seed, as their numbers are checked\\nduring winter: but any one who has tried, knows how troublesome it is to\\nget seed from a few wheat or other such plants in a garden: i have in this\\ncase lost every single seed. this view of the necessity of a large stock of\\nthe same species for its preservation, explains, i believe, some singular\\nfacts in nature, such as that of very rare plants being sometimes extremely\\nabundant in the few spots where they do occur; and that of some social\\nplants being social, that is, abounding in individuals, even on the extreme\\nconfines of their range. for in such cases, we may believe, that a plant\\ncould exist only where the conditions of its life were so favourable that\\nmany could exist together, and thus save the species from utter\\ndestruction. i should add that the good effects of frequent intercrossing,\\nand {71} the ill effects of close interbreeding, probably come into play in\\nsome of these cases; but on this intricate subject i will not here enlarge.\\n\\nmany cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the checks\\nand relations between organic beings, which have to struggle together in\\nthe same country. i will give only a single instance, which, though a\\nsimple one, has interested me. in staffordshire, on the estate of a\\nrelation, where i had ample means of investigation, there was a large and\\nextremely barren heath, which had never been touched by the hand of man;\\nbut several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been enclosed\\ntwenty-five years previously and planted with scotch fir. the change in the\\nnative vegetation of the planted part of the heath was most remarkable,\\nmore than is generally seen in passing from one quite different soil to\\nanother: not only the proportional numbers of the heath-plants were wholly\\nchanged, but twelve species of plants (not counting grasses and carices)\\nflourished in the plantations, which could not be found on the heath. the\\neffect on the insects must have been still greater, for six insectivorous\\nbirds were very common in the plantations, which were not to be seen on the\\nheath; and the heath was frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous\\nbirds. here we see how potent has been the effect of the introduction of a\\nsingle tree, nothing whatever else having been done, with the exception\\nthat the land had been enclosed, so that cattle could not enter. but how\\nimportant an element enclosure is, i plainly saw near farnham, in surrey.\\nhere there are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old scotch firs on\\nthe distant hill-tops: within the last ten years large spaces have been\\nenclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so close\\ntogether that all cannot live. {72} when i ascertained that these young\\ntrees had not been sown or planted, i was so much surprised at their\\nnumbers that i went to several points of view, whence i could examine\\nhundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and literally i could not see a\\nsingle scotch fir, except the old planted clumps. but on looking closely\\nbetween the stems of the heath, i found a multitude of seedlings and little\\ntrees, which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle. in one square\\nyard, at a point some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps, i\\ncounted thirty-two little trees; and one of them, with twenty-six rings of\\ngrowth, had during many years tried to raise its head above the stems of\\nthe heath, and had failed. no wonder that, as soon as the land was\\nenclosed, it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs. yet\\nthe heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever\\nhave imagined that cattle would have so closely and effectually searched it\\nfor food.\\n\\nhere we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the scotch\\nfir; but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence of\\ncattle. perhaps paraguay offers the most curious instance of this; for here\\nneither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though they swarm\\nsouthward and northward in a feral state; and azara and rengger have shown\\nthat this is caused by the greater number in paraguay of a certain fly,\\nwhich lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born. the\\nincrease of these flies, numerous as they are, must be habitually checked\\nby some means, probably by birds. hence, if certain insectivorous birds\\n(whose numbers are probably regulated by hawks or beasts of prey) were to\\nincrease in paraguay, the flies would decrease--then cattle and horses\\nwould became feral, and this would certainly greatly {73} alter (as indeed\\ni have observed in parts of south america) the vegetation: this again would\\nlargely affect the insects; and this, as we just have seen in\\nstaffordshire, the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in ever-increasing\\ncircles of complexity. we began this series by insectivorous birds, and we\\nhave ended with them, not that in nature the relations can ever be as\\nsimple as this. battle within battle must ever be recurring with varying\\nsuccess; and yet in the long-run the forces are so nicely balanced, that\\nthe face of nature remains uniform for long periods of time, though\\nassuredly the merest trifle would often give the victory to one organic\\nbeing over another. nevertheless so profound is our ignorance, and so high\\nour presumption, that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an\\norganic being; and as we do not see the cause, we invoke cataclysms to\\ndesolate the world, or invent laws on the duration of the forms of life!\\n\\ni am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals, most\\nremote in the scale of nature, are bound together by a web of complex\\nrelations. i shall hereafter have occasion to show that the exotic lobelia\\nfulgens, in this part of england, is never visited by insects, and\\nconsequently, from its peculiar structure, never can set a seed. many of\\nour orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove\\ntheir pollen-masses and thus to fertilise them. i have, also, reason to\\nbelieve that humble-bees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the\\nheartsease (viola tricolor), for other bees do not visit this flower. from\\nexperiments which i have lately tried, i have found that the visits of bees\\nare necessary for the fertilisation of some kinds of clover; but\\nhumble-bees alone visit the red clover (trifolium pratense), as other bees\\ncannot reach the nectar. hence i have very little doubt, that if the {74}\\nwhole genus of humble-bees became extinct or very rare in england, the\\nheartsease and red clover would become very rare, or wholly disappear. the\\nnumber of humble-bees in any district depends in a great degree on the\\nnumber of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests; and mr. h.\\nnewman, who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes that\\n\"more than two-thirds of them are thus destroyed all over england.\" now the\\nnumber of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on the number of\\ncats; and mr. newman says, \"near villages and small towns i have found the\\nnests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which i attribute to the\\nnumber of cats that destroy the mice.\" hence it is quite credible that the\\npresence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine,\\nthrough the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of\\ncertain flowers in that district!\\n\\nin the case of every species, many different checks, acting at different\\nperiods of life, and during different seasons or years, probably come into\\nplay; some one check or some few being generally the most potent, but all\\nconcur in determining the average number or even the existence of the\\nspecies. in some cases it can be shown that widely-different checks act on\\nthe same species in different districts. when we look at the plants and\\nbushes clothing an entangled bank, we are tempted to attribute their\\nproportional numbers and kinds to what we call chance. but how false a view\\nis this! every one has heard that when an american forest is cut down, a\\nvery different vegetation springs up; but it has been observed that ancient\\nindian ruins in the southern united states, which must formerly have been\\ncleared of trees, now display the same beautiful diversity and proportion\\nof kinds as in the surrounding {75} virgin forests. what a struggle between\\nthe several kinds of trees must here have gone on during long centuries,\\neach annually scattering its seeds by the thousand; what war between insect\\nand insect--between insects, snails, and other animals with birds and\\nbeasts of prey--all striving to increase, and all feeding on each other or\\non the trees or their seeds and seedlings, or on the other plants which\\nfirst clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees! throw up\\na handful of feathers, and all must fall to the ground according to\\ndefinite laws; but how simple is this problem compared to the action and\\nreaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined, in\\nthe course of centuries, the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now\\ngrowing on the old indian ruins!\\n\\nthe dependency of one organic being on another, as of a parasite on its\\nprey, lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature. this is\\noften the case with those which may strictly be said to struggle with each\\nother for existence, as in the case of locusts and grass-feeding\\nquadrupeds. but the struggle almost invariably will be most severe between\\nthe individuals of the same species, for they frequent the same districts,\\nrequire the same food, and are exposed to the same dangers. in the case of\\nvarieties of the same species, the struggle will generally be almost\\nequally severe, and we sometimes see the contest soon decided; for\\ninstance, if several varieties of wheat be sown together, and the mixed\\nseed be resown, some of the varieties which best suit the soil or climate,\\nor are naturally the most fertile, will beat the others and so yield more\\nseed, and will consequently in a few years quite supplant the other\\nvarieties. to keep up a mixed stock of even such extremely close varieties\\nas the variously {76} coloured sweet-peas, they must be each year harvested\\nseparately, and the seed then mixed in due proportion, otherwise the weaker\\nkinds will steadily decrease in numbers and disappear. so again with the\\nvarieties of sheep: it has been asserted that certain mountain-varieties\\nwill starve out other mountain-varieties, so that they cannot be kept\\ntogether. the same result has followed from keeping together different\\nvarieties of the medicinal leech. it may even be doubted whether the\\nvarieties of any one of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the\\nsame strength, habits, and constitution, that the original proportions of a\\nmixed stock could be kept up for half-a-dozen generations, if they were\\nallowed to struggle together, like beings in a state of nature, and if the\\nseed or young were not annually sorted.\\n\\nas species of the same genus have usually, though by no means invariably,\\nsome similarity in habits and constitution, and always in structure, the\\nstruggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus,\\nwhen they come into competition with each other, than between species of\\ndistinct genera. we see this in the recent extension over parts of the\\nunited states of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of\\nanother species. the recent increase of the missel-thrush in parts of\\nscotland has caused the decrease of the song-thrush. how frequently we hear\\nof one species of rat taking the place of another species under the most\\ndifferent climates! in russia the small asiatic cockroach has everywhere\\ndriven before it its great congener. one species of charlock will supplant\\nanother, and so in other cases. we can dimly see why the competition should\\nbe most severe between allied forms, which fill nearly the same place in\\nthe economy of nature; {77} but probably in no one case could we precisely\\nsay why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle of\\nlife.\\n\\na corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing\\nremarks, namely, that the structure of every organic being is related, in\\nthe most essential yet often hidden manner, to that of all other organic\\nbeings, with which it comes into competition for food or residence, or from\\nwhich it has to escape, or on which it preys. this is obvious in the\\nstructure of the teeth and talons of the tiger; and in that of the legs and\\nclaws of the parasite which clings to the hair on the tiger\\'s body. but in\\nthe beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion, and in the flattened and\\nfringed legs of the water-beetle, the relation seems at first confined to\\nthe elements of air and water. yet the advantage of plumed seeds no doubt\\nstands in the closest relation to the land being already thickly clothed by\\nother plants; so that the seeds may be widely distributed and fall on\\nunoccupied ground. in the water-beetle, the structure of its legs, so well\\nadapted for diving, allows it to compete with other aquatic insects, to\\nhunt for its own prey, and to escape serving as prey to other animals.\\n\\nthe store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at\\nfirst sight to have no sort of relation to other plants. but from the\\nstrong growth of young plants produced from such seeds (as peas and beans),\\nwhen sown in the midst of long grass, i suspect that the chief use of the\\nnutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the young seedling, whilst\\nstruggling with other plants growing vigorously all around.\\n\\nlook at a plant in the midst of its range, why does it not double or\\nquadruple its numbers? we know {78} that it can perfectly well withstand a\\nlittle more heat or cold, dampness or dryness, for elsewhere it ranges into\\nslightly hotter or colder, damper or drier districts. in this case we can\\nclearly see that if we wished in imagination to give the plant the power of\\nincreasing in number, we should have to give it some advantage over its\\ncompetitors, or over the animals which preyed on it. on the confines of its\\ngeographical range, a change of constitution with respect to climate would\\nclearly be an advantage to our plant; but we have reason to believe that\\nonly a few plants or animals range so far, that they are destroyed by the\\nrigour of the climate alone. not until we reach the extreme confines of\\nlife, in the arctic regions or on the borders of an utter desert, will\\ncompetition cease. the land may be extremely cold or dry, yet there will be\\ncompetition between some few species, or between the individuals of the\\nsame species, for the warmest or dampest spots.\\n\\nhence, also, we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new\\ncountry amongst new competitors, though the climate may be exactly the same\\nas in its former home, yet the conditions of its life will generally be\\nchanged in an essential manner. if we wished to increase its average\\nnumbers in its new home, we should have to modify it in a different way to\\nwhat we should have done in its native country; for we should have to give\\nit some advantage over a different set of competitors or enemies.\\n\\nit is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form some advantage\\nover another. probably in no single instance should we know what to do, so\\nas to succeed. it will convince us of our ignorance on the mutual relations\\nof all organic beings; a conviction as necessary, as it seems to be\\ndifficult to acquire. all that we can do, is to keep steadily in mind that\\neach {79} organic being is striving to increase at a geometrical ratio;\\nthat each at some period of its life, during some season of the year,\\nduring each generation or at intervals, has to struggle for life, and to\\nsuffer great destruction. when we reflect on this struggle, we may console\\nourselves with the full belief, that the war of nature is not incessant,\\nthat no fear is felt, that death is generally prompt, and that the\\nvigorous, the healthy, and the happy survive and multiply.\\n\\n       *       *       *

at all ages and on both\\n    sexes--sexual selection--on the generality of intercrosses between\\n    individuals of the same species--circumstances favourable and\\n    unfavourable to natural

grouping of all organic\\n    beings.\\n\\nhow will the struggle for existence, discussed too briefly in the last\\nchapter, act in regard to variation? can the principle of selection, which\\nwe have seen is so potent in the hands of man, apply in nature? i think we\\nshall see that it can act most effectually. let it be borne in mind in what\\nan endless number of strange peculiarities our domestic productions, and,\\nin a lesser degree, those under nature, vary; and how strong the hereditary\\ntendency is. under domestication, it may be truly said that the whole\\norganisation becomes in some degree plastic. let it be borne in mind how\\ninfinitely complex and close-fitting are the mutual relations of all\\norganic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life. can\\nit, then, be thought improbable, seeing that variations useful to man have\\nundoubtedly occurred, that other variations useful in some way to each\\nbeing in the great and complex battle of life, should sometimes occur in\\nthe course of thousands of generations? if such do occur, can we doubt {81}\\n(remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive)\\nthat individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would\\nhave the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind? on the\\nother hand, we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree\\ninjurious would be rigidly destroyed. this preservation of favourable\\nvariations and the rejection of injurious variations, i call natural\\nselection. variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by\\nnatural selection, and would be left a fluctuating element, as perhaps we\\nsee in the species called polymorphic.\\n\\nwe shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking\\nthe case of a country undergoing some physical change, for instance, of\\nclimate. the proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost\\nimmediately undergo a change, and some species might become extinct. we may\\nconclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in\\nwhich the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that any change\\nin the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants, independently of\\nthe change of climate itself, would seriously affect many of the others. if\\nthe country were open on its borders, new forms would certainly immigrate,\\nand this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former\\ninhabitants. let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single\\nintroduced tree or mammal has been shown to be. but in the case of an\\nisland, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into which new and\\nbetter adapted forms could not freely enter, we should then have places in\\nthe economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up, if some of\\nthe original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the area\\nbeen open to immigration, these same {82} places would have been seized on\\nby intruders. in such case, every slight modification, which in the course\\nof ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of\\nany of the species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions,\\nwould tend to be preserved; and natural selection would thus have free\\nscope for the work of improvement.\\n\\nwe have reason to believe, as stated in the first chapter, that a change in\\nthe conditions of life, by specially acting on the reproductive system,\\ncauses or increases variability; and in the foregoing case the conditions\\nof life are supposed to have undergone a change, and this would manifestly\\nbe favourable to natural selection, by giving a better chance of profitable\\nvariations occurring; and unless profitable variations do occur, natural\\nselection can do nothing. not that, as i believe, any extreme amount of\\nvariability is necessary; as man can certainly produce great results by\\nadding up in any given direction mere individual differences, so could\\nnature, but far more easily, from having incomparably longer time at her\\ndisposal. nor do i believe that any great physical change, as of climate,\\nor any unusual degree of isolation to check immigration, is actually\\nnecessary to produce new and unoccupied places for natural selection to\\nfill up by modifying and improving some of the varying inhabitants. for as\\nall the inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely\\nbalanced forces, extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits\\nof one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others; and still\\nfurther modifications of the same kind would often still further increase\\nthe advantage. no country can be named in which all the native inhabitants\\nare now so perfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions\\nunder which they live, that none of {83} them could anyhow be improved; for\\nin all countries, the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised\\nproductions, that they have allowed foreigners to take firm possession of\\nthe land. and as foreigners have thus everywhere beaten some of the\\nnatives, we may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified\\nwith advantage, so as to have better resisted such intruders.\\n\\nas man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his\\nmethodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not nature effect?\\nman can act only on external and visible characters: nature cares nothing\\nfor appearances, except in so far as they may be useful to any being. she\\ncan act on every internal organ, on every shade of constitutional\\ndifference, on the whole machinery of life. man selects only for his own\\ngood; nature only for that of the being which she tends. every selected\\ncharacter is fully exercised by her; and the being is placed under\\nwell-suited conditions of life. man keeps the natives of many climates in\\nthe same country; he seldom exercises each selected character in some\\npeculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on\\nthe same food; he does not exercise a long-backed or long-legged quadruped\\nin any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the\\nsame climate. he does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the\\nfemales. he does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals, but protects\\nduring each varying season, as far as lies in his power, all his\\nproductions. he often begins his selection by some half-monstrous form; or\\nat least by some modification prominent enough to catch his eye, or to be\\nplainly useful to him. under nature, the slightest difference of structure\\nor constitution may well turn the nicely-balanced scale in the struggle for\\nlife, and so be {84} preserved. how fleeting are the wishes and efforts of\\nman! how short his time! and consequently how poor will his products be,\\ncompared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods.\\ncan we wonder, then, that nature\\'s productions should be far \"truer\" in\\ncharacter than man\\'s productions; that they should be infinitely better\\nadapted to the most complex conditions of life, and should plainly bear the\\nstamp of far higher workmanship?\\n\\nit may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily and hourly\\nscrutinising, throughout the world, every variation, even the slightest;\\nrejecting that which is bad, preserving and adding up all that is good;\\nsilently and insensibly working, whenever and wherever opportunity offers,\\nat the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and\\ninorganic conditions of life. we see nothing of these slow changes in\\nprogress, until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages, and\\nthen so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages, that we only\\nsee that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were.\\n\\nalthough natural selection can act only through and for the good of each\\nbeing, yet characters and structures, which we are apt to consider as of\\nvery trifling importance, may thus be acted on. when we see leaf-eating\\ninsects green, and bark-feeders mottled-grey; the alpine ptarmigan white in\\nwinter, the red-grouse the colour of heather, and the black-grouse that of\\npeaty earth, we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds\\nand insects in preserving them from danger. grouse, if not destroyed at\\nsome period of their lives, would increase in countless numbers; they are\\nknown to suffer largely from birds of prey; and hawks are guided by\\neyesight to their prey--so much so, that on {85} parts of the continent\\npersons are warned not to keep white pigeons, as being the most liable to\\ndestruction. hence i can see no reason to doubt that natural selection\\nmight be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse,\\nand in keeping that colour, when once acquired, true and constant. nor\\nought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any\\nparticular colour would produce little effect: we should remember how\\nessential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy every lamb with the\\nfaintest trace of black. in plants the down on the fruit and the colour of\\nthe flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling\\nimportance: yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist, downing, that in\\nthe united states smooth-skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle, a\\ncurculio, than those with down; that purple plums suffer far more from a\\ncertain disease than yellow plums; whereas another disease attacks\\nyellow-fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh. if,\\nwith all the aids of art, these slight differences make a great difference\\nin cultivating the several varieties, assuredly, in a state of nature,\\nwhere the trees would have to struggle with other trees and with a host of\\nenemies, such differences would effectually settle which variety, whether a\\nsmooth or downy, a yellow or purple fleshed fruit, should succeed.\\n\\nin looking at many small points of difference between species, which, as\\nfar as our ignorance permits us to judge, seem quite unimportant, we must\\nnot forget that climate, food, &c., probably produce some slight and direct\\neffect. it is, however, far more necessary to bear in mind that there are\\nmany unknown laws of correlation of growth, which, when one part of the\\norganisation is modified through variation, and the modifications are\\naccumulated by natural selection for {86} the good of the being, will cause\\nother modifications, often of the most unexpected nature.\\n\\nas we see that those variations which under domestication appear at any\\nparticular period of life, tend to reappear in the offspring at the same\\nperiod;--for instance, in the seeds of the many varieties of our culinary\\nand agricultural plants; in the caterpillar and cocoon stages of the\\nvarieties of the silkworm; in the eggs of poultry, and in the colour of the\\ndown of their chickens; in the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly\\nadult;--so in a state of nature, natural selection will be enabled to act\\non and modify organic beings at any age, by the accumulation of variations\\nprofitable at that age, and by their inheritance at a corresponding age. if\\nit profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by\\nthe wind, i can see no greater difficulty in this being effected through\\nnatural selection, than in the cotton-planter increasing and improving by\\nselection the down in the pods on his cotton-trees. natural selection may\\nmodify and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies, wholly\\ndifferent from those which concern the mature insect. these modifications\\nwill no doubt affect, through the laws of correlation, the structure of the\\nadult; and probably in the case of those insects which live only for a few\\nhours, and which never feed, a large part of their structure is merely the\\ncorrelated result of successive changes in the structure of their larvг¦.\\nso, conversely, modifications in the adult will probably often affect the\\nstructure of the larva; but in all cases natural selection will ensure that\\nmodifications consequent on other modifications at a different period of\\nlife, shall not be in the least degree injurious: for if they became so,\\nthey would cause the extinction of the species.\\n\\nnatural selection will modify the structure of the {87} young in relation\\nto the parent, and of the parent in relation to the young. in social\\nanimals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of\\nthe community; if each in consequence profits by the selected change. what\\nnatural selection cannot do, is to modify the structure of one species,\\nwithout giving it any advantage, for the good of another species; and\\nthough statements to this effect may be found in works of natural history,\\ni cannot find one case which will bear investigation. a structure used only\\nonce in an animal\\'s whole life, if of high importance to it, might be\\nmodified to any extent by natural selection; for instance, the great jaws\\npossessed by certain insects, used exclusively for opening the cocoon--or\\nthe hard tip to the beak of nestling birds, used for breaking the egg. it\\nhas been asserted, that of the best short-beaked tumbler-pigeons more\\nperish in the egg than are able to get out of it; so that fanciers assist\\nin the act of hatching. now, if nature had to make the beak of a full-grown\\npigeon very short for the bird\\'s own advantage, the process of modification\\nwould be very slow, and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous\\nselection of the young birds within the egg, which had the most powerful\\nand hardest beaks, for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish: or,\\nmore delicate and more easily broken shells might be selected, the\\nthickness of the shell being known to vary like every other structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n_sexual selection._--inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under\\ndomestication in one sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex, the\\nsame fact probably occurs under nature, and if so, natural selection will\\nbe able to modify one sex in its functional relations to the other sex, or\\nin relation to wholly different habits of life in the two sexes, as is\\nsometimes the case {88} with insects. and this leads me to say a few words\\non what i call sexual selection. this depends, not on a struggle for\\nexistence, but on a struggle between the males for possession of the\\nfemales; the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor, but few or\\nno offspring. sexual selection is, therefore, less rigorous than natural\\nselection. generally, the most vigorous males, those which are best fitted\\nfor their places in nature, will leave most progeny. but in many cases,\\nvictory depends not on general vigour, but on having special weapons,\\nconfined to the male sex. a hornless stag or spurless cock would have a\\npoor chance of leaving offspring. sexual selection by always allowing the\\nvictor to breed might surely give indomitable courage, length to the spur,\\nand strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg, as well as the\\nbrutal cock-fighter, who knows well that he can improve his breed by\\ncareful selection of the best cocks. how low in the scale of nature the law\\nof battle descends, i know not; male alligators have been described as\\nfighting, bellowing, and whirling round, like indians in a war-dance, for\\nthe possession of the females; male salmons have been seen fighting all day\\nlong; male stag-beetles often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other\\nmales. the war is, perhaps, severest between the males of polygamous\\nanimals, and these seem oftenest provided with special weapons. the males\\nof carnivorous animals are already well armed; though to them and to\\nothers, special means of defence may be given through means of sexual\\nselection, as the mane to the lion, the shoulder-pad to the boar, and the\\nhooked jaw to the male salmon; for the shield may be as important for\\nvictory, as the sword or spear.\\n\\namongst birds, the contest is often of a more peaceful character. all those\\nwho have attended to the subject, {89} believe that there is the severest\\nrivalry between the males of many species to attract by singing the\\nfemales. the rock-thrush of guiana, birds of paradise, and some others,\\ncongregate; and successive males display their gorgeous plumage and perform\\nstrange antics before the females, which, standing by as spectators, at\\nlast choose the most attractive partner. those who have closely attended to\\nbirds in confinement well know that they often take individual preferences\\nand dislikes: thus sir r. heron has described how one pied peacock was\\neminently attractive to all his hen birds. it may appear childish to\\nattribute any effect to such apparently weak means: i cannot here enter on\\nthe details necessary to support this view; but if man can in a short time\\ngive elegant carriage and beauty to his bantams, according to his standard\\nof beauty, i can see no good reason to doubt that female birds, by\\nselecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious or beautiful\\nmales, according to their standard of beauty, might produce a marked\\neffect. i strongly suspect that some well-known laws, with respect to the\\nplumage of male and female birds, in comparison with the plumage of the\\nyoung, can be explained on the view of plumage having been chiefly modified\\nby sexual selection, acting when the birds have come to the breeding age or\\nduring the breeding season; the modifications thus produced being inherited\\nat corresponding ages or seasons, either by the males alone, or by the\\nmales and females; but i have not space here to enter on this subject.\\n\\nthus it is, as i believe, that when the males and females of any animal\\nhave the same general habits of life, but differ in structure, colour, or\\nornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection;\\nthat is, individual males have had, in successive generations, some slight\\nadvantage over other {90} males, in their weapons, means of defence, or\\ncharms; and have transmitted these advantages to their male offspring. yet,\\ni would not wish to attribute all such sexual differences to this agency:\\nfor we see peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex in\\nour domestic animals (as the wattle in male carriers, horn-like\\nprotuberances in the cocks of certain fowls, &c.), which we cannot believe\\nto be either useful to the males in battle, or attractive to the females.\\nwe see analogous cases under nature, for instance, the tuft of hair on the\\nbreast of the turkey-cock, which can hardly be either useful or ornamental\\nto this bird;--indeed, had the tuft appeared under domestication, it would\\nhave been called a monstrosity.\\n\\n\\n\\n_illustrations of the action of natural selection._--in order to make it\\nclear how, as i believe, natural selection acts, i must beg permission to\\ngive one or two imaginary illustrations. let us take the case of a wolf,\\nwhich preys on various animals, securing some by craft, some by strength,\\nand some by fleetness; and let us suppose that the fleetest prey, a deer\\nfor instance, had from any change in the country increased in numbers, or\\nthat other prey had decreased in numbers, during that season of the year\\nwhen the wolf is hardest pressed for food. i can under such circumstances\\nsee no reason to doubt that the swiftest and slimmest wolves would have the\\nbest chance of surviving, and so be preserved or selected,--provided always\\nthat they retained strength to master their prey at this or at some other\\nperiod of the year, when they might be compelled to prey on other animals.\\ni can see no more reason to doubt this, than that man can improve the\\nfleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection, or by that\\nunconscious selection which results from each man trying {91} to keep the\\nbest dogs without any thought of modifying the breed.\\n\\neven without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on which\\nour wolf preyed, a cub might be born with an innate tendency to pursue\\ncertain kinds of prey. nor can this be thought very improbable; for we\\noften observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our domestic\\nanimals; one cat, for instance, taking to catch rats, another mice; one\\ncat, according to mr. st. john, bringing home winged game, another hares or\\nrabbits, and another hunting on marshy ground and almost nightly catching\\nwoodcocks or snipes. the tendency to catch rats rather than mice is known\\nto be inherited. now, if any slight innate change of habit or of structure\\nbenefited an individual wolf, it would have the best chance of surviving\\nand of leaving offspring. some of its young would probably inherit the same\\nhabits or structure, and by the repetition of this process, a new variety\\nmight be formed which would either supplant or coexist with the parent form\\nof wolf. or, again, the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district, and those\\nfrequenting the lowlands, would naturally be forced to hunt different prey;\\nand from the continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the\\ntwo sites, two varieties might slowly be formed. these varieties would\\ncross and blend where they met; but to this subject of intercrossing we\\nshall soon have to return. i may add, that, according to mr. pierce, there\\nare two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the catskill mountains in the\\nunited states, one with a light greyhound-like form, which pursues deer,\\nand the other more bulky, with shorter legs, which more frequently attacks\\nthe shepherd\\'s flocks.\\n\\nlet us now take a more complex case. certain plants excrete a sweet juice,\\napparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from their sap:\\nthis is {92} effected by glands at the base of the stipules in some\\nleguminosг¦, and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel. this juice,\\nthough small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects. let us now suppose\\na little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by the inner bases of the\\npetals of a flower. in this case insects in seeking the nectar would get\\ndusted with pollen, and would certainly often transport the pollen from one\\nflower to the stigma of another flower. the flowers of two distinct\\nindividuals of the same species would thus get crossed; and the act of\\ncrossing, we have good reason to believe (as will hereafter be more fully\\nalluded to), would produce very vigorous seedlings, which consequently\\nwould have the best chance of flourishing and surviving. some of these\\nseedlings would probably inherit the nectar-excreting power. those\\nindividual flowers which had the largest glands or nectaries, and which\\nexcreted most nectar, would be oftenest visited by insects, and would be\\noftenest crossed; and so in the long-run would gain the upper hand. those\\nflowers, also, which had their stamens and pistils placed, in relation to\\nthe size and habits of the particular insects which visited them, so as to\\nfavour in any degree the transportal of their pollen from flower to flower,\\nwould likewise be favoured or selected. we might have taken the case of\\ninsects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of\\nnectar; and as pollen is formed for the sole object of fertilisation, its\\ndestruction appears a simple loss to the plant; yet if a little pollen were\\ncarried, at first occasionally and then habitually, by the pollen-devouring\\ninsects from flower to flower, and a cross thus effected, although\\nnine-tenths of the pollen were destroyed, it might still be a great gain to\\nthe plant; and those individuals which produced more and more pollen, and\\nhad larger and larger anthers, would be selected. {93}\\n\\nwhen our plant, by this process of the continued preservation or natural\\nselection of more and more attractive flowers, had been rendered highly\\nattractive to insects, they would, unintentionally on their part, regularly\\ncarry pollen from flower to flower; and that they can most effectually do\\nthis, i could easily show by many striking instances. i will give only\\none--not as a very striking case, but as likewise illustrating one step in\\nthe separation of the sexes of plants, presently to be alluded to. some\\nholly-trees bear only male flowers, which have four stamens producing a\\nrather small quantity of pollen, and a rudimentary pistil; other\\nholly-trees bear only female flowers; these have a full-sized pistil, and\\nfour stamens with shrivelled anthers, in which not a grain of pollen can be\\ndetected. having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a male tree,\\ni put the stigmas of twenty flowers, taken from different branches, under\\nthe microscope, and on all, without exception, there were pollen-grains,\\nand on some a profusion of pollen. as the wind had set for several days\\nfrom the female to the male tree, the pollen could not thus have been\\ncarried. the weather had been cold and boisterous, and therefore not\\nfavourable to bees, nevertheless every female flower which i examined had\\nbeen effectually fertilised by the bees, accidentally dusted with pollen,\\nhaving flown from tree to tree in search of nectar. but to return to our\\nimaginary case: as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive\\nto insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower, another\\nprocess might commence. no naturalist doubts the advantage of what has been\\ncalled the \"physiological division of labour;\" hence we may believe that it\\nwould be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one flower or\\non one whole plant, and pistils alone in {94} another flower or on another\\nplant. in plants under culture and placed under new conditions of life,\\nsometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs become more or\\nless impotent; now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree\\nunder nature, then as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to\\nflower, and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would\\nbe advantageous on the principle of the division of labour, individuals\\nwith this tendency more and more increased, would be continually favoured\\nor selected, until at last a complete separation of the sexes would be\\neffected.\\n\\nlet us now turn to the nectar-feeding insects in our imaginary case: we may\\nsuppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by\\ncontinued selection, to be a common plant; and that certain insects\\ndepended in main part on its nectar for food. i could give many facts,\\nshowing how anxious bees are to save time; for instance, their habit of\\ncutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers, which\\nthey can, with a very little more trouble, enter by the mouth. bearing such\\nfacts in mind, i can see no reason to doubt that an accidental deviation in\\nthe size and form of the body, or in the curvature and length of the\\nproboscis, &c., far too slight to be appreciated by us, might profit a bee\\nor other insect, so that an individual so characterised would be able to\\nobtain its food more quickly, and so have a better chance of living and\\nleaving descendants. its descendants would probably inherit a tendency to a\\nsimilar slight deviation of structure. the tubes of the corollas of the\\ncommon red and incarnate clovers (trifolium pratense and incarnatum) do not\\non a hasty glance appear to differ in length; yet the hive-bee can easily\\nsuck the nectar out of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red\\n{95} clover, which is visited by humble-bees alone; so that whole fields of\\nthe red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the\\nhive-bee. thus it might be a great advantage to the hive-bee to have a\\nslightly longer or differently constructed proboscis. on the other hand, i\\nhave found by experiment that the fertility of clover depends on bees\\nvisiting and moving parts of the corolla, so as to push the pollen on to\\nthe stigmatic surface. hence, again, if humble-bees were to become rare in\\nany country, it might be a great advantage to the red clover to have a\\nshorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla, so that the hive-bee\\ncould visit its flowers. thus i can understand how a flower and a bee might\\nslowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and\\nadapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued\\npreservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable\\ndeviations of structure.\\n\\ni am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in the\\nabove imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which were at\\nfirst urged against sir charles lyell\\'s noble views on \"the modern changes\\nof the earth, as illustrative of geology;\" but we now seldom hear the\\naction, for instance, of the coast-waves, called a trifling and\\ninsignificant cause, when applied to the excavation of gigantic valleys or\\nto the formation of the longest lines of inland cliffs. natural selection\\ncan act only by the preservation and accumulation of infinitesimally small\\ninherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being; and as\\nmodern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great\\nvalley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection, if it be a\\ntrue principle, banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic\\n{96} beings, or of any great and sudden modification in their structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n_on the intercrossing of individuals._--i must here introduce a short\\ndigression. in the case of animals and plants with separated sexes, it is\\nof course obvious that two individuals must always (with the exception of\\nthe curious and not well-understood cases of parthenogenesis) unite for\\neach birth; but in the case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious.\\nnevertheless i am strongly inclined to believe that with all hermaphrodites\\ntwo individuals, either occasionally or habitually, concur for the\\nreproduction of their kind. this view was first suggested by andrew knight.\\nwe shall presently see its importance; but i must here treat the subject\\nwith extreme brevity, though i have the materials prepared for an ample\\ndiscussion. all vertebrate animals, all insects, and some other large\\ngroups of animals, pair for each birth. modern research has much diminished\\nthe number of supposed hermaphrodites, and of real hermaphrodites a large\\nnumber pair; that is, two individuals regularly unite for reproduction,\\nwhich is all that concerns us. but still there are many hermaphrodite\\nanimals which certainly do not habitually pair, and a vast majority of\\nplants are hermaphrodites. what reason, it may be asked, is there for\\nsupposing in these cases that two individuals ever concur in reproduction?\\nas it is impossible here to enter on details, i must trust to some general\\nconsiderations alone.\\n\\nin the first place, i have collected so large a body of facts, showing, in\\naccordance with the almost universal belief of breeders, that with animals\\nand plants a cross between different varieties, or between individuals of\\nthe same variety but of another strain, gives vigour and {97} fertility to\\nthe offspring; and on the other hand, that _close_ interbreeding diminishes\\nvigour and fertility; that these facts alone incline me to believe that it\\nis a general law of nature (utterly ignorant though we be of the meaning of\\nthe law) that no organic being self-fertilises itself for an eternity of\\ngenerations; but that a cross with another individual is\\noccasionally--perhaps at very long intervals--indispensable.\\n\\non the belief that this is a law of nature, we can, i think, understand\\nseveral large classes of facts, such as the following, which on any other\\nview are inexplicable. every hybridizer knows how unfavourable exposure to\\nwet is to the fertilisation of a flower, yet what a multitude of flowers\\nhave their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the weather! but if an\\noccasional cross be indispensable, the fullest freedom for the entrance of\\npollen from another individual will explain this state of exposure, more\\nespecially as the plant\\'s own anthers and pistil generally stand so close\\ntogether that self-fertilisation seems almost inevitable. many flowers, on\\nthe other hand, have their organs of fructification closely enclosed, as in\\nthe great papilionaceous or pea-family; but in several, perhaps in all,\\nsuch flowers, there is a very curious adaptation between the structure of\\nthe flower and the manner in which bees suck the nectar; for, in doing\\nthis, they either push the flower\\'s own pollen on the stigma, or bring\\npollen from another flower. so necessary are the visits of bees to\\npapilionaceous flowers, that i have found, by experiments published\\nelsewhere, that their fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be\\nprevented. now, it is scarcely possible that bees should fly from flower to\\nflower, and not carry pollen from one to the other, to the great good, as i\\nbelieve, of the plant. bees will act like a camel-hair pencil, and it is\\nquite sufficient just to touch the anthers of {98} one flower and then the\\nstigma of another with the same brush to ensure fertilisation; but it must\\nnot be supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between\\ndistinct species; for if you bring on the same brush a plant\\'s own pollen\\nand pollen from another species, the former will have such a prepotent\\neffect, that it will invariably and completely destroy, as has been shown\\nby gг¤rtner, any influence from the foreign pollen.\\n\\nwhen the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil, or slowly\\nmove one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems adapted solely\\nto ensure self-fertilisation; and no doubt it is useful for this end: but,\\nthe agency of insects is often required to cause the stamens to spring\\nforward, as kг¶lreuter has shown to be the case with the barberry; and in\\nthis very genus, which seems to have a special contrivance for\\nself-fertilisation, it is well known that if closely-allied forms or\\nvarieties are planted near each other, it is hardly possible to raise pure\\nseedlings, so largely do they naturally cross. in many other cases, far\\nfrom there being any aids for self-fertilisation, there are special\\ncontrivances, as i could show from the writings of c. c. sprengel and from\\nmy own observations, which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen\\nfrom its own flower: for instance, in lobelia fulgens, there is a really\\nbeautiful and elaborate contrivance by which every one of the infinitely\\nnumerous pollen-granules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each\\nflower, before the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive\\nthem; and as this flower is never visited, at least in my garden, by\\ninsects, it never sets a seed, though by placing pollen from one flower on\\nthe stigma of another, i raised plenty of seedlings; and whilst another\\nspecies of lobelia growing close by, which is visited by bees, seeds\\nfreely. in very many other cases, though there {99} be no special\\nmechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma of a flower receiving its own\\npollen, yet, as c. c. sprengel has shown, and as i can confirm, either the\\nanthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the stigma\\nis ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that these plants\\nhave in fact separated sexes, and must habitually be crossed. how strange\\nare these facts! how strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the\\nsame flower, though placed so close together, as if for the very purpose of\\nself-fertilisation, should in so many cases be mutually useless to each\\nother! how simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional\\ncross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable!\\n\\nif several varieties of the cabbage, radish, onion, and of some other\\nplants, be allowed to seed near each other, a large majority, as i have\\nfound, of the seedlings thus raised will turn out mongrels: for instance, i\\nraised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties\\ngrowing near each other, and of these only 78 were true to their kind, and\\nsome even of these were not perfectly true. yet the pistil of each\\ncabbage-flower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens, but by those\\nof the many other flowers on the same plant. how, then, comes it that such\\na vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized? i suspect that it must\\narise from the pollen of a distinct _variety_ having a prepotent effect\\nover a flower\\'s own pollen; and that this is part of the general law of\\ngood being derived from the intercrossing of distinct individuals of the\\nsame species. when distinct _species_ are crossed the case is directly the\\nreverse, for a plant\\'s own pollen is always prepotent over foreign pollen;\\nbut to this subject we shall return in a future chapter.\\n\\nin the case of a gigantic tree covered with, {100} innumerable flowers, it\\nmay be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree, and\\nat most only from flower to flower on the same tree, and that flowers on\\nthe same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited\\nsense. i believe this objection to be valid, but that nature has largely\\nprovided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear flowers\\nwith separated sexes. when the sexes are separated, although the male and\\nfemale flowers may be produced on the same tree, we can see that pollen\\nmust be regularly carried from flower to flower; and this will give a\\nbetter chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree. that\\ntrees belonging to all orders have their sexes more often separated than\\nother plants, i find to be the case in this country; and at my request dr.\\nhooker tabulated the trees of new zealand, and dr. asa gray those of the\\nunited states, and the result was as i anticipated. on the other hand, dr.\\nhooker has recently informed me that he finds that the rule does not hold\\nin australia; and i have made these few remarks on the sexes of trees\\nsimply to call attention to the subject.\\n\\nturning for a very brief space to animals: on the land there are some\\nhermaphrodites, as land-mollusca and earth-worms; but these all pair. as\\nyet i have not found a single case of a terrestrial animal which fertilises\\nitself. we can understand this remarkable fact, which offers so strong a\\ncontrast with terrestrial plants, on the view of an occasional cross being\\nindispensable, by considering the medium in which terrestrial animals live,\\nand the nature of the fertilising element; for we know of no means,\\nanalogous to the action of insects and of the wind in the case of plants,\\nby which an occasional cross could be effected with terrestrial animals\\nwithout the concurrence of two individuals. of aquatic animals, there are\\nmany self-fertilising hermaphrodites; but here {101} currents in the water\\noffer an obvious means for an occasional cross. and, as in the case of\\nflowers, i have as yet failed, after consultation with one of the highest\\nauthorities, namely, professor huxley, to discover a single case of an\\nhermaphrodite animal with the organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed\\nwithin the body, that access from without and the occasional influence of a\\ndistinct individual can be shown to be physically impossible. cirripedes\\nlong appeared to me to present a case of very great difficulty under this\\npoint of view; but i have been enabled, by a fortunate chance, elsewhere to\\nprove that two individuals, though both are self-fertilising\\nhermaphrodites, do sometimes cross.\\n\\nit must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that, in the case\\nof both animals and plants, species of the same family and even of the same\\ngenus, though agreeing closely with each other in almost their whole\\norganisation, yet are not rarely, some of them hermaphrodites, and some of\\nthem unisexual. but if, in fact, all hermaphrodites do occasionally\\nintercross with other individuals, the difference between hermaphrodites\\nand unisexual species, as far as function is concerned, becomes very small.\\n\\nfrom these several considerations and from the many special facts which i\\nhave collected, but which i am not here able to give, i am strongly\\ninclined to suspect that, both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, an\\noccasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law of nature. i am\\nwell aware that there are, on this view, many cases of difficulty, some of\\nwhich i am trying to investigate. finally then, we may conclude that in\\nmany organic beings, a cross between two individuals is an obvious\\nnecessity for each birth; in many others it occurs perhaps only at long\\nintervals; but in none, as i suspect, can self-fertilisation go on for\\nperpetuity. {102}\\n\\n\\n\\n_circumstances favourable to natural selection._--this is an extremely\\nintricate subject. a large amount of inheritable and diversified\\nvariability is favourable, but i believe mere individual differences\\nsuffice for the work. a large number of individuals, by giving a better\\nchance for the appearance within any given period of profitable variations,\\nwill compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each individual, and\\nis, i believe, an extremely important element of success. though nature\\ngrants vast periods of time for the work of natural selection, she does not\\ngrant an indefinite period; for as all organic beings are striving, it may\\nbe said, to seize on each place in the economy of nature, if any one\\nspecies does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree\\nwith its competitors, it will soon be exterminated.\\n\\nin man\\'s methodical selection, a breeder selects for some definite object,\\nand free intercrossing will wholly stop his work. but when many men,\\nwithout intending to alter the breed, have a nearly common standard of\\nperfection, and all try to get and breed from the best animals, much\\nimprovement and modification surely but slowly follow from this unconscious\\nprocess of selection, notwithstanding a large amount of crossing with\\ninferior animals. thus it will be in nature; for within a confined area,\\nwith some place in its polity not so perfectly occupied as might be,\\nnatural selection will always tend to preserve all the individuals varying\\nin the right direction, though in different degrees, so as better to fill\\nup the unoccupied place. but if the area be large, its several districts\\nwill almost certainly present different conditions of life; and then if\\nnatural selection be modifying and improving a species in the several\\ndistricts, there will be intercrossing with the other individuals of the\\nsame species on the confines of each. and in {103} this case the effects of\\nintercrossing can hardly be counterbalanced by natural selection always\\ntending to modify all the individuals in each district in exactly the same\\nmanner to the conditions of each; for in a continuous area, the physical\\nconditions at least will generally graduate away insensibly from one\\ndistrict to another. the intercrossing will most affect those animals which\\nunite for each birth, which wander much, and which do not breed at a very\\nquick rate. hence in animals of this nature, for instance in birds,\\nvarieties will generally be confined to separated countries; and this i\\nbelieve to be the case. in hermaphrodite organisms which cross only\\noccasionally, and likewise in animals which unite for each birth, but which\\nwander little and which can increase at a very rapid rate, a new and\\nimproved variety might be quickly formed on any one spot, and might there\\nmaintain itself in a body, so that whatever intercrossing took place would\\nbe chiefly between the individuals of the same new variety. a local variety\\nwhen once thus formed might subsequently slowly spread to other districts.\\non the above principle, nurserymen always prefer getting seed from a large\\nbody of plants of the same variety, as the chance of intercrossing with\\nother varieties is thus lessened.\\n\\neven in the case of slow-breeding animals, which unite for each birth, we\\nmust not overrate the effects of intercrosses in retarding natural\\nselection; for i can bring a considerable catalogue of facts, showing that\\nwithin the same area, varieties of the same animal can long remain\\ndistinct, from haunting different stations, from breeding at slightly\\ndifferent seasons, or from varieties of the same kind preferring to pair\\ntogether.\\n\\nintercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping the\\nindividuals of the same species, or of the same variety, true and uniform\\nin character. it will {104} obviously thus act far more efficiently with\\nthose animals which unite for each birth; but i have already attempted to\\nshow that we have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place\\nwith all animals and with all plants. even if these take place only at long\\nintervals, i am convinced that the young thus produced will gain so much in\\nvigour and fertility over the offspring from long-continued\\nself-fertilisation, that they will have a better chance of surviving and\\npropagating their kind; and thus, in the long run, the influence of\\nintercrosses, even at rare intervals, will be great. if there exist organic\\nbeings which never intercross, uniformity of character can be retained\\namongst them, as long as their conditions of life remain the same, only\\nthrough the principle of inheritance, and through natural selection\\ndestroying any which depart from the proper type; but if their conditions\\nof life change and they undergo modification, uniformity of character can\\nbe given to their modified offspring, solely by natural selection\\npreserving the same favourable variations.\\n\\nisolation, also, is an important element in the process of natural\\nselection. in a confined or isolated area, if not very large, the organic\\nand inorganic conditions of life will generally be in a great degree\\nuniform; so that natural selection will tend to modify all the individuals\\nof a varying species throughout the area in the same manner in relation to\\nthe same conditions. intercrosses, also, with the individuals of the same\\nspecies, which otherwise would have inhabited the surrounding and\\ndifferently circumstanced districts, will be prevented. but isolation\\nprobably acts more efficiently in checking the immigration of better\\nadapted organisms, after any physical change, such as of climate or\\nelevation of the land, &c.; and thus new places in the natural economy of\\nthe country are left open for the old inhabitants to struggle for, and\\nbecome adapted to, through {105} modifications in their structure and\\nconstitution. lastly, isolation, by checking immigration and consequently\\ncompetition, will give time for any new variety to be slowly improved; and\\nthis may sometimes be of importance in the production of new species. if,\\nhowever, an isolated area be very small, either from being surrounded by\\nbarriers, or from having very peculiar physical conditions, the total\\nnumber of the individuals supported on it will necessarily be very small;\\nand fewness of individuals will greatly retard the production of new\\nspecies through natural selection, by decreasing the chance of the\\nappearance of favourable variations.\\n\\nif we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks, and look at any\\nsmall isolated area, such as an oceanic island, although the total number\\nof the species inhabiting it, will be found to be small, as we shall see in\\nour chapter on geographical distribution; yet of these species a very large\\nproportion are endemic,--that is, have been produced there, and nowhere\\nelse. hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly\\nfavourable for the production of new species. but we may thus greatly\\ndeceive ourselves, for to ascertain whether a small isolated area, or a\\nlarge open area like a continent, has been most favourable for the\\nproduction of new organic forms, we ought to make the comparison within\\nequal times; and this we are incapable of doing.\\n\\nalthough i do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importance in the\\nproduction of new species, on the whole i am inclined to believe that\\nlargeness of area is of more importance, more especially in the production\\nof species, which will prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of\\nspreading widely. throughout a great and open area, not only will there be\\na better chance of favourable variations arising from the large number of\\nindividuals of the same species {106} there supported, but the conditions\\nof life are infinitely complex from the large number of already existing\\nspecies; and if some of these many species become modified and improved,\\nothers will have to be improved in a corresponding degree or they will be\\nexterminated. each new form, also, as soon as it has been much improved,\\nwill be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus\\ncome into competition with many others. hence more new places will be\\nformed, and the competition to fill them will be more severe, on a large\\nthan on a small and isolated area. moreover, great areas, though now\\ncontinuous, owing to oscillations of level, will often have recently\\nexisted in a broken condition, so that the good effects of isolation will\\ngenerally, to a certain extent, have concurred. finally, i conclude that,\\nalthough small isolated areas probably have been in some respects highly\\nfavourable for the production of new species, yet that the course of\\nmodification will generally have been more rapid on large areas; and what\\nis more important, that the new forms produced on large areas, which\\nalready have been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will\\nspread most widely, will give rise to most new varieties and species, and\\nwill thus play an important part in the changing history of the organic\\nworld.\\n\\nwe can, perhaps, on these views, understand some facts which will be again\\nalluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution; for instance, that\\nthe productions of the smaller continent of australia have formerly\\nyielded, and apparently are now yielding, before those of the larger\\neuropг¦o-asiatic area. thus, also, it is that continental productions have\\neverywhere become so largely naturalised on islands. on a small island, the\\nrace for life will have been less severe, and there will have been less\\nmodification and less {107} extermination. hence, perhaps, it comes that\\nthe flora of madeira, according to oswald heer, resembles the extinct\\ntertiary flora of europe. all fresh-water basins, taken together, make a\\nsmall area compared with that of the sea or of the land; and, consequently,\\nthe competition between fresh-water productions will have been less severe\\nthan elsewhere; new forms will have been more slowly formed, and old forms\\nmore slowly exterminated. and it is in fresh water that we find seven\\ngenera of ganoid fishes, remnants of a once preponderant order: and in\\nfresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the\\nworld, as the ornithorhynchus and lepidosiren, which, like fossils, connect\\nto a certain extent orders now widely separated in the natural scale. these\\nanomalous forms may almost be called living fossils; they have endured to\\nthe present day, from having inhabited a confined area, and from having\\nthus been exposed to less severe competition.\\n\\nto sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural\\nselection, as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits. i\\nconclude, looking to the future, that for terrestrial productions a large\\ncontinental area, which will probably undergo many oscillations of level,\\nand which consequently will exist for long periods in a broken condition,\\nis the most favourable for the production of many new forms of life, likely\\nto endure long and to spread widely. for the area first existed as a\\ncontinent, and the inhabitants, at this period numerous in individuals and\\nkinds, will have been subjected to very severe competition. when converted\\nby subsidence into large separate islands, there will still exist many\\nindividuals of the same species on each island: intercrossing on the\\nconfines of the range of each species will thus be checked: after physical\\nchanges of any kind, immigration will be {108} prevented, so that new\\nplaces in the polity of each island will have to be filled up by\\nmodifications of the old inhabitants; and time will be allowed for the\\nvarieties in each to become well modified and perfected. when, by renewed\\nelevation, the islands shall be re-converted into a continental area, there\\nwill again be severe competition: the most favoured or improved varieties\\nwill be enabled to spread: there will be much extinction of the less\\nimproved forms, and the relative proportional numbers of the various\\ninhabitants of the renewed continent will again be changed; and again there\\nwill be a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the\\ninhabitants, and thus produce new species.\\n\\nthat natural selection will always act with extreme slowness, i fully\\nadmit. its action depends on there being places in the polity of nature,\\nwhich can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the country\\nundergoing modification of some kind. the existence of such places will\\noften depend on physical changes, which are generally very slow, and on the\\nimmigration of better adapted forms having been checked. but the action of\\nnatural selection will probably still oftener depend on some of the\\ninhabitants becoming slowly modified; the mutual relations of many of the\\nother inhabitants being thus disturbed. nothing can be effected, unless\\nfavourable variations occur, and variation itself is apparently always a\\nvery slow process. the process will often be greatly retarded by free\\nintercrossing. many will exclaim that these several causes are amply\\nsufficient wholly to stop the action of natural selection. i do not believe\\nso. on the other hand, i do believe that natural selection always acts very\\nslowly, often only at long intervals of time, and generally on only a very\\nfew of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time. i further\\nbelieve, that this very slow, {109} intermittent action of natural\\nselection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and\\nmanner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed.\\n\\nslow though the process of selection may be, if feeble man can do much by\\nhis powers of artificial selection, i can see no limit to the amount of\\nchange, to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between\\nall organic beings, one with another and with their physical conditions of\\nlife, which may be effected in the long course of time by nature\\'s power of\\nselection.\\n\\n\\n\\n_extinction._--this subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on\\ngeology; but it must be here alluded to from being intimately connected\\nwith natural selection. natural selection acts solely through the\\npreservation of variations in some way advantageous, which consequently\\nendure. but as from the high geometrical ratio of increase of all organic\\nbeings, each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, it follows\\nthat as each selected and favoured form increases in number, so will the\\nless favoured forms decrease and become rare. rarity, as geology tells us,\\nis the precursor to extinction. we can, also, see that any form represented\\nby few individuals will, during fluctuations in the seasons or in the\\nnumber of its enemies, run a good chance of utter extinction. but we may go\\nfurther than this; for as new forms are continually and slowly being\\nproduced, unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes on\\nperpetually and almost indefinitely increasing, numbers inevitably must\\nbecome extinct. that the number of specific forms has not indefinitely\\nincreased, geology shows us plainly; and indeed we can see reason why they\\nshould not have thus increased, for the number of places in the polity of\\nnature is not indefinitely great,--not that we {110} have any means of\\nknowing that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species. probably\\nno region is as yet fully stocked, for at the cape of good hope, where more\\nspecies of plants are crowded together than in any other quarter of the\\nworld, some foreign plants have become naturalised, without causing, as far\\nas we know, the extinction of any natives.\\n\\nfurthermore, the species which are most numerous in individuals will have\\nthe best chance of producing within any given period favourable variations.\\nwe have evidence of this, in the facts given in the second chapter, showing\\nthat it is the common species which afford the greatest number of recorded\\nvarieties, or incipient species. hence, rare species will be less quickly\\nmodified or improved within any given period, and they will consequently be\\nbeaten in the race for life by the modified descendants of the commoner\\nspecies.\\n\\nfrom these several considerations i think it inevitably follows, that as\\nnew species in the course of time are formed through natural selection,\\nothers will become rarer and rarer, and finally extinct. the forms which\\nstand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and\\nimprovement, will naturally suffer most. and we have seen in the chapter on\\nthe struggle for existence that it is the most closely-allied\\nforms,--varieties of the same species, and species of the same genus or of\\nrelated genera,--which, from having nearly the same structure,\\nconstitution, and habits, generally come into the severest competition with\\neach other. consequently, each new variety or species, during the progress\\nof its formation, will generally press hardest on its nearest kindred, and\\ntend to exterminate them. we see the same process of extermination amongst\\nour domesticated productions, through the selection of improved forms by\\nman. many curious {111} instances could be given showing how quickly new\\nbreeds of cattle, sheep, and other animals, and varieties of flowers, take\\nthe place of older and inferior kinds. in yorkshire, it is historically\\nknown that the ancient black cattle were displaced by the long-horns, and\\nthat these \"were swept away by the short-horns\" (i quote the words of an\\nagricultural writer) \"as if by some murderous pestilence.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n_divergence of character._--the principle, which i have designated by this\\nterm, is of high importance on my theory, and explains, as i believe,\\nseveral important facts. in the first place, varieties, even\\nstrongly-marked ones, though having somewhat of the character of\\nspecies--as is shown by the hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank\\nthem--yet certainly differ from each other far less than do good and\\ndistinct species. nevertheless, according to my view, varieties are species\\nin the process of formation, or are, as i have called them, incipient\\nspecies. how, then, does the lesser difference between varieties become\\naugmented into the greater difference between species? that this does\\nhabitually happen, we must infer from most of the innumerable species\\nthroughout nature presenting well-marked differences; whereas varieties,\\nthe supposed prototypes and parents of future well-marked species, present\\nslight and ill-defined differences. mere chance, as we may call it, might\\ncause one variety to differ in some character from its parents, and the\\noffspring of this variety again to differ from its parent in the very same\\ncharacter and in a greater degree; but this alone would never account for\\nso habitual and large an amount of difference as that between varieties of\\nthe same species and species of the same genus.\\n\\nas has always been my practice, let us seek light on {112} this head from\\nour domestic productions. we shall here find something analogous. a fancier\\nis struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak; another fancier is\\nstruck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak; and on the acknowledged\\nprinciple that \"fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard, but\\nlike extremes,\" they both go on (as has actually occurred with\\ntumbler-pigeons) choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer\\nbeaks, or with shorter and shorter beaks. again, we may suppose that at an\\nearly period one man preferred swifter horses; another stronger and more\\nbulky horses. the early differences would be very slight; in the course of\\ntime, from the continued selection of swifter horses by some breeders, and\\nof stronger ones by others, the differences would become greater, and would\\nbe noted as forming two sub-breeds; finally, after the lapse of centuries,\\nthe sub-breeds would become converted into two well-established and\\ndistinct breeds. as the differences slowly become greater, the inferior\\nanimals with intermediate characters, being neither very swift nor very\\nstrong, will have been neglected, and will have tended to disappear. here,\\nthen, we see in man\\'s productions the action of what may be called the\\nprinciple of divergence, causing differences, at first barely appreciable,\\nsteadily to increase, and the breeds to diverge in character both from each\\nother and from their common parent.\\n\\nbut how, it may be asked, can any analogous principle apply in nature? i\\nbelieve it can and does apply most efficiently, from the simple\\ncircumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species\\nbecome in structure, constitution, and habits, by so much will they be\\nbetter enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity\\nof nature, and so be enabled to increase in numbers. {113}\\n\\nwe can clearly see this in the case of animals with simple habits. take the\\ncase of a carnivorous quadruped, of which the number that can be supported\\nin any country has long ago arrived at its full average. if its natural\\npowers of increase be allowed to act, it can succeed in increasing (the\\ncountry not undergoing any change in its conditions) only by its varying\\ndescendants seizing on places at present occupied by other animals: some of\\nthem, for instance, being enabled to feed on new kinds of prey, either dead\\nor alive; some inhabiting new stations, climbing trees, frequenting water,\\nand some perhaps becoming less carnivorous. the more diversified in habits\\nand structure the descendants of our carnivorous animal became, the more\\nplaces they would be enabled to occupy. what applies to one animal will\\napply throughout all time to all animals--that is, if they vary--for\\notherwise natural selection can do nothing. so it will be with plants. it\\nhas been experimentally proved, that if a plot of ground be sown with one\\nspecies of grass, and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera\\nof grasses, a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage\\ncan thus be raised. the same has been found to hold good when first one\\nvariety and then several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on equal\\nspaces of ground. hence, if any one species of grass were to go on varying,\\nand those varieties were continually selected which differed from each\\nother in at all the same manner as distinct species and genera of grasses\\ndiffer from each other, a greater number of individual plants of this\\nspecies of grass, including its modified descendants, would succeed in\\nliving on the same piece of ground. and we well know that each species and\\neach variety of grass is annually sowing almost countless seeds; and thus,\\nas it may be said, is striving its utmost to increase its numbers. {114}\\nconsequently, i cannot doubt that in the course of many thousands of\\ngenerations, the most distinct varieties of any one species of grass would\\nalways have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing in numbers, and\\nthus of supplanting the less distinct varieties; and varieties, when\\nrendered very distinct from each other, take the rank of species.\\n\\nthe truth of the principle, that the greatest amount of life can be\\nsupported by great diversification of structure, is seen under many natural\\ncircumstances. in an extremely small area, especially if freely open to\\nimmigration, and where the contest between individual and individual must\\nbe severe, we always find great diversity in its inhabitants. for instance,\\ni found that a piece of turf, three feet by four in size, which had been\\nexposed for many years to exactly the same conditions, supported twenty\\nspecies of plants, and these belonged to eighteen genera and to eight\\norders, which shows how much these plants differed from each other. so it\\nis with the plants and insects on small and uniform islets; and so in small\\nponds of fresh water. farmers find that they can raise most food by a\\nrotation of plants belonging to the most different orders: nature follows\\nwhat may be called a simultaneous rotation. most of the animals and plants\\nwhich live close round any small piece of ground, could live on it\\n(supposing it not to be in any way peculiar in its nature), and may be said\\nto be striving to the utmost to live there; but, it is seen, that where\\nthey come into the closest competition with each other, the advantages of\\ndiversification of structure, with the accompanying differences of habit\\nand constitution, determine that the inhabitants, which thus jostle each\\nother most closely, shall, as a general rule, belong to what we call\\ndifferent genera and orders.\\n\\nthe same principle is seen in the naturalisation of {115} plants through\\nman\\'s agency in foreign lands. it might have been expected that the plants\\nwhich have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would generally\\nhave been closely allied to the indigenes; for these are commonly looked at\\nas specially created and adapted for their own country. it might, also,\\nperhaps have been expected that naturalised plants would have belonged to a\\nfew groups more especially adapted to certain stations in their new homes.\\nbut the case is very different; and alph. de candolle has well remarked in\\nhis great and admirable work, that floras gain by naturalisation,\\nproportionally with the number of the native genera and species, far more\\nin new genera than in new species. to give a single instance: in the last\\nedition of dr. asa gray\\'s \\'manual of the flora of the northern united\\nstates,\\' 260 naturalised plants are enumerated, and these belong to 162\\ngenera. we thus see that these naturalised plants are of a highly\\ndiversified nature. they differ, moreover, to a large extent from the\\nindigenes, for out of the 162 genera, no less than 100 genera are not there\\nindigenous, and thus a large proportional addition is made to the genera of\\nthese states.\\n\\nby considering the nature of the plants or animals which have struggled\\nsuccessfully with the indigenes of any country, and have there become\\nnaturalised, we may gain some crude idea in what manner some of the natives\\nwould have to be modified, in order to gain an advantage over the other\\nnatives; and we may at least safely infer that diversification of\\nstructure, amounting to new generic differences, would be profitable to\\nthem.\\n\\nthe advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same region is,\\nin fact, the same as that of the physiological division of labour in the\\norgans of the same individual body--a subject so well elucidated by milne\\n{116} edwards. no physiologist doubts that a stomach adapted to digest\\nvegetable matter alone, or flesh alone, draws most nutriment from these\\nsubstances. so in the general economy of any land, the more widely and\\nperfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different habits of\\nlife, so will a greater number of individuals be capable of there\\nsupporting themselves. a set of animals, with their organisation but little\\ndiversified, could hardly compete with a set more perfectly diversified in\\nstructure. it may be doubted, for instance, whether the australian\\nmarsupials, which are divided into groups differing but little from each\\nother, and feebly representing, as mr. waterhouse and others have remarked,\\nour carnivorous, ruminant, and rodent mammals, could successfully compete\\nwith these well-pronounced orders. in the australian mammals, we see the\\nprocess of diversification in an early and incomplete stage of development.\\n\\nafter the foregoing discussion, which ought to have been much amplified, we\\nmay, i think, assume that the modified descendants of any one species will\\nsucceed by so much the better as they become more diversified in structure,\\nand are thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings. now\\nlet us see how this principle of benefit being derived from divergence of\\ncharacter, combined with the principles of natural selection and of\\nextinction, will tend to act.\\n\\nthe accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather\\nperplexing subject. let a to l represent the species of a genus large in\\nits own country; these species are supposed to resemble each other in\\nunequal degrees, as is so generally the case in nature, and as is\\nrepresented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances. i\\nhave said a large genus, because we have seen in the second chapter, {117}\\nthat on an average more of the species of large genera vary than of small\\ngenera; and the varying species of the large genera present a greater\\nnumber of varieties. we have, also, seen that the species, which are the\\ncommonest and the most widely-diffused, vary more than rare species with\\nrestricted ranges. let (a) be a common, widely-diffused, and varying\\nspecies, belonging to a genus large in its own country. the little fan of\\ndiverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from (a), may\\nrepresent its varying offspring. the variations are supposed to be\\nextremely slight, but of the most diversified nature; they are not supposed\\nall to appear simultaneously, but often after long intervals of time; nor\\nare they all supposed to endure for equal periods. only those variations\\nwhich are in some way profitable will be preserved or naturally selected.\\nand here the importance of the principle of benefit being derived from\\ndivergence of character comes in; for this will generally lead to the most\\ndifferent or divergent variations (represented by the outer dotted lines)\\nbeing preserved and accumulated by natural selection. when a dotted line\\nreaches one of the horizontal lines, and is there marked by a small\\nnumbered letter, a sufficient amount of variation is supposed to have been\\naccumulated to have formed a fairly well-marked variety, such as would be\\nthought worthy of record in a systematic work.\\n\\n[illustration]\\n\\nthe intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram, may represent\\neach a thousand generations; but it would have been better if each had\\nrepresented ten thousand generations. after a thousand generations, species\\n(a) is supposed to have produced two fairly well-marked varieties, namely\\na^1 and m^1. these two varieties will generally continue to be exposed to\\nthe same conditions which made their parents variable, {118} and the\\ntendency to variability is in itself hereditary, consequently they will\\ntend to vary, and generally to vary in nearly the same manner as their\\nparents varied. moreover, these two varieties, being only slightly modified\\nforms, will tend to inherit those advantages which made their parent (a)\\nmore numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same country; they\\nwill likewise partake of those more general advantages which made the genus\\nto which the parent-species belonged, a large genus in its own country. and\\nthese circumstances we know to be favourable to the production of new\\nvarieties.\\n\\nif, then, these two varieties be variable, the most divergent of their\\nvariations will generally be preserved during the next thousand\\ngenerations. and after this interval, variety a^1 is supposed in the\\ndiagram to have produced variety a^2, which will, owing to the principle of\\ndivergence, differ more from (a) than did variety a^1. variety m^1 is\\nsupposed to have produced two varieties, namely m^2 and s^2, differing from\\neach other, and more considerably from their common parent (a). we may\\ncontinue the process by similar steps for any length of time; some of the\\nvarieties, after each thousand generations, producing only a single\\nvariety, but in a more and more modified condition, some producing two or\\nthree varieties, and some failing to produce any. thus the varieties or\\nmodified descendants, proceeding from the common parent (a), will generally\\ngo on increasing in number and diverging in character. in the diagram the\\nprocess is represented up to the ten-thousandth generation, and under a\\ncondensed and simplified form up to the fourteen-thousandth generation.\\n\\nbut i must here remark that i do not suppose that the process ever goes on\\nso regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in itself made\\nsomewhat irregular. {119} i am far from thinking that the most divergent\\nvarieties will invariably prevail and multiply: a medium form may often\\nlong endure, and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant;\\nfor natural selection will always act according to the nature of the places\\nwhich are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings; and\\nthis will depend on infinitely complex relations. but as a general rule,\\nthe more diversified in structure the descendants from any one species can\\nbe rendered, the more places they will be enabled to seize on, and the more\\ntheir modified progeny will be increased. in our diagram the line of\\nsuccession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered letters marking\\nthe successive forms which have become sufficiently distinct to be recorded\\nas varieties. but these breaks are imaginary, and might have been inserted\\nanywhere, after intervals long enough to have allowed the accumulation of a\\nconsiderable amount of divergent variation.\\n\\nas all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused species,\\nbelonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the same advantages\\nwhich made their parent successful in life, they will generally go on\\nmultiplying in number as well as diverging in character: this is\\nrepresented in the diagram by the several divergent branches proceeding\\nfrom (a). the modified offspring from the later and more highly improved\\nbranches in the lines of descent, will, it is probable, often take the\\nplace of, and so destroy, the earlier and less improved branches: this is\\nrepresented in the diagram by some of the lower branches not reaching to\\nthe upper horizontal lines. in some cases i do not doubt that the process\\nof modification will be confined to a single line of descent, and the\\nnumber of the descendants will not be increased; although the amount {120}\\nof divergent modification may have been increased in the successive\\ngenerations. this case would be represented in the diagram, if all the\\nlines proceeding from (a) were removed, excepting that from a^1 to a^{10}.\\nin the same way, for instance, the english race-horse and english pointer\\nhave apparently both gone on slowly diverging in character from their\\noriginal stocks, without either having given off any fresh branches or\\nraces.\\n\\nafter ten thousand generations, species (a) is supposed to have produced\\nthree forms, a^{10}, f^{10}, and m^{10}, which, from having diverged in\\ncharacter during the successive generations, will have come to differ\\nlargely, but perhaps unequally, from each other and from their common\\nparent. if we suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in\\nour diagram to be excessively small, these three forms may still be only\\nwell-marked varieties; or they may have arrived at the doubtful category of\\nsub-species; but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of\\nmodification to be more numerous or greater in amount, to convert these\\nthree forms into well-defined species: thus the diagram illustrates the\\nsteps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties are increased\\ninto the larger differences distinguishing species. by continuing the same\\nprocess for a greater number of generations (as shown in the diagram in a\\ncondensed and simplified manner), we get eight species, marked by the\\nletters between a^{14} and m^{14}, all descended from (a). thus, as i\\nbelieve, species are multiplied and genera are formed.\\n\\nin a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary. in\\nthe diagram i have assumed that a second species (i) has produced, by\\nanalogous steps, after ten thousand generations, either two well-marked\\nvarieties (w^{10} and z^{10}) or two species, according to the amount of\\nchange supposed to be represented {121} between the horizontal lines. after\\nfourteen thousand generations, six new species, marked by the letters\\nn^{14} to z^{14}, are supposed to have been produced. in each genus, the\\nspecies, which are already extremely different in character, will generally\\ntend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants; for these will\\nhave the best chance of filling new and widely different places in the\\npolity of nature: hence in the diagram i have chosen the extreme species\\n(a), and the nearly extreme species (i), as those which have largely\\nvaried, and have given rise to new varieties and species. the other nine\\nspecies (marked by capital letters) of our original genus, may for a long\\nperiod continue to transmit unaltered descendants; and this is shown in the\\ndiagram by the dotted lines not prolonged far upwards from want of space.\\n\\nbut during the process of modification, represented in the diagram, another\\nof our principles, namely that of extinction, will have played an important\\npart. as in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily acts\\nby the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life over\\nother forms, there will be a constant tendency in the improved descendants\\nof any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent\\ntheir predecessors and their original parent. for it should be remembered\\nthat the competition will generally be most severe between those forms\\nwhich are most nearly related to each other in habits, constitution, and\\nstructure. hence all the intermediate forms between the earlier and later\\nstates, that is between the less and more improved state of a species, as\\nwell as the original parent-species itself, will generally tend to become\\nextinct. so it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of\\ndescent, which will be conquered by later and improved lines of descent.\\nif, however, the {122} modified offspring of a species get into some\\ndistinct country, or become quickly adapted to some quite new station, in\\nwhich child and parent do not come into competition, both may continue to\\nexist.\\n\\nif then our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of\\nmodification, species (a) and all the earlier varieties will have become\\nextinct, having been replaced by eight new species (a^{14} to m^{14}); and\\n(i) will have been replaced by six (n^{14} to z^{14}) new species.\\n\\nbut we may go further than this. the original species of our genus were\\nsupposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees, as is so generally the\\ncase in nature; species (a) being more nearly related to b, c, and d, than\\nto the other species; and species (i) more to g, h, k, l, than to the\\nothers. these two species (a) and (i), were also supposed to be very common\\nand widely diffused species, so that they must originally have had some\\nadvantage over most of the other species of the genus. their modified\\ndescendants, fourteen in number at the fourteen-thousandth generation, will\\nprobably have inherited some of the same advantages: they have also been\\nmodified and improved in a diversified manner at each stage of descent, so\\nas to have become adapted to many related places in the natural economy of\\ntheir country. it seems, therefore, to me extremely probable that they will\\nhave taken the places of, and thus exterminated, not only their parents (a)\\nand (i), but likewise some of the original species which were most nearly\\nrelated to their parents. hence very few of the original species will have\\ntransmitted offspring to the fourteen-thousandth generation. we may suppose\\nthat only one (f), of the two species which were least closely related to\\nthe other nine original species, has transmitted descendants to this late\\nstage of descent. {123}\\n\\nthe new species in our diagram descended from the original eleven species,\\nwill now be fifteen in number. owing to the divergent tendency of natural\\nselection, the extreme amount of difference in character between species\\na^{14} and z^{14} will be much greater than that between the most different\\nof the original eleven species. the new species, moreover, will be allied\\nto each other in a widely different manner. of the eight descendants from\\n(a) the three marked a^{14}, q^{14}, p^{14}, will be nearly related from\\nhaving recently branched off from a^{10}; b^{14} and f^{14}, from having\\ndiverged at an earlier period from a^5, will be in some degree distinct\\nfrom the three first-named species; and lastly, o^{14}, e^{14} and m^{14},\\nwill be nearly related one to the other, but from having diverged at the\\nfirst commencement of the process of modification, will be widely different\\nfrom the other five species, and may constitute a sub-genus or even a\\ndistinct genus.\\n\\nthe six descendants from (i) will form two sub-genera or even genera. but\\nas the original species (i) differed largely from (a), standing nearly at\\nthe extreme points of the original genus, the six descendants from (i)\\nwill, owing to inheritance alone, differ considerably from the eight\\ndescendants from (a); the two groups, moreover, are supposed to have gone\\non diverging in different directions. the intermediate species, also (and\\nthis is a very important consideration), which connected the original\\nspecies (a) and (i), have all become, excepting (f), extinct, and have left\\nno descendants. hence the six new species descended from (i), and the eight\\ndescended from (a), will have to be ranked as very distinct genera, or even\\nas distinct sub-families.\\n\\nthus it is, as i believe, that two or more genera are produced by descent\\nwith modification, from two or more species of the same genus. and the two\\nor {124} more parent-species are supposed to have descended from some one\\nspecies of an earlier genus. in our diagram, this is indicated by the\\nbroken lines, beneath the capital letters, converging in sub-branches\\ndownwards towards a single point; this point representing a single species,\\nthe supposed single parent of our several new sub-genera and genera.\\n\\nit is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new\\nspecies f^{14}, which is supposed not to have diverged much in character,\\nbut to have retained the form of (f), either unaltered or altered only in a\\nslight degree. in this case, its affinities to the other fourteen new\\nspecies will be of a curious and circuitous nature. having descended from a\\nform which stood between the two parent-species (a) and (i), now supposed\\nto be extinct and unknown, it will be in some degree intermediate in\\ncharacter between the two groups descended from these species. but as these\\ntwo groups have gone on diverging in character from the type of their\\nparents, the new species (f^{14}) will not be directly intermediate between\\nthem, but rather between types of the two groups; and every naturalist will\\nbe able to bring some such case before his mind.\\n\\nin the diagram, each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to\\nrepresent a thousand generations, but each may represent a million or\\nhundred million generations, and likewise a section of the successive\\nstrata of the earth\\'s crust including extinct remains. we shall, when we\\ncome to our chapter on geology, have to refer again to this subject, and i\\nthink we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the affinities of\\nextinct beings, which, though generally belonging to the same orders, or\\nfamilies, or genera, with those now living, yet are often, in some degree,\\nintermediate in character between existing groups; and we can understand\\nthis fact, for {125} the extinct species lived at very ancient epochs when\\nthe branching lines of descent had diverged less.\\n\\ni see no reason to limit the process of modification, as now explained, to\\nthe formation of genera alone. if, in our diagram, we suppose the amount of\\nchange represented by each successive group of diverging dotted lines to be\\nvery great, the forms marked a^{14} to p^{14}, those marked b^{14} and\\nf^{14}, and those marked o^{14} to m^{14}, will form three very distinct\\ngenera. we shall also have two very distinct genera descended from (i); and\\nas these latter two genera, both from continued divergence of character and\\nfrom inheritance from a different parent, will differ widely from the three\\ngenera descended from (a), the two little groups of genera will form two\\ndistinct families, or even orders, according to the amount of divergent\\nmodification supposed to be represented in the diagram. and the two new\\nfamilies, or orders, will have descended from two species of the original\\ngenus; and these two species are supposed to have descended from one\\nspecies of a still more ancient and unknown genus.\\n\\nwe have seen that in each country it is the species of the larger genera\\nwhich oftenest present varieties or incipient species. this, indeed, might\\nhave been expected; for as natural selection acts through one form having\\nsome advantage over other forms in the struggle for existence, it will\\nchiefly act on those which already have some advantage; and the largeness\\nof any group shows that its species have inherited from a common ancestor\\nsome advantage in common. hence, the struggle for the production of new and\\nmodified descendants, will mainly lie between the larger groups, which are\\nall trying to increase in number. one large group will slowly conquer\\nanother large group, reduce its numbers, and thus lessen its chance of\\nfurther variation and improvement. within the same large {126} group, the\\nlater and more highly perfected sub-groups, from branching out and seizing\\non many new places in the polity of nature, will constantly tend to\\nsupplant and destroy the earlier and less improved sub-groups. small and\\nbroken groups and sub-groups will finally disappear. looking to the future,\\nwe can predict that the groups of organic beings which are now large and\\ntriumphant, and which are least broken up, that is, which as yet have\\nsuffered least extinction, will for a long period continue to increase. but\\nwhich groups will ultimately prevail, no man can predict; for we well know\\nthat many groups, formerly most extensively developed, have now become\\nextinct. looking still more remotely to the future, we may predict that,\\nowing to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups, a\\nmultitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct, and leave no\\nmodified descendants; and consequently that of the species living at any\\none period, extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote futurity. i\\nshall have to return to this subject in the chapter on classification, but\\ni may add that on this view of extremely few of the more ancient species\\nhaving transmitted descendants, and on the view of all the descendants of\\nthe same species making a class, we can understand how it is that there\\nexist but very few classes in each main division of the animal and\\nvegetable kingdoms. although extremely few of the most ancient species may\\nnow have living and modified descendants, yet at the most remote geological\\nperiod, the earth may have been as well peopled with many species of many\\ngenera, families, orders, and classes, as at the present day.\\n\\n\\n\\n_summary of chapter._--if during the long course of ages and under varying\\nconditions of life, organic beings {127} vary at all in the several parts\\nof their organisation, and i think this cannot be disputed; if there be,\\nowing to the high geometrical ratio of increase of each species, a severe\\nstruggle for life at some age, season, or year, and this certainly cannot\\nbe disputed; then, considering the infinite complexity of the relations of\\nall organic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence,\\ncausing an infinite diversity in structure, constitution, and habits, to be\\nadvantageous to them, i think it would be a most extraordinary fact if no\\nvariation ever had occurred useful to each being\\'s own welfare, in the same\\nmanner as so many variations have occurred useful to man. but if variations\\nuseful to any organic being do occur, assuredly individuals thus\\ncharacterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle\\nfor life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to\\nproduce offspring similarly characterised. this principle of preservation,\\ni have called, for the sake of brevity, natural selection; and it leads to\\nthe improvement of each creature in relation to its organic and inorganic\\nconditions of life.\\n\\nnatural selection, on the principle of qualities being inherited at\\ncorresponding ages, can modify the egg, seed, or young, as easily as the\\nadult. amongst many animals, sexual selection will give its aid to ordinary\\nselection, by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted males the\\ngreatest number of offspring. sexual selection will also give characters\\nuseful to the males alone, in their struggles with other males.\\n\\nwhether natural selection has really thus acted in nature, in modifying and\\nadapting the various forms of life to their several conditions and\\nstations, must be judged of by the general tenour and balance of evidence\\ngiven in the following chapters. but we already see how it entails\\nextinction; and how largely extinction {128} has acted in the world\\'s\\nhistory, geology plainly declares. natural selection, also, leads to\\ndivergence of character; for more living beings can be supported on the\\nsame area the more they diverge in structure, habits, and constitution, of\\nwhich we see proof by looking to the inhabitants of any small spot or to\\nnaturalised productions. therefore during the modification of the\\ndescendants of any one species, and during the incessant struggle of all\\nspecies to increase in numbers, the more diversified these descendants\\nbecome, the better will be their chance of succeeding in the battle for\\nlife. thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same\\nspecies, steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater\\ndifferences between species of the same genus, or even of distinct genera.\\n\\nwe have seen that it is the common, the widely-diffused, and widely-ranging\\nspecies, belonging to the larger genera, which vary most; and these tend to\\ntransmit to their modified offspring that superiority which now makes them\\ndominant in their own countries. natural selection, as has just been\\nremarked, leads to divergence of character and to much extinction of the\\nless improved and intermediate forms of life. on these principles, i\\nbelieve, the nature of the affinities of all organic beings may be\\nexplained. it is a truly wonderful fact--the wonder of which we are apt to\\noverlook from familiarity--that all animals and all plants throughout all\\ntime and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to\\ngroup, in the manner which we everywhere behold--namely, varieties of the\\nsame species most closely related together, species of the same genus less\\nclosely and unequally related together, forming sections and sub-genera,\\nspecies of distinct genera much less closely related, and genera related in\\ndifferent degrees, forming {129} sub-families, families, orders,\\nsub-classes, and classes. the several subordinate groups in any class\\ncannot be ranked in a single file, but seem rather to be clustered round\\npoints, and these round other points, and so on in almost endless cycles.\\non the view that each species has been independently created, i can see no\\nexplanation of this great fact in the classification of all organic beings;\\nbut, to the best of my judgment, it is explained through inheritance and\\nthe complex action of natural selection, entailing extinction and\\ndivergence of character, as we have seen illustrated in the diagram.\\n\\nthe affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been\\nrepresented by a great tree. i believe this simile largely speaks the\\ntruth. the green and budding twigs may represent existing species; and\\nthose produced during each former year may represent the long succession of\\nextinct species. at each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried\\nto branch out on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs\\nand branches, in the same manner as species and groups of species have\\ntried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life. the limbs\\ndivided into great branches, and these into lesser and lesser branches,\\nwere themselves once, when the tree was small, budding twigs; and this\\nconnexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well\\nrepresent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups\\nsubordinate to groups. of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was\\na mere bush, only two or three, now grown into great branches, yet survive\\nand bear all the other branches; so with the species which lived during\\nlong-past geological periods, very few now have living and modified\\ndescendants. from the first growth of the tree, many a limb and branch has\\ndecayed and dropped off; and these lost branches of various {130} sizes may\\nrepresent those whole orders, families, and genera which have now no living\\nrepresentatives, and which are known to us only from having been found in a\\nfossil state. as we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing\\nfrom a fork low down in a tree, and which by some chance has been favoured\\nand is still alive on its summit, so we occasionally see an animal like the\\nornithorhynchus or lepidosiren, which in some small degree connects by its\\naffinities two large branches of life, and which has apparently been saved\\nfrom fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station. as buds\\ngive rise by growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and\\novertop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation i believe it\\nhas been with the great tree of life, which fills with its dead and broken\\nbranches the crust of the earth, and covers the surface with its ever\\nbranching and beautiful ramifications.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *

  manner--reversions to long-lost characters--summary.\\n\\ni have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations--so common and\\nmultiform in organic beings under domestication, and in a lesser degree in\\nthose in a state of nature--had been due to chance. this, of course, is a\\nwholly incorrect expression, but it serves to acknowledge plainly our\\nignorance of the cause of each particular variation. some authors believe\\nit to be as much the function of the reproductive system to produce\\nindividual differences, or very slight deviations of structure, as to make\\nthe child like its parents. but the much greater variability, as well as\\nthe greater frequency of monstrosities, under domestication or cultivation,\\nthan under nature, leads me to believe that deviations of structure are in\\nsome way due to the nature of the conditions of life, to which the parents\\nand their more remote ancestors have been exposed during several\\ngenerations. i have remarked in the first chapter--but a long catalogue of\\nfacts which cannot be here given would be necessary to show the truth of\\nthe remark--that the reproductive system is eminently susceptible to\\nchanges in the conditions of life; and to {132} this system being\\nfunctionally disturbed in the parents, i chiefly attribute the varying or\\nplastic condition of the offspring. the male and female sexual elements\\nseem to be affected before that union takes place which is to form a new\\nbeing. in the case of \"sporting\" plants, the bud, which in its earliest\\ncondition does not apparently differ essentially from an ovule, is alone\\naffected. but why, because the reproductive system is disturbed, this or\\nthat part should vary more or less, we are profoundly ignorant.\\nnevertheless, we can here and there dimly catch a faint ray of light, and\\nwe may feel sure that there must be some cause for each deviation of\\nstructure, however slight.\\n\\nhow much direct effect difference of climate, food, &c., produces on any\\nbeing is extremely doubtful. my impression is, that the effect is extremely\\nsmall in the case of animals, but perhaps rather more in that of plants. we\\nmay, at least, safely conclude that such influences cannot have produced\\nthe many striking and complex co-adaptations of structure between one\\norganic being and another, which we see everywhere throughout nature. some\\nlittle influence may be attributed to climate, food, &c.: thus, e. forbes\\nspeaks confidently that shells at their southern limit, and when living in\\nshallow water, are more brightly coloured than those of the same species\\nfurther north or from greater depths. gould believes that birds of the same\\nspecies are more brightly coloured under a clear atmosphere, than when\\nliving on islands or near the coast. so with insects, wollaston is\\nconvinced that residence near the sea affects their colours. moquin-tandon\\ngives a list of plants which when growing near the sea-shore have their\\nleaves in some degree fleshy, though not elsewhere fleshy. several other\\nsuch cases could be given.\\n\\nthe fact of varieties of one species, when they range {133} into the zone\\nof habitation of other species, often acquiring in a very slight degree\\nsome of the characters of such species, accords with our view that species\\nof all kinds are only well-marked and permanent varieties. thus the species\\nof shells which are confined to tropical and shallow seas are generally\\nbrighter-coloured than those confined to cold and deeper seas. the birds\\nwhich are confined to continents are, according to mr. gould,\\nbrighter-coloured than those of islands. the insect-species confined to\\nsea-coasts, as every collector knows, are often brassy or lurid. plants\\nwhich live exclusively on the sea-side are very apt to have fleshy leaves.\\nhe who believes in the creation of each species, will have to say that this\\nshell, for instance, was created with bright colours for a warm sea; but\\nthat this other shell became bright-coloured by variation when it ranged\\ninto warmer or shallower waters.\\n\\nwhen a variation is of the slightest use to a being, we cannot tell how\\nmuch of it to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection,\\nand how much to the conditions of life. thus, it is well known to furriers\\nthat animals of the same species have thicker and better fur the more\\nsevere the climate is under which they have lived; but who can tell how\\nmuch of this difference may be due to the warmest-clad individuals having\\nbeen favoured and preserved during many generations, and how much to the\\ndirect action of the severe climate? for it would appear that climate has\\nsome direct action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds.\\n\\ninstances could be given of the same variety being produced under\\nconditions of life as different as can well be conceived; and, on the other\\nhand, of different varieties being produced from the same species under the\\nsame conditions. such facts show how indirectly {134} the conditions of\\nlife act. again, innumerable instances are known to every naturalist of\\nspecies keeping true, or not varying at all, although living under the most\\nopposite climates. such considerations as these incline me to lay very\\nlittle weight on the direct action of the conditions of life. indirectly,\\nas already remarked, they seem to play an important part in affecting the\\nreproductive system, and in thus inducing variability; and natural\\nselection will then accumulate all profitable variations, however slight,\\nuntil they become plainly developed and appreciable by us.\\n\\n\\n\\n_effects of use and disuse._--from the facts alluded to in the first\\nchapter, i think there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals\\nstrengthens and enlarges certain parts, and disuse diminishes them; and\\nthat such modifications are inherited. under free nature, we can have no\\nstandard of comparison, by which to judge of the effects of long-continued\\nuse or disuse, for we know not the parent-forms; but many animals have\\nstructures which can be explained by the effects of disuse. as professor\\nowen has remarked, there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that\\ncannot fly; yet there are several in this state. the logger-headed duck of\\nsouth america can only flap along the surface of the water, and has its\\nwings in nearly the same condition as the domestic aylesbury duck. as the\\nlarger ground-feeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger, i\\nbelieve that the nearly wingless condition of several birds, which now\\ninhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands, tenanted by no\\nbeast of prey, has been caused by disuse. the ostrich indeed inhabits\\ncontinents and is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by flight,\\nbut by kicking it can defend itself from enemies, as well as any of the\\nsmaller {135} quadrupeds. we may imagine that the early progenitor of the\\nostrich had habits like those of a bustard, and that as natural selection\\nincreased in successive generations the size and weight of its body, its\\nlegs were used more, and its wings less, until they became incapable of\\nflight.\\n\\nkirby has remarked (and i have observed the same fact) that the anterior\\ntarsi, or feet, of many male dung-feeding beetles are very often broken\\noff; he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection, and not one had\\neven a relic left. in the onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually lost,\\nthat the insect has been described as not having them. in some other genera\\nthey are present, but in a rudimentary condition. in the ateuchus or sacred\\nbeetle of the egyptians, they are totally deficient. there is not\\nsufficient evidence to induce me to believe that mutilations are ever\\ninherited; and i should prefer explaining the entire absence of the\\nanterior tarsi in ateuchus, and their rudimentary condition in some other\\ngenera, by the long-continued effects of disuse in their progenitors; for\\nas the tarsi are almost always lost in many dung-feeding beetles, they must\\nbe lost early in life, and therefore cannot be much used by these insects.\\n\\nin some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of structure\\nwhich are wholly, or mainly, due to natural selection. mr. wollaston has\\ndiscovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles, out of the 550 species\\ninhabiting madeira, are so far deficient in wings that they cannot fly; and\\nthat of the twenty-nine endemic genera, no less than twenty-three genera\\nhave all their species in this condition! several facts, namely, that\\nbeetles in many parts of the world are frequently blown to sea and perish;\\nthat the beetles in madeira, as observed by mr. wollaston, lie much\\nconcealed, {136} until the wind lulls and the sun shines; that the\\nproportion of wingless beetles is larger on the exposed desertas than in\\nmadeira itself; and especially the extraordinary fact, so strongly insisted\\non by mr. wollaston, of the almost entire absence of certain large groups\\nof beetles, elsewhere excessively numerous, and which groups have habits of\\nlife almost necessitating frequent flight;--these several considerations\\nhave made me believe that the wingless condition of so many madeira beetles\\nis mainly due to the action of natural selection, but combined probably\\nwith disuse. for during thousands of successive generations each individual\\nbeetle which flew least, either from its wings having been ever so little\\nless perfectly developed or from indolent habit, will have had the best\\nchance of surviving from not being blown out to sea; and, on the other\\nhand, those beetles which most readily took to flight would oftenest have\\nbeen blown to sea and thus have been destroyed.\\n\\nthe insects in madeira which are not ground-feeders, and which, as the\\nflower-feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera, must habitually use their wings\\nto gain their subsistence, have, as mr. wollaston suspects, their wings not\\nat all reduced, but even enlarged. this is quite compatible with the action\\nof natural selection. for when a new insect first arrived on the island,\\nthe tendency of natural selection to enlarge or to reduce the wings, would\\ndepend on whether a greater number of individuals were saved by\\nsuccessfully battling with the winds, or by giving up the attempt and\\nrarely or never flying. as with mariners shipwrecked near a coast, it would\\nhave been better for the good swimmers if they had been able to swim still\\nfurther, whereas it would have been better for the bad swimmers if they had\\nnot been able to swim at all and had stuck to the wreck. {137}\\n\\nthe eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size,\\nand in some cases are quite covered up by skin and fur. this state of the\\neyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse, but aided perhaps by\\nnatural selection. in south america, a burrowing rodent, the tuco-tuco, or\\nctenomys, is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole; and i was\\nassured by a spaniard, who had often caught them, that they were frequently\\nblind; one which i kept alive was certainly in this condition, the cause,\\nas appeared on dissection, having been inflammation of the nictitating\\nmembrane. as frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any\\nanimal, and as eyes are certainly not indispensable to animals with\\nsubterranean habits, a reduction in their size with the adhesion of the\\neyelids and growth of fur over them, might in such case be an advantage;\\nand if so, natural selection would constantly aid the effects of disuse.\\n\\nit is well known that several animals, belonging to the most different\\nclasses, which inhabit the caves of styria and of kentucky, are blind. in\\nsome of the crabs the foot-stalk for the eye remains, though the eye is\\ngone; the stand for the telescope is there, though the telescope with its\\nglasses has been lost. as it is difficult to imagine that eyes, though\\nuseless, could be in any way injurious to animals living in darkness, i\\nattribute their loss wholly to disuse. in one of the blind animals, namely,\\nthe cave-rat, the eyes are of immense size; and professor silliman thought\\nthat it regained, after living some days in the light, some slight power of\\nvision. in the same manner as in madeira the wings of some of the insects\\nhave been enlarged, and the wings of others have been reduced by natural\\nselection aided by use and disuse, so in the case of the cave-rat natural\\nselection seems to have struggled with the loss of light and {138} to have\\nincreased the size of the eyes; whereas with all the other inhabitants of\\nthe caves, disuse by itself seems to have done its work.\\n\\nit is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep\\nlimestone caverns under a nearly similar climate; so that on the common\\nview of the blind animals having been separately created for the american\\nand european caverns, close similarity in their organisation and affinities\\nmight have been expected; but, as schiг¶dte and others have remarked, this\\nis not the case, and the cave-insects of the two continents are not more\\nclosely allied than might have been anticipated from the general\\nresemblance of the other inhabitants of north america and europe. on my\\nview we must suppose that american animals, having ordinary powers of\\nvision, slowly migrated by successive generations from the outer world into\\nthe deeper and deeper recesses of the kentucky caves, as did european\\nanimals into the caves of europe. we have some evidence of this gradation\\nof habit; for, as schiг¶dte remarks, \"animals not far remote from ordinary\\nforms, prepare the transition from light to darkness. next follow those\\nthat are constructed for twilight; and, last of all, those destined for\\ntotal darkness.\" by the time that an animal had reached, after numberless\\ngenerations, the deepest recesses, disuse will on this view have more or\\nless perfectly obliterated its eyes, and natural selection will often have\\neffected other changes, such as an increase in the length of the antennг¦ or\\npalpi, as a compensation for blindness. notwithstanding such modifications,\\nwe might expect still to see in the cave-animals of america, affinities to\\nthe other inhabitants of that continent, and in those of europe, to the\\ninhabitants of the european continent. and this is the case with some of\\nthe american cave-animals, as i hear from {139} professor dana; and some of\\nthe european cave-insects are very closely allied to those of the\\nsurrounding country. it would be most difficult to give any rational\\nexplanation of the affinities of the blind cave-animals to the other\\ninhabitants of the two continents on the ordinary view of their independent\\ncreation. that several of the inhabitants of the caves of the old and new\\nworlds should be closely related, we might expect from the well-known\\nrelationship of most of their other productions. far from feeling any\\nsurprise that some of the cave-animals should be very anomalous, as agassiz\\nhas remarked in regard to the blind fish, the amblyopsis, and as is the\\ncase with the blind proteus with reference to the reptiles of europe, i am\\nonly surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved,\\nowing to the less severe competition to which the inhabitants of these dark\\nabodes will probably have been exposed.\\n\\n\\n\\n_acclimatisation._--habit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of\\nflowering, in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate, in the\\ntime of sleep, &c., and this leads me to say a few words on\\nacclimatisation. as it is extremely common for species of the same genus to\\ninhabit very hot and very cold countries, and as i believe that all the\\nspecies of the same genus have descended from a single parent, if this view\\nbe correct, acclimatisation must be readily effected during long-continued\\ndescent. it is notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its\\nown home: species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot\\nendure a tropical climate, or conversely. so again, many succulent plants\\ncannot endure a damp climate. but the degree of adaptation of species to\\nthe climates under which they live is often overrated. {140} we may infer\\nthis from our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported\\nplant will endure our climate, and from the number of plants and animals\\nbrought from warmer countries which here enjoy good health. we have reason\\nto believe that species in a state of nature are limited in their ranges by\\nthe competition of other organic beings quite as much as, or more than, by\\nadaptation to particular climates. but whether or not the adaptation be\\ngenerally very close, we have evidence, in the case of some few plants, of\\ntheir becoming, to a certain extent, naturally habituated to different\\ntemperatures, or becoming acclimatised: thus the pines and rhododendrons,\\nraised from seed collected by dr. hooker from trees growing at different\\nheights on the himalaya, were found in this country to possess different\\nconstitutional powers of resisting cold. mr. thwaites informs me that he\\nhas observed similar facts in ceylon, and analogous observations have been\\nmade by mr. h. c. watson on european species of plants brought from the\\nazores to england. in regard to animals, several authentic cases could be\\ngiven of species within historical times having largely extended their\\nrange from warmer to cooler latitudes, and conversely; but we do not\\npositively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native\\nclimate, but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case; nor do we\\nknow that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their new homes.\\n\\nas i believe that our domestic animals were originally chosen by\\nuncivilised man because they were useful and bred readily under\\nconfinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable of\\nfar-extended transportation, i think the common and extraordinary capacity\\nin our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different\\nclimates but of being perfectly {141} fertile (a far severer test) under\\nthem, may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other animals,\\nnow in a state of nature, could easily be brought to bear widely different\\nclimates. we must not, however, push the foregoing argument too far, on\\naccount of the probable origin of some of our domestic animals from several\\nwild stocks: the blood, for instance, of a tropical and arctic wolf or wild\\ndog may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds. the rat and mouse cannot\\nbe considered as domestic animals, but they have been transported by man to\\nmany parts of the world, and now have a far wider range than any other\\nrodent, living free under the cold climate of faroe in the north and of the\\nfalklands in the south, and on many islands in the torrid zones. hence i am\\ninclined to look at adaptation to any special climate as a quality readily\\ngrafted on an innate wide flexibility of constitution, which is common to\\nmost animals. on this view, the capacity of enduring the most different\\nclimates by man himself and by his domestic animals, and such facts as that\\nformer species of the elephant and rhinoceros were capable of enduring a\\nglacial climate, whereas the living species are now all tropical or\\nsub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked at as anomalies, but\\nmerely as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution, brought,\\nunder peculiar circumstances, into play.\\n\\nhow much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is due\\nto mere habit, and how much to the natural selection of varieties having\\ndifferent innate constitutions, and how much to both means combined, is a\\nvery obscure question. that habit or custom has some influence i must\\nbelieve, both from analogy, and from the incessant advice given in\\nagricultural works, even in the ancient encyclopг¦dias of china, to be very\\n{142} cautious in transposing animals from one district to another; for it\\nis not likely that man should have succeeded in selecting so many breeds\\nand sub-breeds with constitutions specially fitted for their own districts:\\nthe result must, i think, be due to habit. on the other hand, i can see no\\nreason to doubt that natural selection will continually tend to preserve\\nthose individuals which are born with constitutions best adapted to their\\nnative countries. in treatises on many kinds of cultivated plants, certain\\nvarieties are said to withstand certain climates better than others: this\\nis very strikingly shown in works on fruit trees published in the united\\nstates, in which certain varieties are habitually recommended for the\\nnorthern, and others for the southern states; and as most of these\\nvarieties are of recent origin, they cannot owe their constitutional\\ndifferences to habit. the case of the jerusalem artichoke, which is never\\npropagated by seed, and of which consequently new varieties have not been\\nproduced, has even been advanced--for it is now as tender as ever it\\nwas--as proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected! the case, also, of\\nthe kidney-bean has been often cited for a similar purpose, and with much\\ngreater weight; but until some one will sow, during a score of generations,\\nhis kidney-beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by\\nfrost, and then collect seed from the few survivors, with care to prevent\\naccidental crosses, and then again get seed from these seedlings, with the\\nsame precautions, the experiment cannot be said to have been even tried.\\nnor let it be supposed that no differences in the constitution of seedling\\nkidney-beans ever appear, for an account has been published how much more\\nhardy some seedlings appeared to be than others.\\n\\non the whole, i think we may conclude that habit, {143} use, and disuse,\\nhave, in some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the\\nconstitution, and of the structure of various organs; but that the effects\\nof use and disuse have often been largely combined with, and sometimes\\novermastered by the natural selection of innate variations.\\n\\n\\n\\n_correlation of growth._--i mean by this expression that the whole\\norganisation is so tied together during its growth and development, that\\nwhen slight variations in any one part occur, and are accumulated through\\nnatural selection, other parts become modified. this is a very important\\nsubject, most imperfectly understood. the most obvious case is, that\\nmodifications accumulated solely for the good of the young or larva, will,\\nit may safely be concluded, affect the structure of the adult; in the same\\nmanner as any malconformation affecting the early embryo, seriously affects\\nthe whole organisation of the adult. the several parts of the body which\\nare homologous, and which, at an early embryonic period, are alike, seem\\nliable to vary in an allied manner: we see this in the right and left sides\\nof the body varying in the same manner; in the front and hind legs, and\\neven in the jaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed\\nto be homologous with the limbs. these tendencies, i do not doubt, may be\\nmastered more or less completely by natural selection: thus a family of\\nstags once existed with an antler only on one side; and if this had been of\\nany great use to the breed it might probably have been rendered permanent\\nby natural selection.\\n\\nhomologous parts, as has been remarked by some authors, tend to cohere;\\nthis is often seen in monstrous plants; and nothing is more common than the\\nunion of homologous parts in normal structures, as the union of {144} the\\npetals of the corolla into a tube. hard parts seem to affect the form of\\nadjoining soft parts; it is believed by some authors that the diversity in\\nthe shape of the pelvis in birds causes the remarkable diversity in the\\nshape of their kidneys. others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the\\nhuman mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the child. in\\nsnakes, according to schlegel, the shape of the body and the manner of\\nswallowing determine the position of several of the most important viscera.\\n\\nthe nature of the bond of correlation is very frequently quite obscure. m.\\nis. geoffroy st. hilaire has forcibly remarked, that certain\\nmalconformations very frequently, and that others rarely coexist, without\\nour being able to assign any reason. what can be more singular than the\\nrelation between blue eyes and deafness in cats, and the tortoise-shell\\ncolour with the female sex; the feathered feet and skin between the outer\\ntoes in pigeons, and the presence of more or less down on the young birds\\nwhen first hatched, with the future colour of their plumage; or, again, the\\nrelation between the hair and teeth in the naked turkish dog, though here\\nprobably homology comes into play? with respect to this latter case of\\ncorrelation, i think it can hardly be accidental, that if we pick out the\\ntwo orders of mammalia which are most abnormal in their dermal covering,\\nviz. cetacea (whales) and edentata (armadilloes, scaly anteaters, &c.),\\nthat these are likewise the most abnormal in their teeth.\\n\\ni know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of\\ncorrelation in modifying important structures, independently of utility\\nand, therefore, of natural selection, than that of the difference between\\nthe outer and inner flowers in some compositous and umbelliferous plants.\\nevery one knows the {145} difference in the ray and central florets of, for\\ninstance, the daisy, and this difference is often accompanied with the\\nabortion of parts of the flower. but, in some compositous plants, the seeds\\nalso differ in shape and sculpture; and even the ovary itself, with its\\naccessory parts, differs, as has been described by cassini. these\\ndifferences have been attributed by some authors to pressure, and the shape\\nof the seeds in the ray-florets in some compositг¦ countenances this idea;\\nbut, in the case of the corolla of the umbelliferг¦, it is by no means, as\\ndr. hooker informs me, in species with the densest heads that the inner and\\nouter flowers most frequently differ. it might have been thought that the\\ndevelopment of the ray-petals by drawing nourishment from certain other\\nparts of the flower had caused their abortion; but in some compositг¦ there\\nis a difference in the seeds of the outer and inner florets without any\\ndifference in the corolla. possibly, these several differences may be\\nconnected with some difference in the flow of nutriment towards the central\\nand external flowers: we know, at least, that in irregular flowers, those\\nnearest to the axis are oftenest subject to peloria, and become regular. i\\nmay add, as an instance of this, and of a striking case of correlation,\\nthat i have recently observed in some garden pelargoniums, that the central\\nflower of the truss often loses the patches of darker colour in the two\\nupper petals; and that when this occurs, the adherent nectary is quite\\naborted; when the colour is absent from only one of the two upper petals,\\nthe nectary is only much shortened.\\n\\nwith respect to the difference in the corolla of the central and exterior\\nflowers of a head or umbel, i do not feel at all sure that c. c. sprengel\\'s\\nidea that the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly\\nadvantageous in the fertilisation of plants of {146} these two orders, is\\nso far-fetched, as it may at first appear: and if it be advantageous,\\nnatural selection may have come into play. but in regard to the differences\\nboth in the internal and external structure of the seeds, which are not\\nalways correlated with any differences in the flowers, it seems impossible\\nthat they can be in any way advantageous to the plant: yet in the\\numbelliferг¦ these differences are of such apparent importance--the seeds\\nbeing in some cases, according to tausch, orthospermous in the exterior\\nflowers and coelospermous in the central flowers,--that the elder de\\ncandolle founded his main divisions of the order on analogous differences.\\nhence we see that modifications of structure, viewed by systematists as of\\nhigh value, may be wholly due to unknown laws of correlated growth, and\\nwithout being, as far as we can see, of the slightest service to the\\nspecies.\\n\\nwe may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth, structures which\\nare common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are simply due to\\ninheritance; for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural\\nselection some one modification in structure, and, after thousands of\\ngenerations, some other and independent modification; and these two\\nmodifications, having been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with\\ndiverse habits, would naturally be thought to be correlated in some\\nnecessary manner. so, again, i do not doubt that some apparent\\ncorrelations, occurring throughout whole orders, are entirely due to the\\nmanner alone in which natural selection can act. for instance, alph. de\\ncandolle has remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do\\nnot open: i should explain the rule by the fact that seeds could not\\ngradually become winged through natural selection, except in fruits which\\nopened; so that the individual plants producing {147} seeds which were a\\nlittle better fitted to be wafted further, might get an advantage over\\nthose producing seed less fitted for dispersal; and this process could not\\npossibly go on in fruit which did not open.\\n\\nthe elder geoffroy and goethe propounded, at about the same period, their\\nlaw of compensation or balancement of growth; or, as goethe expressed it,\\n\"in order to spend on one side, nature is forced to economise on the other\\nside.\" i think this holds true to a certain extent with our domestic\\nproductions: if nourishment flows to one part or organ in excess, it rarely\\nflows, at least in excess, to another part; thus it is difficult to get a\\ncow to give much milk and to fatten readily. the same varieties of the\\ncabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage and a copious supply\\nof oil-bearing seeds. when the seeds in our fruits become atrophied, the\\nfruit itself gains largely in size and quality. in our poultry, a large\\ntuft of feathers on the head is generally accompanied by a diminished comb,\\nand a large beard by diminished wattles. with species in a state of nature\\nit can hardly be maintained that the law is of universal application; but\\nmany good observers, more especially botanists, believe in its truth. i\\nwill not, however, here give any instances, for i see hardly any way of\\ndistinguishing between the effects, on the one hand, of a part being\\nlargely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining part\\nbeing reduced by this same process or by disuse, and, on the other hand,\\nthe actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of\\ngrowth in another and adjoining part.\\n\\ni suspect, also, that some of the cases of compensation which have been\\nadvanced, and likewise some other facts, may be merged under a more general\\nprinciple, namely, that natural selection is continually trying to\\neconomise in every part of the organisation. if under {148} changed\\nconditions of life a structure before useful becomes less useful, any\\ndiminution, however slight, in its development, will be seized on by\\nnatural selection, for it will profit the individual not to have its\\nnutriment wasted in building up an useless structure. i can thus only\\nunderstand a fact with which i was much struck when examining cirripedes,\\nand of which many other instances could be given: namely, that when a\\ncirripede is parasitic within another and is thus protected, it loses more\\nor less completely its own shell or carapace. this is the case with the\\nmale ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner with the proteolepas: for\\nthe carapace in all other cirripedes consists of the three highly-important\\nanterior segments of the head enormously developed, and furnished with\\ngreat nerves and muscles; but in the parasitic and protected proteolepas,\\nthe whole anterior part of the head is reduced to the merest rudiment\\nattached to the bases of the prehensile antennг¦. now the saving of a large\\nand complex structure, when rendered superfluous by the parasitic habits of\\nthe proteolepas, though effected by slow steps, would be a decided\\nadvantage to each successive individual of the species; for in the struggle\\nfor life to which every animal is exposed, each individual proteolepas\\nwould have a better chance of supporting itself, by less nutriment being\\nwasted in developing a structure now become useless.\\n\\nthus, as i believe, natural selection will always succeed in the long run\\nin reducing and saving every part of the organisation, as soon as it is\\nrendered superfluous, without by any means causing some other part to be\\nlargely developed in a corresponding degree. and, conversely, that natural\\nselection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing any organ,\\nwithout requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of some\\nadjoining part. {149}\\n\\nit seems to be a rule, as remarked by is. geoffroy st. hilaire, both in\\nvarieties and in species, that when any part or organ is repeated many\\ntimes in the structure of the same individual (as the vertebrг¦ in snakes,\\nand the stamens in polyandrous flowers) the number is variable; whereas the\\nnumber of the same part or organ, when it occurs in lesser numbers, is\\nconstant. the same author and some botanists have further remarked that\\nmultiple parts are also very liable to variation in structure. inasmuch as\\nthis \"vegetative repetition,\" to use prof. owen\\'s expression, seems to be a\\nsign of low organisation, the foregoing remark seems connected with the\\nvery general opinion of naturalists, that beings low in the scale of nature\\nare more variable than those which are higher. i presume that lowness in\\nthis case means that the several parts of the organisation have been but\\nlittle specialised for particular functions; and as long as the same part\\nhas to perform diversified work, we can perhaps see why it should remain\\nvariable, that is, why natural selection should have preserved or rejected\\neach little deviation of form less carefully than when the part has to\\nserve for one special purpose alone. in the same way that a knife which has\\nto cut all sorts of things may be of almost any shape; whilst a tool for\\nsome particular object had better be of some particular shape. natural\\nselection, it should never be forgotten, can act on each part of each\\nbeing, solely through and for its advantage.\\n\\nrudimentary parts, it has been stated by some authors, and i believe with\\ntruth, are apt to be highly variable. we shall have to recur to the general\\nsubject of rudimentary and aborted organs; and i will here only add that\\ntheir variability seems to be owing to their uselessness, and therefore to\\nnatural selection having no power to check deviations in their structure.\\nthus {150} rudimentary parts are left to the free play of the various laws\\nof growth, to the effects of long-continued disuse, and to the tendency to\\nreversion.\\n\\n\\n\\n_a part developed in any species in an extraordinary degree or manner, in\\ncomparison with the same part in allied species, tends to be highly\\nvariable._--several years ago i was much struck with a remark, nearly to\\nthe above effect, published by mr. waterhouse. i infer also from an\\nobservation made by professor owen, with respect to the length of the arms\\nof the ourang-outang, that he has come to a nearly similar conclusion. it\\nis hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the truth of this proposition\\nwithout giving the long array of facts which i have collected, and which\\ncannot possibly be here introduced. i can only state my conviction that it\\nis a rule of high generality. i am aware of several causes of error, but i\\nhope that i have made due allowance for them. it should be understood that\\nthe rule by no means applies to any part, however unusually developed,\\nunless it be unusually developed in comparison with the same part in\\nclosely allied species. thus, the bat\\'s wing is a most abnormal structure\\nin the class mammalia; but the rule would not here apply, because there is\\na whole group of bats having wings; it would apply only if some one species\\nof bat had its wings developed in some remarkable manner in comparison with\\nthe other species of the same genus. the rule applies very strongly in the\\ncase of secondary sexual characters, when displayed in any unusual manner.\\nthe term, secondary sexual characters, used by hunter, applies to\\ncharacters which are attached to one sex, but are not directly connected\\nwith the act of reproduction. the rule applies to males and females; but as\\nfemales more rarely offer remarkable secondary sexual characters, it\\napplies {151} more rarely to them. the rule being so plainly applicable in\\nthe case of secondary sexual characters, may be due to the great\\nvariability of these characters, whether or not displayed in any unusual\\nmanner--of which fact i think there can be little doubt. but that our rule\\nis not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case\\nof hermaphrodite cirripedes; and i may here add, that i particularly\\nattended to mr. waterhouse\\'s remark, whilst investigating this order, and i\\nam fully convinced that the rule almost invariably holds good with\\ncirripedes. i shall, in my future work, give a list of the more remarkable\\ncases; i will here only briefly give one, as it illustrates the rule in its\\nlargest application. the opercular valves of sessile cirripedes (rock\\nbarnacles) are, in every sense of the word, very important structures, and\\nthey differ extremely little even in different genera; but in the several\\nspecies of one genus, pyrgoma, these valves present a marvellous amount of\\ndiversification: the homologous valves in the different species being\\nsometimes wholly unlike in shape; and the amount of variation in the\\nindividuals of several of the species is so great, that it is no\\nexaggeration to state that the varieties differ more from each other in the\\ncharacters of these important valves than do other species of distinct\\ngenera.\\n\\nas birds within the same country vary in a remarkably small degree, i have\\nparticularly attended to them, and the rule seems to me certainly to hold\\ngood in this class. i cannot make out that it applies to plants, and this\\nwould seriously have shaken my belief in its truth, had not the great\\nvariability in plants made it particularly difficult to compare their\\nrelative degrees of variability.\\n\\nwhen we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner in\\nany species, the fair {152} presumption is that it is of high importance to\\nthat species; nevertheless the part in this case is eminently liable to\\nvariation. why should this be so? on the view that each species has been\\nindependently created, with all its parts as we now see them, i can see no\\nexplanation. but on the view that groups of species have descended from\\nother species, and have been modified through natural selection, i think we\\ncan obtain some light. in our domestic animals, if any part, or the whole\\nanimal, be neglected and no selection be applied, that part (for instance,\\nthe comb in the dorking fowl) or the whole breed will cease to have a\\nnearly uniform character. the breed will then be said to have degenerated.\\nin rudimentary organs, and in those which have been but little specialised\\nfor any particular purpose, and perhaps in polymorphic groups, we see a\\nnearly parallel natural case; for in such cases natural selection either\\nhas not or cannot come into full play, and thus the organisation is left in\\na fluctuating condition. but what here more especially concerns us is, that\\nin our domestic animals those points, which at the present time are\\nundergoing rapid change by continued selection, are also eminently liable\\nto variation. look at the breeds of the pigeon; see what a prodigious\\namount of difference there is in the beak of the different tumblers, in the\\nbeak and wattle of the different carriers, in the carriage and tail of our\\nfantails, &c., these being the points now mainly attended to by english\\nfanciers. even in the sub-breeds, as in the short-faced tumbler, it is\\nnotoriously difficult to breed them nearly to perfection, and frequently\\nindividuals are born which depart widely from the standard. there may be\\ntruly said to be a constant struggle going on between, on the one hand, the\\ntendency to reversion to a less modified state, as well as an innate\\ntendency to further {153} variability of all kinds, and, on the other hand,\\nthe power of steady selection to keep the breed true. in the long run\\nselection gains the day, and we do not expect to fail so far as to breed a\\nbird as coarse as a common tumbler from a good short-faced strain. but as\\nlong as selection is rapidly going on, there may always be expected to be\\nmuch variability in the structure undergoing modification. it further\\ndeserves notice that these variable characters, produced by man\\'s\\nselection, sometimes become attached, from causes quite unknown to us, more\\nto one sex than to the other, generally to the male sex, as with the wattle\\nof carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters.\\n\\nnow let us turn to nature. when a part has been developed in an\\nextraordinary manner in any one species, compared with the other species of\\nthe same genus, we may conclude that this part has undergone an\\nextraordinary amount of modification since the period when the species\\nbranched off from the common progenitor of the genus. this period will\\nseldom be remote in any extreme degree, as species very rarely endure for\\nmore than one geological period. an extraordinary amount of modification\\nimplies an unusually large and long-continued amount of variability, which\\nhas continually been accumulated by natural selection for the benefit of\\nthe species. but as the variability of the extraordinarily-developed part\\nor organ has been so great and long-continued within a period not\\nexcessively remote, we might, as a general rule, expect still to find more\\nvariability in such parts than in other parts of the organisation which\\nhave remained for a much longer period nearly constant. and this, i am\\nconvinced, is the case. that the struggle between natural selection on the\\none hand, and the tendency to reversion and variability on the other hand,\\nwill in the {154} course of time cease; and that the most abnormally\\ndeveloped organs may be made constant, i can see no reason to doubt. hence\\nwhen an organ, however abnormal it may be, has been transmitted in\\napproximately the same condition to many modified descendants, as in the\\ncase of the wing of the bat, it must have existed, according to my theory,\\nfor an immense period in nearly the same state; and thus it comes to be no\\nmore variable than any other structure. it is only in those cases in which\\nthe modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great\\nthat we ought to find the _generative variability_, as it may be called,\\nstill present in a high degree. for in this case the variability will\\nseldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the individuals\\nvarying in the required manner and degree, and by the continued rejection\\nof those tending to revert to a former and less modified condition.\\n\\nthe principle included in these remarks may be extended. it is notorious\\nthat specific characters are more variable than generic. to explain by a\\nsimple example what is meant. if some species in a large genus of plants\\nhad blue flowers and some had red, the colour would be only a specific\\ncharacter, and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species varying\\ninto red, or conversely; but if all the species had blue flowers, the\\ncolour would become a generic character, and its variation would be a more\\nunusual circumstance. i have chosen this example because an explanation is\\nnot in this case applicable, which most naturalists would advance, namely,\\nthat specific characters are more variable than generic, because they are\\ntaken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly used\\nfor classing genera. i believe this explanation is partly, yet only\\nindirectly, true; i shall, however, have to {155} return to this subject in\\nour chapter on classification. it would be almost superfluous to adduce\\nevidence in support of the above statement, that specific characters are\\nmore variable than generic; but i have repeatedly noticed in works on\\nnatural history, that when an author has remarked with surprise that some\\n_important_ organ or part, which is generally very constant throughout\\nlarge groups of species, has _differed_ considerably in closely-allied\\nspecies, that it has, also, been _variable_ in the individuals of some of\\nthe species. and this fact shows that a character, which is generally of\\ngeneric value, when it sinks in value and becomes only of specific value,\\noften becomes variable, though its physiological importance may remain the\\nsame. something of the same kind applies to monstrosities: at least is.\\ngeoffroy st. hilaire seems to entertain no doubt, that the more an organ\\nnormally differs in the different species of the same group, the more\\nsubject it is to individual anomalies.\\n\\non the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, why\\nshould that part of the structure, which differs from the same part in\\nother independently-created species of the same genus, be more variable\\nthan those parts which are closely alike in the several species? i do not\\nsee that any explanation can be given. but on the view of species being\\nonly strongly marked and fixed varieties, we might surely expect to find\\nthem still often continuing to vary in those parts of their structure which\\nhave varied within a moderately recent period, and which have thus come to\\ndiffer. or to state the case in another manner:--the points in which all\\nthe species of a genus resemble each other, and in which they differ from\\nthe species of some other genus, are called generic characters; and these\\ncharacters in common i attribute to {156} inheritance from a common\\nprogenitor, for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will\\nhave modified several species, fitted to more or less widely-different\\nhabits, in exactly the same manner: and as these so-called generic\\ncharacters have been inherited from a remote period, since that period when\\nthe species first branched off from their common progenitor, and\\nsubsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree, or only in a\\nslight degree, it is not probable that they should vary at the present day.\\non the other hand, the points in which species differ from other species of\\nthe same genus, are called specific characters; and as these specific\\ncharacters have varied and come to differ within the period of the\\nbranching off of the species from a common progenitor, it is probable that\\nthey should still often be in some degree variable,--at least more variable\\nthan those parts of the organisation which have for a very long period\\nremained constant.\\n\\nin connexion with the present subject, i will make only two other remarks.\\ni think it will be admitted, without my entering on details, that secondary\\nsexual characters are very variable; i think it also will be admitted that\\nspecies of the same group differ from each other more widely in their\\nsecondary sexual characters, than in other parts of their organisation;\\ncompare, for instance, the amount of difference between the males of\\ngallinaceous birds, in which secondary sexual characters are strongly\\ndisplayed, with the amount of difference between their females; and the\\ntruth of this proposition will be granted. the cause of the original\\nvariability of secondary sexual characters is not manifest; but we can see\\nwhy these characters should not have been rendered as constant and uniform\\nas other parts of the organisation; for secondary sexual characters have\\nbeen accumulated by sexual selection, which {157} is less rigid in its\\naction than ordinary selection, as it does not entail death, but only gives\\nfewer offspring to the less favoured males. whatever the cause may be of\\nthe variability of secondary sexual characters, as they are highly\\nvariable, sexual selection will have had a wide scope for action, and may\\nthus readily have succeeded in giving to the species of the same group a\\ngreater amount of difference in their sexual characters, than in other\\nparts of their structure.\\n\\nit is a remarkable fact, that the secondary sexual differences between the\\ntwo sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very same\\nparts of the organisation in which the different species of the same genus\\ndiffer from each other. of this fact i will give in illustration two\\ninstances, the first which happen to stand on my list; and as the\\ndifferences in these cases are of a very unusual nature, the relation can\\nhardly be accidental. the same number of joints in the tarsi is a character\\ngenerally common to very large groups of beetles, but in the engidг¦, as\\nwestwood has remarked, the number varies greatly; and the number likewise\\ndiffers in the two sexes of the same species: again in fossorial\\nhymenoptera, the manner of neuration of the wings is a character of the\\nhighest importance, because common to large groups; but in certain genera\\nthe neuration differs in the different species, and likewise in the two\\nsexes of the same species. this relation has a clear meaning on my view of\\nthe subject: i look at all the species of the same genus as having as\\ncertainly descended from the same progenitor, as have the two sexes of any\\none of the species. consequently, whatever part of the structure of the\\ncommon progenitor, or of its early descendants, became variable; variations\\nof this part would, it is highly probable, be taken advantage of by natural\\nand sexual selection, in order to fit {158} the several species to their\\nseveral places in the economy of nature, and likewise to fit the two sexes\\nof the same species to each other, or to fit the males and females to\\ndifferent habits of life, or the males to struggle with other males for the\\npossession of the females.\\n\\nfinally, then, i conclude that the greater variability of specific\\ncharacters, or those which distinguish species from species, than of\\ngeneric characters, or those which the species possess in common;--that the\\nfrequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in a species in\\nan extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part in its congeners;\\nand the slight degree of variability in a part, however extraordinarily it\\nmay be developed, if it be common to a whole group of species;--that the\\ngreat variability of secondary sexual characters, and the great amount of\\ndifference in these same characters between closely allied species;--that\\nsecondary sexual and ordinary specific differences are generally displayed\\nin the same parts of the organisation,--are all principles closely\\nconnected together. all being mainly due to the species of the same group\\nhaving descended from a common progenitor, from whom they have inherited\\nmuch in common,--to parts which have recently and largely varied being more\\nlikely still to go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and\\nhave not varied,--to natural selection having more or less completely,\\naccording to the lapse of time, overmastered the tendency to reversion and\\nto further variability,--to sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary\\nselection,--and to variations in the same parts having been accumulated by\\nnatural and sexual selection, and having been thus adapted for secondary\\nsexual, and for ordinary specific purposes. {159}\\n\\n\\n\\n_distinct species present analogous variations; and a variety of one\\nspecies often assumes some of the characters of an allied species, or\\nreverts to some of the characters of an early progenitor._--these\\npropositions will be most readily understood by looking to our domestic\\nraces. the most distinct breeds of pigeons, in countries most widely apart,\\npresent sub-varieties with reversed feathers on the head and feathers on\\nthe feet,--characters not possessed by the aboriginal rock-pigeon; these\\nthen are analogous variations in two or more distinct races. the frequent\\npresence of fourteen or even sixteen tail-feathers in the pouter, may be\\nconsidered as a variation representing the normal structure of another\\nrace, the fantail. i presume that no one will doubt that all such analogous\\nvariations are due to the several races of the pigeon having inherited from\\na common parent the same constitution and tendency to variation, when acted\\non by similar unknown influences. in the vegetable kingdom we have a case\\nof analogous variation, in the enlarged stems, or roots as commonly called,\\nof the swedish turnip and ruta baga, plants which several botanists tank as\\nvarieties produced by cultivation from a common parent: if this be not so,\\nthe case will then be one of analogous variation in two so-called distinct\\nspecies; and to these a third may be added, namely, the common turnip.\\naccording to the ordinary view of each species having been independently\\ncreated, we should have to attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems\\nof these three plants, not to the _vera causa_ of community of descent, and\\na consequent tendency to vary in a like manner, but to three separate yet\\nclosely related acts of creation.\\n\\nwith pigeons, however, we have another case, namely, the occasional\\nappearance in all the breeds, of slaty-blue birds with two black bars on\\nthe wings, a white {160} rump, a bar at the end of the tail, with the outer\\nfeathers externally edged near their bases with white. as all these marks\\nare characteristic of the parent rock-pigeon, i presume that no one will\\ndoubt that this is a case of reversion, and not of a new yet analogous\\nvariation appearing in the several breeds. we may i think confidently come\\nto this conclusion, because, as we have seen, these coloured marks are\\neminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct and\\ndifferently coloured breeds; and in this case there is nothing in the\\nexternal conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the slaty-blue,\\nwith the several marks, beyond the influence of the mere act of crossing on\\nthe laws of inheritance.\\n\\nno doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear after\\nhaving been lost for many, perhaps for hundreds of generations. but when a\\nbreed has been crossed only once by some other breed, the offspring\\noccasionally show a tendency to revert in character to the foreign breed\\nfor many generations--some say, for a dozen or even a score of generations.\\nafter twelve generations, the proportion of blood, to use a common\\nexpression, of any one ancestor, is only 1 in 2048; and yet, as we see, it\\nis generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained by this very\\nsmall proportion of foreign blood. in a breed which has not been crossed,\\nbut in which _both_ parents have lost some character which their progenitor\\npossessed, the tendency, whether strong or weak, to reproduce the lost\\ncharacter might be, as was formerly remarked, for all that we can see to\\nthe contrary, transmitted for almost any number of generations. when a\\ncharacter which has been lost in a breed, reappears after a great number of\\ngenerations, the most probable hypothesis is, not that the offspring\\nsuddenly takes after an ancestor some hundred generations {161} distant,\\nbut that in each successive generation there has been a tendency to\\nreproduce the character in question, which at last, under unknown\\nfavourable conditions, gains an ascendancy. for instance, it is probable\\nthat in each generation of the barb-pigeon, which produces most rarely a\\nblue and black-barred bird, there has been a tendency in each generation in\\nthe plumage to assume this colour. this view is hypothetical, but could be\\nsupported by some facts; and i can see no more abstract improbability in a\\ntendency to produce any character being inherited for an endless number of\\ngenerations, than in quite useless or rudimentary organs being, as we all\\nknow them to be, thus inherited. indeed, we may sometimes observe a mere\\ntendency to produce a rudiment inherited: for instance, in the common\\nsnapdragon (antirrhinum) a rudiment of a fifth stamen so often appears,\\nthat this plant must have an inherited tendency to produce it.\\n\\nas all the species of the same genus are supposed, on my theory, to have\\ndescended from a common parent, it might be expected that they would\\noccasionally vary in an analogous manner; so that a variety of one species\\nwould resemble in some of its characters another species; this other\\nspecies being on my view only a well-marked and permanent variety. but\\ncharacters thus gained would probably be of an unimportant nature, for the\\npresence of all important characters will be governed by natural selection,\\nin accordance with the diverse habits of the species, and will not be left\\nto the mutual action of the conditions of life and of a similar inherited\\nconstitution. it might further be expected that the species of the same\\ngenus would occasionally exhibit reversions to lost ancestral characters.\\nas, however, we never know the exact character of the common ancestor of a\\ngroup, we could not distinguish these two {162} cases: if, for instance, we\\ndid not know that the rock-pigeon was not feather-footed or turn-crowned,\\nwe could not have told, whether these characters in our domestic breeds\\nwere reversions or only analogous variations; but we might have inferred\\nthat the blueness was a case of reversion, from the number of the markings,\\nwhich are correlated with the blue tint, and which it does not appear\\nprobable would all appear together from simple variation. more especially\\nwe might have inferred this, from the blue colour and marks so often\\nappearing when distinct breeds of diverse colours are crossed. hence,\\nthough under nature it must generally be left doubtful, what cases are\\nreversions to an anciently existing character, and what are new but\\nanalogous variations, yet we ought, on my theory, sometimes to find the\\nvarying offspring of a species assuming characters (either from reversion\\nor from analogous variation) which already occur in some other members of\\nthe same group. and this undoubtedly is the case in nature.\\n\\na considerable part of the difficulty in recognising a variable species in\\nour systematic works, is due to its varieties mocking, as it were, some of\\nthe other species of the same genus. a considerable catalogue, also, could\\nbe given of forms intermediate between two other forms, which themselves\\nmust be doubtfully ranked as either varieties or species; and this shows,\\nunless all these forms be considered as independently created species, that\\nthe one in varying has assumed some of the characters of the other, so as\\nto produce the intermediate form. but the best evidence is afforded by\\nparts or organs of an important and uniform nature occasionally varying so\\nas to acquire, in some degree, the character of the same part or organ in\\nan allied species. i have collected a long list of such cases; but {163}\\nhere, as before, i lie under a great disadvantage in not being able to give\\nthem. i can only repeat that such cases certainly do occur, and seem to me\\nvery remarkable.\\n\\ni will, however, give one curious and complex case, not indeed as affecting\\nany important character, but from occurring in several species of the same\\ngenus, partly under domestication and partly under nature. it is a case\\napparently of reversion. the ass not rarely has very distinct transverse\\nbars on its legs, like those on the legs of the zebra: it has been asserted\\nthat these are plainest in the foal, and from inquiries which i have made,\\ni believe this to be true. it has also been asserted that the stripe on\\neach shoulder is sometimes double. the shoulder-stripe is certainly very\\nvariable in length and outline. a white ass, but _not_ an albino, has been\\ndescribed without either spinal or shoulder stripe; and these stripes are\\nsometimes very obscure, or actually quite lost, in dark-coloured asses. the\\nkoulan of pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulder-stripe.\\nthe hemionus has no shoulder-stripe; but traces of it, as stated by mr.\\nblyth and others, occasionally appear: and i have been informed by colonel\\npoole that the foals of this species are generally striped on the legs, and\\nfaintly on the shoulder. the quagga, though so plainly barred like a zebra\\nover the body, is without bars on the legs; but dr. gray has figured one\\nspecimen with very distinct zebra-like bars on the hocks.\\n\\nwith respect to the horse, i have collected cases in england of the spinal\\nstripe in horses of the most distinct breeds, and of _all_ colours;\\ntransverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns, mouse-duns, and in one\\ninstance in a chestnut: a faint shoulder-stripe may sometimes be seen in\\nduns, and i have seen a trace in a {164} bay horse. my son made a careful\\nexamination and sketch for me of a dun belgian cart-horse with a double\\nstripe on each shoulder and with leg-stripes; and a man, whom i can\\nimplicitly trust, has examined for me a small dun welch pony with _three_\\nshort parallel stripes on each shoulder.\\n\\nin the north-west part of india the kattywar breed of horses is so\\ngenerally striped, that, as i hear from colonel poole, who examined the\\nbreed for the indian government, a horse without stripes is not considered\\nas purely-bred. the spine is always striped; the legs are generally barred;\\nand the shoulder-stripe, which is sometimes double and sometimes treble, is\\ncommon; the side of the face, moreover, is sometimes striped. the stripes\\nare plainest in the foal; and sometimes quite disappear in old horses.\\ncolonel poole has seen both gray and bay kattywar horses striped when first\\nfoaled. i have, also, reason to suspect, from information given me by mr.\\nw. w. edwards, that with the english racehorse the spinal stripe is much\\ncommoner in the foal than in the full-grown animal. without here entering\\non further details, i may state that i have collected cases of leg and\\nshoulder stripes in horses of very different breeds, in various countries\\nfrom britain to eastern china; and from norway in the north to the malay\\narchipelago in the south. in all parts of the world these stripes occur far\\noftenest in duns and mouse-duns; by the term dun a large range of colour is\\nincluded, from one between brown and black to a close approach to\\ncream-colour.\\n\\ni am aware that colonel hamilton smith, who has written on this subject,\\nbelieves that the several breeds of the horse have descended from several\\naboriginal species--one of which, the dun, was striped; and that the\\nabove-described appearances are all due to ancient {165} crosses with the\\ndun stock. but i am not at all satisfied with this theory, and should be\\nloth to apply it to breeds so distinct as the heavy belgian cart-horse,\\nwelch ponies, cobs, the lanky kattywar race, &c., inhabiting the most\\ndistant parts of the world.\\n\\nnow let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the\\nhorse-genus. rollin asserts, that the common mule from the ass and horse is\\nparticularly apt to have bars on its legs: according to mr. gosse, in\\ncertain parts of the united states about nine out of ten mules have striped\\nlegs. i once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any one would at\\nfirst have thought that it must have been the product of a zebra; and mr.\\nw. c. martin, in his excellent treatise on the horse, has given a figure of\\na similar mule. in four coloured drawings, which i have seen, of hybrids\\nbetween the ass and zebra, the legs were much more plainly barred than the\\nrest of the body; and in one of them there was a double shoulder-stripe. in\\nlord morton\\'s famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga, the\\nhybrid, and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by\\na black arabian sire, were much more plainly barred across the legs than is\\neven the pure quagga. lastly, and this is another most remarkable case, a\\nhybrid has been figured by dr. gray (and he informs me that he knows of a\\nsecond case) from the ass and the hemionus; and this hybrid, though the ass\\nseldom has stripes on his legs and the hemionus has none and has not even a\\nshoulder-stripe, nevertheless had all four legs barred, and had three short\\nshoulder-stripes, like those on the dun welch pony, and even had some\\nzebra-like stripes on the sides of its face. with respect to this last\\nfact, i was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears from what\\nwould commonly be called an {166} accident, that i was led solely from the\\noccurrence of the face-stripes on this hybrid from the ass and hemionus to\\nask colonel poole whether such face-stripes ever occur in the eminently\\nstriped kattywar breed of horses, and was, as we have seen, answered in the\\naffirmative.\\n\\nwhat now are we to say to these several facts? we see several very distinct\\nspecies of the horse-genus becoming, by simple variation, striped on the\\nlegs like a zebra, or striped on the shoulders like an ass. in the horse we\\nsee this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appears--a tint which\\napproaches to that of the general colouring of the other species of the\\ngenus. the appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change of\\nform or by any other new character. we see this tendency to become striped\\nmost strongly displayed in hybrids from between several of the most\\ndistinct species. now observe the case of the several breeds of pigeons:\\nthey are descended from a pigeon (including two or three sub-species or\\ngeographical races) of a bluish colour, with certain bars and other marks;\\nand when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish tint, these bars\\nand other marks invariably reappear; but without any other change of form\\nor character. when the oldest and truest breeds of various colours are\\ncrossed, we see a strong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to\\nreappear in the mongrels. i have stated that the most probable hypothesis\\nto account for the reappearance of very ancient characters, is--that there\\nis a _tendency_ in the young of each successive generation to produce the\\nlong-lost character, and that this tendency, from unknown causes, sometimes\\nprevails. and we have just seen that in several species of the horse-genus\\nthe stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly in the young than in\\nthe old. call the breeds of pigeons, some of which have bred true for {167}\\ncenturies, species; and how exactly parallel is the case with that of the\\nspecies of the horse-genus! for myself, i venture confidently to look back\\nthousands on thousands of generations, and i see an animal striped like a\\nzebra, but perhaps otherwise very differently constructed, the common\\nparent of our domestic horse, whether or not it be descended from one or\\nmore wild stocks, of the ass, the hemionus, quagga, and zebra.\\n\\nhe who believes that each equine species was independently created, will, i\\npresume, assert that each species has been created with a tendency to vary,\\nboth under nature and under domestication, in this particular manner, so as\\noften to become striped like other species of the genus; and that each has\\nbeen created with a strong tendency, when crossed with species inhabiting\\ndistant quarters of the world, to produce hybrids resembling in their\\nstripes, not their own parents, but other species of the genus. to admit\\nthis view is, as it seems to me, to reject a real for an unreal, or at\\nleast for an unknown, cause. it makes the works of god a mere mockery and\\ndeception; i would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant\\ncosmogonists, that fossil shells had never lived, but had been created in\\nstone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea-shore.\\n\\n\\n\\n_summary._--our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound. not in one\\ncase out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that\\npart differs, more or less, from the same part in the parents. but whenever\\nwe have the means of instituting a comparison, the same laws appear to have\\nacted in producing the lesser differences between varieties of the same\\nspecies, and the greater differences between species of the same genus. the\\nexternal conditions of life, as {168} climate and food, &c., seem to have\\ninduced some slight modifications. habit in producing constitutional\\ndifferences, and use in strengthening and disuse in weakening and\\ndiminishing organs, seem to have been more potent in their effects.\\nhomologous parts tend to vary in the same way, and homologous parts tend to\\ncohere. modifications in hard parts and in external parts sometimes affect\\nsofter and internal parts. when one part is largely developed, perhaps it\\ntends to draw nourishment from the adjoining parts; and every part of the\\nstructure which can be saved without detriment to the individual, will be\\nsaved. changes of structure at an early age will generally affect parts\\nsubsequently developed; and there are very many other correlations of\\ngrowth, the nature of which we are utterly unable to understand. multiple\\nparts are variable in number and in structure, perhaps arising from such\\nparts not having been closely specialised to any particular function, so\\nthat their modifications have not been closely checked by natural\\nselection. it is probably from this same cause that organic beings low in\\nthe scale of nature are more variable than those which have their whole\\norganisation more specialised, and are higher in the scale. rudimentary\\norgans, from being useless, will be disregarded by natural selection, and\\nhence probably are variable. specific characters--that is, the characters\\nwhich have come to differ since the several species of the same genus\\nbranched off from a common parent--are more variable than generic\\ncharacters, or those which have long been inherited, and have not differed\\nwithin this same period. in these remarks we have referred to special parts\\nor organs being still variable, because they have recently varied and thus\\ncome to differ; but we have also seen in the second chapter that the same\\nprinciple applies to the whole individual; {169} for in a district where\\nmany species of any genus are found--that is, where there has been much\\nformer variation and differentiation, or where the manufactory of new\\nspecific forms has been actively at work--there, on an average, we now find\\nmost varieties or incipient species. secondary sexual characters are highly\\nvariable, and such characters differ much in the species of the same group.\\nvariability in the same parts of the organisation has generally been taken\\nadvantage of in giving secondary sexual differences to the sexes of the\\nsame species, and specific differences to the several species of the same\\ngenus. any part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an\\nextraordinary manner, in comparison with the same part or organ in the\\nallied species, must have gone through an extraordinary amount of\\nmodification since the genus arose; and thus we can understand why it\\nshould often still be variable in a much higher degree than other parts;\\nfor variation is a long-continued and slow process, and natural selection\\nwill in such cases not as yet have had time to overcome the tendency to\\nfurther variability and to reversion to a less modified state. but when a\\nspecies with any extraordinarily-developed organ has become the parent of\\nmany modified descendants--which on my view must be a very slow process,\\nrequiring a long lapse of time--in this case, natural selection may readily\\nhave succeeded in giving a fixed character to the organ, in however\\nextraordinary a manner it may be developed. species inheriting nearly the\\nsame constitution from a common parent and exposed to similar influences\\nwill naturally tend to present analogous variations, and these same species\\nmay occasionally revert to some of the characters of their ancient\\nprogenitors. although new and important modifications may not arise from\\nreversion and analogous {170} variation, such modifications will add to the\\nbeautiful and harmonious diversity of nature.\\n\\nwhatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from\\ntheir parents--and a cause for each must exist--it is the steady\\naccumulation, through natural selection, of such differences, when\\nbeneficial to the individual, that gives rise to all the more important\\nmodifications of structure, by which the innumerable beings on the face of\\nthis earth are enabled to struggle with each other, and the best adapted to\\nsurvive.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{171}\\n\\nchapter vi.\\n\\ndifficulties on

selection.\\n\\nlong before having arrived at this part of my work, a crowd of difficulties\\nwill have occurred to the reader. some of them are so grave that to this\\nday i can never reflect on them without being staggered; but, to the best\\nof my judgment, the greater number are only apparent, and those that are\\nreal are not, i think, fatal to my theory.\\n\\nthese difficulties and objections may be classed under the following\\nheads:--firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by\\ninsensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable\\ntransitional forms? why is not all nature in confusion instead of the\\nspecies being, as we see them, well defined?\\n\\nsecondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the structure\\nand habits of a bat, could have been formed by the modification of some\\nanimal with wholly different habits? can we believe that natural selection\\ncould produce, on the one hand, organs of trifling importance, such as the\\ntail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand,\\norgans of {172} such wonderful structure, as the eye, of which we hardly as\\nyet fully understand the inimitable perfection?\\n\\nthirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural selection?\\nwhat shall we say to so marvellous an instinct as that which leads the bee\\nto make cells, which has practically anticipated the discoveries of\\nprofound mathematicians?\\n\\nfourthly, how can we account for species, when crossed, being sterile and\\nproducing sterile offspring, whereas, when varieties are crossed, their\\nfertility is unimpaired?\\n\\nthe two first heads shall be here discussed--instinct and hybridism in\\nseparate chapters.\\n\\n\\n\\n_on the absence or rarity of transitional varieties._--as natural selection\\nacts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications, each new form\\nwill tend in a fully-stocked country to take the place of, and finally to\\nexterminate, its own less improved parent or other less-favoured forms with\\nwhich it comes into competition. thus extinction and natural selection\\nwill, as we have seen, go hand in hand. hence, if we look at each species\\nas descended from some other unknown form, both the parent and all the\\ntransitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very\\nprocess of formation and perfection of the new form.\\n\\nbut, as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed,\\nwhy do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the\\nearth? it will be much more convenient to discuss this question in the\\nchapter on the imperfection of the geological record; and i will here only\\nstate that i believe the answer mainly lies in the record being\\nincomparably less perfect than is generally supposed; the imperfection of\\nthe record being chiefly due to organic beings not inhabiting {173}\\nprofound depths of the sea, and to their remains being embedded and\\npreserved to a future age only in masses of sediment sufficiently thick and\\nextensive to withstand an enormous amount of future degradation; and such\\nfossiliferous masses can be accumulated only where much sediment is\\ndeposited on the shallow bed of the sea, whilst it slowly subsides. these\\ncontingencies will concur only rarely, and after enormously long intervals.\\nwhilst the bed of the sea is stationary or is rising, or when very little\\nsediment is being deposited, there will be blanks in our geological\\nhistory. the crust of the earth is a vast museum; but the natural\\ncollections have been made only at intervals of time immensely remote.\\n\\nbut it may be urged that when several closely-allied species inhabit the\\nsame territory we surely ought to find at the present time many\\ntransitional forms. let us take a simple case: in travelling from north to\\nsouth over a continent, we generally meet at successive intervals with\\nclosely allied or representative species, evidently filling nearly the same\\nplace in the natural economy of the land. these representative species\\noften meet and interlock; and as the one becomes rarer and rarer, the other\\nbecomes more and more frequent, till the one replaces the other. but if we\\ncompare these species where they intermingle, they are generally as\\nabsolutely distinct from each other in every detail of structure as are\\nspecimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each. by my theory these\\nallied species have descended from a common parent; and during the process\\nof modification, each has become adapted to the conditions of life of its\\nown region, and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent and all\\nthe transitional varieties between its past and present states. hence we\\nought not to expect at the {174} present time to meet with numerous\\ntransitional varieties in each region, though they must have existed there,\\nand may be embedded there in a fossil condition. but in the intermediate\\nregion, having intermediate conditions of life, why do we not now find\\nclosely-linking intermediate varieties? this difficulty for a long time\\nquite confounded me. but i think it can be in large part explained.\\n\\nin the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring, because an\\narea is now continuous, that it has been continuous during a long period.\\ngeology would lead us to believe that almost every continent has been\\nbroken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods; and in such\\nislands distinct species might have been separately formed without the\\npossibility of intermediate varieties existing in the intermediate zones.\\nby changes in the form of the land and of climate, marine areas now\\ncontinuous must often have existed within recent times in a far less\\ncontinuous and uniform condition than at present. but i will pass over this\\nway of escaping from the difficulty; for i believe that many perfectly\\ndefined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas; though i do\\nnot doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas now continuous has\\nplayed an important part in the formation of new species, more especially\\nwith freely-crossing and wandering animals.\\n\\nin looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area, we\\ngenerally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory, then\\nbecoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines, and finally\\ndisappearing. hence the neutral territory between two representative\\nspecies is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to\\neach. we see the same fact in ascending mountains, and sometimes {175} it\\nis quite remarkable how abruptly, as alph. de candolle has observed, a\\ncommon alpine species disappears. the same fact has been noticed by e.\\nforbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge. to those who look\\nat climate and the physical conditions of life as the all-important\\nelements of distribution, these facts ought to cause surprise, as climate\\nand height or depth graduate away insensibly. but when we bear in mind that\\nalmost every species, even in its metropolis, would increase immensely in\\nnumbers, were it not for other competing species; that nearly all either\\nprey on or serve as prey for others; in short, that each organic being is\\neither directly or indirectly related in the most important manner to other\\norganic beings, we must see that the range of the inhabitants of any\\ncountry by no means exclusively depends on insensibly changing physical\\nconditions, but in large part on the presence of other species, on which it\\ndepends, or by which it is destroyed, or with which it comes into\\ncompetition; and as these species are already defined objects (however they\\nmay have become so), not blending one into another by insensible\\ngradations, the range of any one species, depending as it does on the range\\nof others, will tend to be sharply defined. moreover, each species on the\\nconfines of its range, where it exists in lessened numbers, will, during\\nfluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey, or in the\\nseasons, be extremely liable to utter extermination; and thus its\\ngeographical range will come to be still more sharply defined.\\n\\nif i am right in believing that allied or representative species, when\\ninhabiting a continuous area, are generally so distributed that each has a\\nwide range, with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them, in\\nwhich they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer; then, as varieties do\\nnot essentially differ from species, {176} the same rule will probably\\napply to both; and if we in imagination adapt a varying species to a very\\nlarge area, we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a\\nthird variety to a narrow intermediate zone. the intermediate variety,\\nconsequently, will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and\\nlesser area; and practically, as far as i can make out, this rule holds\\ngood with varieties in a state of nature. i have met with striking\\ninstances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between\\nwell-marked varieties in the genus balanus. and it would appear from\\ninformation given me by mr. watson, dr. asa gray, and mr. wollaston, that\\ngenerally when varieties intermediate between two other forms occur, they\\nare much rarer numerically than the forms which they connect. now, if we\\nmay trust these facts and inferences, and therefore conclude that varieties\\nlinking two other varieties together have generally existed in lesser\\nnumbers than the forms which they connect, then, i think, we can understand\\nwhy intermediate varieties should not endure for very long periods;--why as\\na general rule they should be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the\\nforms which they originally linked together.\\n\\nfor any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked, run a\\ngreater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers;\\nand in this particular case the intermediate form would be eminently liable\\nto the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both sides of it. but a\\nfar more important consideration, as i believe, is that, during the process\\nof further modification, by which two varieties are supposed on my theory\\nto be converted and perfected into two distinct species, the two which\\nexist in larger numbers from inhabiting larger areas, will have a great\\nadvantage over the intermediate variety, which exists {177} in smaller\\nnumbers in a narrow and intermediate zone. for forms existing in larger\\nnumbers will always have a better chance, within any given period, of\\npresenting further favourable variations for natural selection to seize on,\\nthan will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers. hence, the more\\ncommon forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the less\\ncommon forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved. it is\\nthe same principle which, as i believe, accounts for the common species in\\neach country, as shown in the second chapter, presenting on an average a\\ngreater number of well-marked varieties than do the rarer species. i may\\nillustrate what i mean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept,\\none adapted to an extensive mountainous region; a second to a comparatively\\nnarrow, hilly tract; and a third to wide plains at the base; and that the\\ninhabitants are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their\\nstocks by selection; the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of\\nthe great holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds\\nmore quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow, hilly\\ntract; and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soon take\\nthe place of the less improved hill breed; and thus the two breeds, which\\noriginally existed in greater numbers, will come into close contact with\\neach other, without the interposition of the supplanted, intermediate\\nhill-variety.\\n\\nto sum up, i believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined\\nobjects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of\\nvarying and intermediate links: firstly, because new varieties are very\\nslowly formed, for variation is a very slow process, and natural selection\\ncan do nothing until favourable {178} variations chance to occur, and until\\na place in the natural polity of the country can be better filled by some\\nmodification of some one or more of its inhabitants. and such new places\\nwill depend on slow changes of climate, or on the occasional immigration of\\nnew inhabitants, and, probably, in a still more important degree, on some\\nof the old inhabitants becoming slowly modified, with the new forms thus\\nproduced and the old ones acting and reacting on each other. so that, in\\nany one region and at any one time, we ought only to see a few species\\npresenting slight modifications of structure in some degree permanent; and\\nthis assuredly we do see.\\n\\nsecondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the recent\\nperiod in isolated portions, in which many forms, more especially amongst\\nthe classes which unite for each birth and wander much, may have separately\\nbeen rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative species. in\\nthis case, intermediate varieties between the several representative\\nspecies and their common parent, must formerly have existed in each broken\\nportion of the land, but these links will have been supplanted and\\nexterminated during the process of natural selection, so that they will no\\nlonger exist in a living state.\\n\\nthirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different portions\\nof a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will, it is probable,\\nat first have been formed in the intermediate zones, but they will\\ngenerally have had a short duration. for these intermediate varieties will,\\nfrom reasons already assigned (namely from what we know of the actual\\ndistribution of closely allied or representative species, and likewise of\\nacknowledged varieties), exist in the intermediate zones in lesser numbers\\nthan the varieties which they {179} tend to connect. from this cause alone\\nthe intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental extermination; and\\nduring the process of further modification through natural selection, they\\nwill almost certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they\\nconnect; for these from existing in greater numbers will, in the aggregate,\\npresent more variation, and thus be further improved through natural\\nselection and gain further advantages.\\n\\nlastly, looking not to any one time, but to all time, if my theory be true,\\nnumberless intermediate varieties, linking most closely all the species of\\nthe same group together, must assuredly have existed; but the very process\\nof natural selection constantly tends, as has been so often remarked, to\\nexterminate the parent-forms and the intermediate links. consequently\\nevidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil\\nremains, which are preserved, as we shall in a future chapter attempt to\\nshow, in an extremely imperfect and intermittent record.\\n\\n\\n\\n_on the origin and transitions of organic beings with peculiar habits and\\nstructure._--it has been asked by the opponents of such views as i hold,\\nhow, for instance, a land carnivorous animal could have been converted into\\none with aquatic habits; for how could the animal in its transitional state\\nhave subsisted? it would be easy to show that within the same group\\ncarnivorous animals exist having every intermediate grade between truly\\naquatic and strictly terrestrial habits; and as each exists by a struggle\\nfor life, it is clear that each is well adapted in its habits to its place\\nin nature. look at the mustela vison of north america, which has webbed\\nfeet and which resembles an otter in its fur, short legs, and form of tail;\\nduring summer this animal {180} dives for and preys on fish, but during the\\nlong winter it leaves the frozen waters, and preys like other polecats on\\nmice and land animals. if a different case had been taken, and it had been\\nasked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted\\ninto a flying bat, the question would have been far more difficult, and i\\ncould have given no answer. yet i think such difficulties have very little\\nweight.\\n\\nhere, as on other occasions, i lie under a heavy disadvantage, for out of\\nthe many striking cases which i have collected, i can give only one or two\\ninstances of transitional habits and structures in closely allied species\\nof the same genus; and of diversified habits, either constant or\\noccasional, in the same species. and it seems to me that nothing less than\\na long list of such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in any\\nparticular case like that of the bat.\\n\\nlook at the family of squirrels; here we have the finest gradation from\\nanimals with their tails only slightly flattened, and from others, as sir\\nj. richardson has remarked, with the posterior part of their bodies rather\\nwide and with the skin on their flanks rather full, to the so-called flying\\nsquirrels; and flying squirrels have their limbs and even the base of the\\ntail united by a broad expanse of skin, which serves as a parachute and\\nallows them to glide through the air to an astonishing distance from tree\\nto tree. we cannot doubt that each structure is of use to each kind of\\nsquirrel in its own country, by enabling it to escape birds or beasts of\\nprey, or to collect food more quickly, or, as there is reason to believe,\\nby lessening the danger from occasional falls. but it does not follow from\\nthis fact that the structure of each squirrel is the best that it is\\npossible to conceive under all natural conditions. let the climate and\\nvegetation change, let other competing {181} rodents or new beasts of prey\\nimmigrate, or old ones become modified, and all analogy would lead us to\\nbelieve that some at least of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or\\nbecome exterminated, unless they also became modified and improved in\\nstructure in a corresponding manner. therefore, i can see no difficulty,\\nmore especially under changing conditions of life, in the continued\\npreservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flank-membranes, each\\nmodification being useful, each being propagated, until by the accumulated\\neffects of this process of natural selection, a perfect so-called flying\\nsquirrel was produced.\\n\\nnow look at the galeopithecus or flying lemur, which formerly was falsely\\nranked amongst bats. it has an extremely wide flank-membrane, stretching\\nfrom the corners of the jaw to the tail, and including the limbs and the\\nelongated fingers: the flank-membrane is, also, furnished with an extensor\\nmuscle. although no graduated links of structure, fitted for gliding\\nthrough the air, now connect the galeopithecus with the other lemuridг¦, yet\\ni see no difficulty in supposing that such links formerly existed, and that\\neach had been formed by the same steps as in the case of the less perfectly\\ngliding squirrels; and that each grade of structure was useful to its\\npossessor. nor can i see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it\\npossible that the membrane-connected fingers and forearm of the\\ngaleopithecus might be greatly lengthened by natural selection; and this,\\nas far as the organs of flight are concerned, would convert it into a bat.\\nin bats which have the wing-membrane extended from the top of the shoulder\\nto the tail, including the hind-legs, we perhaps see traces of an apparatus\\noriginally constructed for gliding through the air rather than for flight.\\n{182}\\n\\nif about a dozen genera of birds had become extinct or were unknown, who\\nwould have ventured to have surmised that birds might have existed which\\nused their wings solely as flappers, like the logger-headed duck\\n(micropterus of eyton); as fins in the water and front legs on the land,\\nlike the penguin; as sails, like the ostrich; and functionally for no\\npurpose, like the apteryx. yet the structure of each of these birds is good\\nfor it, under the conditions of life to which it is exposed, for each has\\nto live by a struggle; but it is not necessarily the best possible under\\nall possible conditions. it must not be inferred from these remarks that\\nany of the grades of wing-structure here alluded to, which perhaps may all\\nhave resulted from disuse, indicate the natural steps by which birds have\\nacquired their perfect power of flight; but they serve, at least, to show\\nwhat diversified means of transition are possible.\\n\\nseeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the crustacea\\nand mollusca are adapted to live on the land; and seeing that we have\\nflying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most diversified types, and\\nformerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable that flying-fish, which now\\nglide far through the air, slightly rising and turning by the aid of their\\nfluttering fins, might have been modified into perfectly winged animals. if\\nthis had been effected, who would have ever imagined that in an early\\ntransitional state they had been inhabitants of the open ocean, and had\\nused their incipient organs of flight exclusively, as far as we know, to\\nescape being devoured by other fish?\\n\\nwhen we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit, as the\\nwings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that animals displaying\\nearly {183} transitional grades of the structure will seldom continue to\\nexist to the present day, for they will have been supplanted by the very\\nprocess of perfection through natural selection. furthermore, we may\\nconclude that transitional grades between structures fitted for very\\ndifferent habits of life will rarely have been developed at an early period\\nin great numbers and under many subordinate forms. thus, to return to our\\nimaginary illustration of the flying-fish, it does not seem probable that\\nfishes capable of true flight would have been developed under many\\nsubordinate forms, for taking prey of many kinds in many ways, on the land\\nand in the water, until their organs of flight had come to a high stage of\\nperfection, so as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals\\nin the battle for life. hence the chance of discovering species with\\ntransitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always be less,\\nfrom their having existed in lesser numbers, than in the case of species\\nwith fully developed structures.\\n\\ni will now give two or three instances of diversified and of changed habits\\nin the individuals of the same species. when either case occurs, it would\\nbe easy for natural selection to fit the animal, by some modification of\\nits structure, for its changed habits, or exclusively for one of its\\nseveral different habits. but it is difficult to tell, and immaterial for\\nus, whether habits generally change first and structure afterwards; or\\nwhether slight modifications of structure lead to changed habits; both\\nprobably often change almost simultaneously. of cases of changed habits it\\nwill suffice merely to allude to that of the many british insects which now\\nfeed on exotic plants, or exclusively on artificial substances. of\\ndiversified habits innumerable instances could be given: i have often\\nwatched a tyrant flycatcher (saurophagus sulphuratus) in south america,\\nhovering over one spot {184} and then proceeding to another, like a\\nkestrel, and at other times standing stationary on the margin of water, and\\nthen dashing like a kingfisher at a fish. in our own country the larger\\ntitmouse (parus major) may be seen climbing branches, almost like a\\ncreeper; it often, like a shrike, kills small birds by blows on the head;\\nand i have many times seen and heard it hammering the seeds of the yew on a\\nbranch, and thus breaking them like a nuthatch. in north america the black\\nbear was seen by hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth, thus\\ncatching, almost like a whale, insects in the water.\\n\\nas we sometimes see individuals of a species following habits widely\\ndifferent from those of their own species and of the other species of the\\nsame genus, we might expect, on my theory, that such individuals would\\noccasionally have given rise to new species, having anomalous habits, and\\nwith their structure either slightly or considerably modified from that of\\ntheir proper type. and such instances do occur in nature. can a more\\nstriking instance of adaptation be given than that of a woodpecker for\\nclimbing trees and for seizing insects in the chinks of the bark? yet in\\nnorth america there are woodpeckers which feed largely on fruit, and others\\nwith elongated wings which chase insects on the wing; and on the plains of\\nla plata, where not a tree grows, there is a woodpecker, which in every\\nessential part of its organisation, even in its colouring, in the harsh\\ntone of its voice, and undulatory flight, told me plainly of its close\\nblood-relationship to our common species; yet it is a woodpecker which\\nnever climbs a tree!\\n\\npetrels are the most aг«rial and oceanic of birds, yet in the quiet sounds\\nof tierra del fuego, the puffinuria berardi, in its general habits, in its\\nastonishing power of diving, its manner of swimming, and of flying when\\n{185} unwillingly it takes flight, would be mistaken by any one for an auk\\nor grebe; nevertheless, it is essentially a petrel, but with many parts of\\nits organisation profoundly modified. on the other hand, the acutest\\nobserver by examining the dead body of the water-ouzel would never have\\nsuspected its sub-aquatic habits; yet this anomalous member of the strictly\\nterrestrial thrush family wholly subsists by diving,--grasping the stones\\nwith its feet and using its wings under water.\\n\\nhe who believes that each being has been created as we now see it, must\\noccasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having\\nhabits and structure not at all in agreement. what can be plainer than that\\nthe webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming? yet there are\\nupland geese with webbed feet which rarely or never go near the water; and\\nno one except audubon has seen the frigate-bird, which has all its four\\ntoes webbed, alight on the surface of the sea. on the other hand grebes and\\ncoots are eminently aquatic, although their toes are only bordered by\\nmembrane. what seems plainer than that the long toes of grallatores are\\nformed for walking over swamps and floating plants, yet the water-hen is\\nnearly as aquatic as the coot; and the landrail nearly as terrestrial as\\nthe quail or partridge. in such cases, and many others could be given,\\nhabits have changed without a corresponding change of structure. the webbed\\nfeet of the upland goose may be said to have become rudimentary in\\nfunction, though not in structure. in the frigate-bird, the deeply-scooped\\nmembrane between the toes shows that structure has begun to change.\\n\\nhe who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation will say, that\\nin these cases it has pleased the creator to cause a being of one type to\\ntake the place of one of another type; but this seems to me only {186}\\nrestating the fact in dignified language. he who believes in the struggle\\nfor existence and in the principle of natural selection, will acknowledge\\nthat every organic being is constantly endeavouring to increase in numbers;\\nand that if any one being vary ever so little, either in habits or\\nstructure, and thus gain an advantage over some other inhabitant of the\\ncountry, it will seize on the place of that inhabitant, however different\\nit may be from its own place. hence it will cause him no surprise that\\nthere should be geese and frigate-birds with webbed feet, living on the dry\\nland or most rarely alighting on the water; that there should be long-toed\\ncorncrakes living in meadows instead of in swamps; that there should be\\nwoodpeckers where not a tree grows; that there should be diving thrushes,\\nand petrels with the habits of auks.\\n\\n\\n\\n_organs of extreme perfection and complication._--to suppose that the eye,\\nwith all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different\\ndistances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction\\nof spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural\\nselection, seems, i freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.\\nyet reason tells me, that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex\\neye to one very imperfect and simple, each grade being useful to its\\npossessor, can be shown to exist; if further, the eye does vary ever so\\nslightly, and the variations be inherited, which is certainly the case; and\\nif any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal\\nunder changing conditions of life, then the difficulty of believing that a\\nperfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though\\ninsuperable by our imagination, can hardly be considered real. how a nerve\\ncomes to be sensitive to {187} light, hardly concerns us more than how life\\nitself first originated; but i may remark that several facts make me\\nsuspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light, and\\nlikewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound.\\n\\nin looking for the gradations by which an organ in any species has been\\nperfected, we ought to look exclusively to its lineal ancestors; but this\\nis scarcely ever possible, and we are forced in each case to look to\\nspecies of the same group, that is to the collateral descendants from the\\nsame original parent-form, in order to see what gradations are possible,\\nand for the chance of some gradations having been transmitted from the\\nearlier stages of descent, in an unaltered or little altered condition.\\namongst existing vertebrata, we find but a small amount of gradation in the\\nstructure of the eye, and from fossil species we can learn nothing on this\\nhead. in this great class we should probably have to descend far beneath\\nthe lowest known fossiliferous stratum to discover the earlier stages, by\\nwhich the eye has been perfected.\\n\\nin the articulata we can commence a series with an optic nerve merely\\ncoated with pigment, and without any other mechanism; and from this low\\nstage, numerous gradations of structure, branching off in two fundamentally\\ndifferent lines, can be shown to exist, until we reach a moderately high\\nstage of perfection. in certain crustaceans, for instance, there is a\\ndouble cornea, the inner one divided into facets, within each of which\\nthere is a lens-shaped swelling. in other crustaceans the transparent cones\\nwhich are coated by pigment, and which properly act only by excluding\\nlateral pencils of light, are convex at their upper ends and must act by\\nconvergence; and at their lower ends there seems to be an imperfect\\nvitreous substance. {188} with these facts, here far too briefly and\\nimperfectly given, which show that there is much graduated diversity in the\\neyes of living crustaceans, and bearing in mind how small the number of\\nliving animals is in proportion to those which have become extinct, i can\\nsee no very great difficulty (not more than in the case of many other\\nstructures) in believing that natural selection has converted the simple\\napparatus of an optic nerve merely coated with pigment and invested by\\ntransparent membrane, into an optical instrument as perfect as is possessed\\nby any member of the great articulate class.\\n\\nhe who will go thus far, if he find on finishing this treatise that large\\nbodies of facts, otherwise inexplicable, can be explained by the theory of\\ndescent, ought not to hesitate to go further, and to admit that a structure\\neven as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formed by natural\\nselection, although in this case he does not know any of the transitional\\ngrades. his reason ought to conquer his imagination; though i have felt the\\ndifficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any degree of hesitation in\\nextending the principle of natural selection to such startling lengths.\\n\\nit is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope. we know\\nthat this instrument has been perfected by the long-continued efforts of\\nthe highest human intellects; and we naturally infer that the eye has been\\nformed by a somewhat analogous process. but may not this inference be\\npresumptuous? have we any right to assume that the creator works by\\nintellectual powers like those of man? if we must compare the eye to an\\noptical instrument, we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of\\ntransparent tissue, with a nerve sensitive to light beneath, and then\\nsuppose every part of this layer to be continually changing {189} slowly in\\ndensity, so as to separate into layers of different densities and\\nthicknesses, placed at different distances from each other, and with the\\nsurfaces of each layer slowly changing in form. further we must suppose\\nthat there is a power always intently watching each slight accidental\\nalteration in the transparent layers; and carefully selecting each\\nalteration which, under varied circumstances, may in any way, or in any\\ndegree, tend to produce a distincter image. we must suppose each new state\\nof the instrument to be multiplied by the million; and each to be preserved\\ntill a better be produced, and then the old ones to be destroyed. in living\\nbodies, variation will cause the slight alterations, generation will\\nmultiply them almost infinitely, and natural selection will pick out with\\nunerring skill each improvement. let this process go on for millions on\\nmillions of years; and during each year on millions of individuals of many\\nkinds; and may we not believe that a living optical instrument might thus\\nbe formed as superior to one of glass, as the works of the creator are to\\nthose of man?\\n\\nif it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not\\npossibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my\\ntheory would absolutely break down. but i can find out no such case. no\\ndoubt many organs exist of which we do not know the transitional grades,\\nmore especially if we look to much-isolated species, round which, according\\nto my theory, there has been much extinction. or again, if we look to an\\norgan common to all the members of a large class, for in this latter case\\nthe organ must have been first formed at an extremely remote period, since\\nwhich all the many members of the class have been developed; and in order\\nto discover the early transitional grades through which the organ has {190}\\npassed, we should have to look to very ancient ancestral forms, long since\\nbecome extinct.\\n\\nwe should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not have\\nbeen formed by transitional gradations of some kind. numerous cases could\\nbe given amongst the lower animals of the same organ performing at the same\\ntime wholly distinct functions; thus the alimentary canal respires,\\ndigests, and excretes in the larva of the dragon-fly and in the fish\\ncobites. in the hydra, the animal may be turned inside out, and the\\nexterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire. in such cases\\nnatural selection might easily specialise, if any advantage were thus\\ngained, a part or organ, which had performed two functions, for one\\nfunction alone, and thus wholly change its nature by insensible steps. two\\ndistinct organs sometimes perform simultaneously the same function in the\\nsame individual; to give one instance, there are fish with gills or\\nbranchiг¦ that breathe the air dissolved in the water, at the same time that\\nthey breathe free air in their swimbladders, this latter organ having a\\nductus pneumaticus for its supply, and being divided by highly vascular\\npartitions. in these cases one of the two organs might with ease be\\nmodified and perfected so as to perform all the work by itself, being aided\\nduring the process of modification by the other organ; and then this other\\norgan might be modified for some other and quite distinct purpose, or be\\nquite obliterated.\\n\\nthe illustration of the swimbladder in fishes is a good one, because it\\nshows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally\\nconstructed for one purpose, namely flotation, may be converted into one\\nfor a wholly different purpose, namely respiration. the swimbladder has,\\nalso, been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain\\nfish, or, for i do not know {191} which view is now generally held, a part\\nof the auditory apparatus has been worked in as a complement to the\\nswimbladder. all physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous, or\\n\"ideally similar\" in position and structure with the lungs of the higher\\nvertebrate animals: hence there seems to me to be no great difficulty in\\nbelieving that natural selection has actually converted a swimbladder into\\na lung, or organ used exclusively for respiration.\\n\\ni can, indeed, hardly doubt that all vertebrate animals having true lungs\\nhave descended by ordinary generation from an ancient prototype, of which\\nwe know nothing, furnished with a floating apparatus or swimbladder. we can\\nthus, as i infer from professor owen\\'s interesting description of these\\nparts, understand the strange fact that every particle of food and drink\\nwhich we swallow has to pass over the orifice of the trachea, with some\\nrisk of falling into the lungs, notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance\\nby which the glottis is closed. in the higher vertebrata the branchiг¦ have\\nwholly disappeared--the slits on the sides of the neck and the loop-like\\ncourse of the arteries still marking in the embryo their former position.\\nbut it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiг¦ might have been\\ngradually worked in by natural selection for some quite distinct purpose:\\nin the same manner as, on the view entertained by some naturalists that the\\nbranchiг¦ and dorsal scales of annelids are homologous with the wings and\\nwing-covers of insects, it is probable that organs which at a very ancient\\nperiod served for respiration have been actually converted into organs of\\nflight.\\n\\nin considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear in mind\\nthe probability of conversion from one function to another, that i will\\ngive one more instance. pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of\\nskin, {192} called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve, through the\\nmeans of a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they are hatched\\nwithin the sack. these cirripedes have no branchiг¦, the whole surface of\\nthe body and sack, including the small frena, serving for respiration. the\\nbalanidг¦ or sessile cirripedes, on the other hand, have no ovigerous frena,\\nthe eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack, in the well-enclosed shell;\\nbut they have large folded branchiг¦. now i think no one will dispute that\\nthe ovigerous frena in the one family are strictly homologous with the\\nbranchiг¦ of the other family; indeed, they graduate into each other.\\ntherefore i do not doubt that little folds of skin, which originally served\\nas ovigerous frena, but which, likewise, very slightly aided the act of\\nrespiration, have been gradually converted by natural selection into\\nbranchiг¦, simply through an increase in their size and the obliteration of\\ntheir adhesive glands. if all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct,\\nand they have already suffered far more extinction than have sessile\\ncirripedes, who would ever have imagined that the branchiг¦ in this latter\\nfamily had originally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being\\nwashed out of the sack?\\n\\nalthough we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ could\\nnot possibly have been produced by successive transitional gradations, yet,\\nundoubtedly, grave cases of difficulty occur, some of which will be\\ndiscussed in my future work.\\n\\none of the gravest is that of neuter insects, which are often very\\ndifferently constructed from either the males or fertile females; but this\\ncase will be treated of in the next chapter. the electric organs of fishes\\noffer another case of special difficulty; it is impossible to conceive by\\nwhat steps these wondrous organs have been produced; but, as owen and\\nothers have remarked, {193} their intimate structure closely resembles that\\nof common muscle; and as it has lately been shown that rays have an organ\\nclosely analogous to the electric apparatus, and yet do not, as matteucci\\nasserts, discharge any electricity, we must own that we are far too\\nignorant to argue that no transition of any kind is possible.\\n\\nthe electric organs offer another and even more serious difficulty; for\\nthey occur in only about a dozen fishes, of which several are widely remote\\nin their affinities. generally when the same organ appears in several\\nmembers of the same class, especially if in members having very different\\nhabits of life, we may attribute its presence to inheritance from a common\\nancestor; and its absence in some of the members to its loss through disuse\\nor natural selection. but if the electric organs had been inherited from\\none ancient progenitor thus provided, we might have expected that all\\nelectric fishes would have been specially related to each other. nor does\\ngeology at all lead to the belief that formerly most fishes had electric\\norgans, which most of their modified descendants have lost. the presence of\\nluminous organs in a few insects, belonging to different families and\\norders, offers a parallel case of difficulty. other cases could be given;\\nfor instance in plants, the very curious contrivance of a mass of\\npollen-grains, borne on a foot-stalk with a sticky gland at the end, is the\\nsame in orchis and asclepias,--genera almost as remote as possible amongst\\nflowering plants. in all these cases of two very distinct species furnished\\nwith apparently the same anomalous organ, it should be observed that,\\nalthough the general appearance and function of the organ may be the same,\\nyet some fundamental difference can generally be detected. i am inclined to\\nbelieve that in nearly the same way as two men have sometimes independently\\nhit on {194} the very same invention, so natural selection, working for the\\ngood of each being and taking advantage of analogous variations, has\\nsometimes modified in very nearly the same manner two parts in two organic\\nbeings, which beings owe but little of their structure in common to\\ninheritance from the same ancestor.\\n\\nalthough in many cases it is most difficult to conjecture by what\\ntransitions organs could have arrived at their present state; yet,\\nconsidering that the proportion of living and known forms to the extinct\\nand unknown is very small, i have been astonished how rarely an organ can\\nbe named, towards which no transitional grade is known to lead. the truth\\nof this remark is indeed shown by that old but somewhat exaggerated canon\\nin natural history of \"natura non facit saltum.\" we meet with this\\nadmission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist; or, as\\nmilne edwards has well expressed it, nature is prodigal in variety, but\\nniggard in innovation. why, on the theory of creation, should this be so?\\nwhy should all the parts and organs of many independent beings, each\\nsupposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature, be\\nso commonly linked together by graduated steps? why should not nature have\\ntaken a leap from structure to structure? on the theory of natural\\nselection, we can clearly understand why she should not; for natural\\nselection can act only by taking advantage of slight successive variations;\\nshe can never take a leap, but must advance by the shortest and slowest\\nsteps.\\n\\n\\n\\n_organs of little apparent importance._--as natural selection acts by life\\nand death,--by the preservation of individuals with any favourable\\nvariation, and by the destruction of those with any unfavourable deviation\\nof structure,--i have sometimes felt much difficulty in {195} understanding\\nthe origin of simple parts, of which the importance does not seem\\nsufficient to cause the preservation of successively varying individuals. i\\nhave sometimes felt as much difficulty, though of a very different kind, on\\nthis head, as in the case of an organ as perfect and complex as the eye.\\n\\nin the first place, we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole economy\\nof any one organic being, to say what slight modifications would be of\\nimportance or not. in a former chapter i have given instances of most\\ntrifling characters, such as the down on fruit and the colour of its flesh,\\nwhich, from determining the attacks of insects or from being correlated\\nwith constitutional differences, might assuredly be acted on by natural\\nselection. the tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially constructed\\nfly-flapper; and it seems at first incredible that this could have been\\nadapted for its present purpose by successive slight modifications, each\\nbetter and better, for so trifling an object as driving away flies; yet we\\nshould pause before being too positive even in this case, for we know that\\nthe distribution and existence of cattle and other animals in south america\\nabsolutely depends on their power of resisting the attacks of insects: so\\nthat individuals which could by any means defend themselves from these\\nsmall enemies, would be able to range into new pastures and thus gain a\\ngreat advantage. it is not that the larger quadrupeds are actually\\ndestroyed (except in some rare cases) by flies, but they are incessantly\\nharassed and their strength reduced, so that they are more subject to\\ndisease, or not so well enabled in a coming dearth to search for food, or\\nto escape from beasts of prey.\\n\\norgans now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of high\\nimportance to an early progenitor, and, after having been slowly perfected\\nat a {196} former period, have been transmitted in nearly the same state,\\nalthough now become of very slight use; and any actually injurious\\ndeviations in their structure will always have been checked by natural\\nselection. seeing how important an organ of locomotion the tail is in most\\naquatic animals, its general presence and use for many purposes in so many\\nland animals, which in their lungs or modified swimbladders betray their\\naquatic origin, may perhaps be thus accounted for. a well-developed tail\\nhaving been formed in an aquatic animal, it might subsequently come to be\\nworked in for all sorts of purposes, as a fly-flapper, an organ of\\nprehension, or as an aid in turning, as with the dog, though the aid must\\nbe slight, for the hare, with hardly any tail, can double quickly enough.\\n\\nin the second place, we may sometimes attribute importance to characters\\nwhich are really of very little importance, and which have originated from\\nquite secondary causes, independently of natural selection. we should\\nremember that climate, food, &c., probably have some little direct\\ninfluence on the organisation; that characters reappear from the law of\\nreversion; that correlation of growth will have had a most important\\ninfluence in modifying various structures; and finally, that sexual\\nselection will often have largely modified the external characters of\\nanimals having a will, to give one male an advantage in fighting with\\nanother or in charming the females. moreover when a modification of\\nstructure has primarily arisen from the above or other unknown causes, it\\nmay at first have been of no advantage to the species, but may subsequently\\nhave been taken advantage of by the descendants of the species under new\\nconditions of life and with newly acquired habits.\\n\\nto give a few instances to illustrate these latter {197} remarks. if green\\nwoodpeckers alone had existed, and we did not know that there were many\\nblack and pied kinds, i dare say that we should have thought that the green\\ncolour was a beautiful adaptation to hide this tree-frequenting bird from\\nits enemies; and consequently that it was a character of importance and\\nmight have been acquired through natural selection; as it is, i have no\\ndoubt that the colour is due to some quite distinct cause, probably to\\nsexual selection. a trailing bamboo in the malay archipelago climbs the\\nloftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around\\nthe ends of the branches, and this contrivance, no doubt, is of the highest\\nservice to the plant; but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees\\nwhich are not climbers, the hooks on the bamboo may have arisen from\\nunknown laws of growth, and have been subsequently taken advantage of by\\nthe plant undergoing further modification and becoming a climber. the naked\\nskin on the head of a vulture is generally looked at as a direct adaptation\\nfor wallowing in putridity; and so it may be, or it may possibly be due to\\nthe direct action of putrid matter; but we should be very cautious in\\ndrawing any such inference, when we see that the skin on the head of the\\nclean-feeding male turkey is likewise naked. the sutures in the skulls of\\nyoung mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding\\nparturition, and no doubt they facilitate, or may be indispensable for this\\nact; but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles, which\\nhave only to escape from a broken egg, we may infer that this structure has\\narisen from the laws of growth, and has been taken advantage of in the\\nparturition of the higher animals.\\n\\nwe are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant\\nvariations; and we are {198} immediately made conscious of this by\\nreflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals in\\ndifferent countries,--more especially in the less civilised countries where\\nthere has been but little artificial selection. careful observers are\\nconvinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair, and that with\\nthe hair the horns are correlated. mountain breeds always differ from\\nlowland breeds; and a mountainous country would probably affect the hind\\nlimbs from exercising them more, and possibly even the form of the pelvis;\\nand then by the law of homologous variation, the front limbs and even the\\nhead would probably be affected. the shape, also, of the pelvis might\\naffect by pressure the shape of the head of the young in the womb. the\\nlaborious breathing necessary in high regions would, we have some reason to\\nbelieve, increase the size of the chest; and again correlation would come\\ninto play. animals kept by savages in different countries often have to\\nstruggle for their own subsistence, and would be exposed to a certain\\nextent to natural selection, and individuals with slightly different\\nconstitutions would succeed best under different climates; and there is\\nreason to believe that constitution and colour are correlated. a good\\nobserver, also, states that in cattle susceptibility to the attacks of\\nflies is correlated with colour, as is the liability to be poisoned by\\ncertain plants; so that colour would be thus subjected to the action of\\nnatural selection. but we are far too ignorant to speculate on the relative\\nimportance of the several known and unknown laws of variation; and i have\\nhere alluded to them only to show that, if we are unable to account for the\\ncharacteristic differences of our domestic breeds, which nevertheless we\\ngenerally admit to have arisen through ordinary generation, we ought not to\\nlay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause {199} of the\\nslight analogous differences between species. i might have adduced for this\\nsame purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so\\nstrongly marked; i may add that some little light can apparently be thrown\\non the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a\\nparticular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning\\nwould appear frivolous.\\n\\nthe foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately made\\nby some naturalists, against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of\\nstructure has been produced for the good of its possessor. they believe\\nthat very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man,\\nor for mere variety. this doctrine, if true, would be absolutely fatal to\\nmy theory. yet i fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to\\ntheir possessors. physical conditions probably have had some little effect\\non structure, quite independently of any good thus gained. correlation of\\ngrowth has no doubt played a most important part, and a useful modification\\nof one part will often have entailed on other parts diversified changes of\\nno direct use. so again characters which formerly were useful, or which\\nformerly had arisen from correlation of growth, or from other unknown\\ncause, may reappear from the law of reversion, though now of no direct use.\\nthe effects of sexual selection, when displayed in beauty to charm the\\nfemales, can be called useful only in rather a forced sense. but by far the\\nmost important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of\\nevery being is simply due to inheritance; and consequently, though each\\nbeing assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature, many structures now\\nhave no direct relation to the habits of life of each species. thus, we can\\nhardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland {200} goose or of the\\nfrigate-bird are of special use to these birds; we cannot believe that the\\nsame bones in the arm of the monkey, in the fore-leg of the horse, in the\\nwing of the bat, and in the nipper of the seal, are of special use to these\\nanimals. we may safely attribute these structures to inheritance. but to\\nthe progenitor of the upland goose and of the frigate-bird, webbed feet no\\ndoubt were as useful as they now are to the most aquatic of existing birds.\\nso we may believe that the progenitor of the seal had not a nipper, but a\\nfoot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping; and we may further\\nventure to believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey,\\nhorse, and bat, which have been inherited from a common progenitor, were\\nformerly of more special use to that progenitor, or its progenitors, than\\nthey now are to these animals having such widely diversified habits.\\ntherefore we may infer that these several bones might have been acquired\\nthrough natural selection, subjected formerly, as now, to the several laws\\nof inheritance, reversion, correlation of growth, &c. hence every detail of\\nstructure in every living creature (making some little allowance for the\\ndirect action of physical conditions) may be viewed, either as having been\\nof special use to some ancestral form, or as being now of special use to\\nthe descendants of this form--either directly, or indirectly through the\\ncomplex laws of growth.\\n\\nnatural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in any one\\nspecies exclusively for the good of another species; though throughout\\nnature one species incessantly takes advantage of, and profits by, the\\nstructure of another. but natural selection can and does often produce\\nstructures for the direct injury of other species, as we see in the fang of\\nthe adder, and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon, by which its eggs are\\n{201} deposited in the living bodies of other insects. if it could be\\nproved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed\\nfor the exclusive good of another species, it would annihilate my theory,\\nfor such could not have been produced through natural selection. although\\nmany statements may be found in works on natural history to this effect, i\\ncannot find even one which seems to me of any weight. it is admitted that\\nthe rattlesnake has a poison-fang for its own defence and for the\\ndestruction of its prey; but some authors suppose that at the same time\\nthis snake is furnished with a rattle for its own injury, namely, to warn\\nits prey to escape. i would almost as soon believe that the cat curls the\\nend of its tail when preparing to spring, in order to warn the doomed\\nmouse. but i have not space here to enter on this and other such cases.\\n\\nnatural selection will never produce in a being anything injurious to\\nitself, for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of each. no\\norgan will be formed, as paley has remarked, for the purpose of causing\\npain or for doing an injury to its possessor. if a fair balance be struck\\nbetween the good and evil caused by each part, each will be found on the\\nwhole advantageous. after the lapse of time, under changing conditions of\\nlife, if any part comes to be injurious, it will be modified; or if it be\\nnot so, the being will become extinct, as myriads have become extinct.\\n\\nnatural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as, or\\nslightly more perfect than, the other inhabitants of the same country with\\nwhich it has to struggle for existence. and we see that this is the degree\\nof perfection attained under nature. the endemic productions of new\\nzealand, for instance, are perfect one compared with another; but they are\\nnow rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants {202} and\\nanimals introduced from europe. natural selection will not produce absolute\\nperfection, nor do we always meet, as far as we can judge, with this high\\nstandard under nature. the correction for the aberration of light is said,\\non high authority, not to be perfect even in that most perfect organ, the\\neye. if our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of\\ninimitable contrivances in nature, this same reason tells us, though we may\\neasily err on both sides, that some other contrivances are less perfect.\\ncan we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee as perfect, which, when\\nused against many attacking animals, cannot be withdrawn, owing to the\\nbackward serratures, and so inevitably causes the death of the insect by\\ntearing out its viscera?\\n\\nif we look at the sting of the bee, as having originally existed in a\\nremote progenitor as a boring and serrated instrument, like that in so many\\nmembers of the same great order, and which has been modified but not\\nperfected for its present purpose, with the poison originally adapted to\\ncause galls subsequently intensified, we can perhaps understand how it is\\nthat the use of the sting should so often cause the insect\\'s own death: for\\nif on the whole the power of stinging be useful to the community, it will\\nfulfil all the requirements of natural selection, though it may cause the\\ndeath of some few members. if we admire the truly wonderful power of scent\\nby which the males of many insects find their females, can we admire the\\nproduction for this single purpose of thousands of drones, which are\\nutterly useless to the community for any other end, and which are\\nultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters? it may be\\ndifficult, but we ought to admire the savage instinctive hatred of the\\nqueen-bee, which urges her instantly to destroy the {203} young queens her\\ndaughters as soon as born, or to perish herself in the combat; for\\nundoubtedly this is for the good of the community; and maternal love or\\nmaternal hatred, though the latter fortunately is most rare, is all the\\nsame to the inexorable principle of natural selection. if we admire the\\nseveral ingenious contrivances, by which the flowers of the orchis and of\\nmany other plants are fertilised through insect agency, can we consider as\\nequally perfect the elaboration by our fir-trees of dense clouds of pollen,\\nin order that a few granules may be wafted by a chance breeze on to the\\novules?\\n\\n\\n\\n_summary of chapter._--we have in this chapter discussed some of the\\ndifficulties and objections which may be urged against my theory. many of\\nthem are very serious; but i think that in the discussion light has been\\nthrown on several facts, which on the theory of independent acts of\\ncreation are utterly obscure. we have seen that species at any one period\\nare not indefinitely variable, and are not linked together by a multitude\\nof intermediate gradations, partly because the process of natural selection\\nwill always be very slow, and will act, at any one time, only on a very few\\nforms; and partly because the very process of natural selection almost\\nimplies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and\\nintermediate gradations. closely allied species, now living on a continuous\\narea, must often have been formed when the area was not continuous, and\\nwhen the conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part\\nto another. when two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous\\narea, an intermediate variety will often be formed, fitted for an\\nintermediate zone; but from reasons assigned, the intermediate variety will\\nusually exist in lesser numbers than {204} the two forms which it connects;\\nconsequently the two latter, during the course of further modification,\\nfrom existing in greater numbers, will have a great advantage over the less\\nnumerous intermediate variety, and will thus generally succeed in\\nsupplanting and exterminating it.\\n\\nwe have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding that\\nthe most different habits of life could not graduate into each other; that\\na bat, for instance, could not have been formed by natural selection from\\nan animal which at first could only glide through the air.\\n\\nwe have seen that a species may under new conditions of life change its\\nhabits, or have diversified habits, with some habits very unlike those of\\nits nearest congeners. hence we can understand, bearing in mind that each\\norganic being is trying to live wherever it can live, how it has arisen\\nthat there are upland geese with webbed feet, ground woodpeckers, diving\\nthrushes, and petrels with the habits of auks.\\n\\nalthough the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been\\nformed by natural selection, is more than enough to stagger any one; yet in\\nthe case of any organ, if we know of a long series of gradations in\\ncomplexity, each good for its possessor, then, under changing conditions of\\nlife there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any\\nconceivable degree of perfection through natural selection. in the cases in\\nwhich we know of no intermediate or transitional states, we should be very\\ncautious in concluding that none could have existed, for the homologies of\\nmany organs and their intermediate states show that wonderful metamorphoses\\nin function are at least possible. for instance, a swim-bladder has\\napparently been converted into an air-breathing lung. the same organ having\\nperformed {205} simultaneously very different functions, and then having\\nbeen specialised for one function; and two very distinct organs having\\nperformed at the same time the same function, the one having been perfected\\nwhilst aided by the other, must often have largely facilitated transitions.\\n\\nwe are far too ignorant, in almost every case, to be enabled to assert that\\nany part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species, that\\nmodifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated by\\nmeans of natural selection. but we may confidently believe that many\\nmodifications, wholly due to the laws of growth, and at first in no way\\nadvantageous to a species, have been subsequently taken advantage of by the\\nstill further modified descendants of this species. we may, also, believe\\nthat a part formerly of high importance has often been retained (as the\\ntail of an aquatic animal by its terrestrial descendants), though it has\\nbecome of such small importance that it could not, in its present state,\\nhave been acquired by natural selection,--a power which acts solely by the\\npreservation of profitable variations in the struggle for life.\\n\\nnatural selection will produce nothing in one species for the exclusive\\ngood or injury of another; though it may well produce parts, organs, and\\nexcretions highly useful or even indispensable, or highly injurious to\\nanother species, but in all cases at the same time useful to the owner.\\nnatural selection in each well-stocked country, must act chiefly through\\nthe competition of the inhabitants one with another, and consequently will\\nproduce perfection, or strength in the battle for life, only according to\\nthe standard of that country. hence the inhabitants of one country,\\ngenerally the smaller one, will often yield, as we see they do yield, to\\nthe inhabitants of another and generally larger country. for in {206} the\\nlarger country there will have existed more individuals, and more\\ndiversified forms, and the competition will have been severer, and thus the\\nstandard of perfection will have been rendered higher. natural selection\\nwill not necessarily produce absolute perfection; nor, as far as we can\\njudge by our limited faculties, can absolute perfection be everywhere\\nfound.\\n\\non the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full\\nmeaning of that old canon in natural history, \"natura non facit saltum.\"\\nthis canon, if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world, is not\\nstrictly correct, but if we include all those of past times, it must by my\\ntheory be strictly true.\\n\\nit is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on\\ntwo great laws--unity of type, and the conditions of existence. by unity of\\ntype is meant that fundamental agreement in structure, which we see in\\norganic beings of the same class, and which is quite independent of their\\nhabits of life. on my theory, unity of type is explained by unity of\\ndescent. the expression of conditions of existence, so often insisted on by\\nthe illustrious cuvier, is fully embraced by the principle of natural\\nselection. for natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying\\nparts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life; or by\\nhaving adapted them during long-past periods of time: the adaptations being\\naided in some cases by use and disuse, being slightly affected by the\\ndirect action of the external conditions of life, and being in all cases\\nsubjected to the several laws of growth. hence, in fact, the law of the\\nconditions of existence is the higher law; as it includes, through the\\ninheritance of former adaptations, that of unity of type.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *

of the natural\\n    selection of instincts--neuter or sterile insects--summary.\\n\\nthe subject of instinct might have been worked into the previous chapters;\\nbut i have thought that it would be more convenient to treat the subject\\nseparately, especially as so wonderful an instinct as that of the hive-bee\\nmaking its cells will probably have occurred to many readers, as a\\ndifficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole theory. i must premise, that i\\nhave nothing to do with the origin of the primary mental powers, any more\\nthan i have with that of life itself. we are concerned only with the\\ndiversities of instinct and of the other mental qualities of animals within\\nthe same class.\\n\\ni will not attempt any definition of instinct. it would be easy to show\\nthat several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term;\\nbut every one understands what is meant, when it is said that instinct\\nimpels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds\\' nests. an\\naction, which we ourselves should require experience to enable us to\\nperform, when performed by an animal, more especially by a very young one,\\nwithout any experience, and when performed by many individuals in the same\\nway, without their knowing for what purpose it is performed, is usually\\nsaid to be instinctive. {208} but i could show that none of these\\ncharacters of instinct are universal. a little dose, as pierre huber\\nexpresses it, of judgment or reason, often comes into play, even in animals\\nvery low in the scale of nature.\\n\\nfrederick cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared\\ninstinct with habit. this comparison gives, i think, a remarkably accurate\\nnotion of the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed,\\nbut not of its origin. how unconsciously many habitual actions are\\nperformed, indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious will!\\nyet they may be modified by the will or reason. habits easily become\\nassociated with other habits, and with certain periods of time and states\\nof the body. when once acquired, they often remain constant throughout\\nlife. several other points of resemblance between instincts and habits\\ncould be pointed out. as in repeating a well-known song, so in instincts,\\none action follows another by a sort of rhythm; if a person be interrupted\\nin a song, or in repeating anything by rote, he is generally forced to go\\nback to recover the habitual train of thought: so p. huber found it was\\nwith a caterpillar, which makes a very complicated hammock; for if he took\\na caterpillar which had completed its hammock up to, say, the sixth stage\\nof construction, and put it into a hammock completed up only to the third\\nstage, the caterpillar simply re-performed the fourth, fifth, and sixth\\nstages of construction. if, however, a caterpillar were taken out of a\\nhammock made up, for instance, to the third stage, and were put into one\\nfinished up to the sixth stage, so that much of its work, was already done\\nfor it, far from feeling the benefit of this, it was much embarrassed, and,\\nin order to complete its hammock, seemed forced to start from the third\\nstage, where it had left off, and thus tried to complete the already\\nfinished work. {209}\\n\\nif we suppose any habitual action to become inherited--and i think it can\\nbe shown that this does sometimes happen--then the resemblance between what\\noriginally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be\\ndistinguished. if mozart, instead of playing the pianoforte at three years\\nold with wonderfully little practice, had played a tune with no practice at\\nall, he might truly be said to have done so instinctively. but it would be\\nthe most serious error to suppose that the greater number of instincts have\\nbeen acquired by habit in one generation, and then transmitted by\\ninheritance to succeeding generations. it can be clearly shown that the\\nmost wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted, namely, those of the\\nhive-bee and of many ants, could not possibly have been thus acquired.\\n\\nit will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as\\ncorporeal structure for the welfare of each species, under its present\\nconditions of life. under changed conditions of life, it is at least\\npossible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a\\nspecies; and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little, then\\ni can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually\\naccumulating variations of instinct to any extent that may be profitable.\\nit is thus, as i believe, that all the most complex and wonderful instincts\\nhave originated. as modifications of corporeal structure arise from, and\\nare increased by, use or habit, and are diminished or lost by disuse, so i\\ndo not doubt it has been with instincts. but i believe that the effects of\\nhabit are of quite subordinate importance to the effects of the natural\\nselection of what may be called accidental variations of instincts;--that\\nis of variations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight\\ndeviations of bodily structure.\\n\\nno complex instinct can possibly be produced through {210} natural\\nselection, except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous, slight,\\nyet profitable, variations. hence, as in the case of corporeal structures,\\nwe ought to find in nature, not the actual transitional gradations by which\\neach complex instinct has been acquired--for these could be found only in\\nthe lineal ancestors of each species--but we ought to find in the\\ncollateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations; or we ought\\nat least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are possible; and\\nthis we certainly can do. i have been surprised to find, making allowance\\nfor the instincts of animals having been but little observed except in\\neurope and north america, and for no instinct being known amongst extinct\\nspecies, how very generally gradations, leading to the most complex\\ninstincts, can be discovered. changes of instinct may sometimes be\\nfacilitated by the same species having different instincts at different\\nperiods of life, or at different seasons of the year, or when placed under\\ndifferent circumstances &c.; in which case either one or the other instinct\\nmight be preserved by natural selection. and such instances of diversity of\\ninstinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature.\\n\\nagain as in the case of corporeal structure, and conformably with my\\ntheory, the instinct of each species is good for itself, but has never, as\\nfar as we can judge, been produced for the exclusive good of others. one of\\nthe strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an action for\\nthe sole good of another, with which i am acquainted, is that of aphides\\nvoluntarily yielding their sweet excretion to ants: that they do so\\nvoluntarily, the following facts show. i removed all the ants from a group\\nof about a dozen aphides on a dock-plant, and prevented their attendance\\nduring several hours. after this interval, i felt sure that the aphides\\n{211} would want to excrete. i watched them for some time through a lens,\\nbut not one excreted; i then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the\\nsame manner, as well as i could, as the ants do with their antennг¦; but not\\none excreted. afterwards i allowed an ant to visit them, and it immediately\\nseemed, by its eager way of running about, to be well aware what a rich\\nflock it had discovered; it then began to play with its antennг¦ on the\\nabdomen first of one aphis and then of another; and each aphis, as soon as\\nit felt the antennг¦, immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a\\nlimpid drop of sweet juice, which was eagerly devoured by the ant. even the\\nquite young aphides behaved in this manner, showing that the action was\\ninstinctive, and not the result of experience. but as the excretion is\\nextremely viscid, it is probably a convenience to the aphides to have it\\nremoved; and therefore probably the aphides do not instinctively excrete\\nfor the sole good of the ants. although i do not believe that any animal in\\nthe world performs an action for the exclusive good of another of a\\ndistinct species, yet each species tries to take advantage of the instincts\\nof others, as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of\\nothers. so again, in some few cases, certain instincts cannot be considered\\nas absolutely perfect; but as details on this and other such points are not\\nindispensable, they may be here passed over.\\n\\nas some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature, and the\\ninheritance of such variations, are indispensable for the action of natural\\nselection, as many instances as possible ought to be here given; but want\\nof space prevents me. i can only assert, that instincts certainly do\\nvary--for instance, the migratory instinct, both in extent and direction,\\nand in its total loss. so it is with the nests of birds, which vary partly\\n{212} in dependence on the situations chosen, and on the nature and\\ntemperature of the country inhabited, but often from causes wholly unknown\\nto us: audubon has given several remarkable cases of differences in the\\nnests of the same species in the northern and southern united states. fear\\nof any particular enemy is certainly an instinctive quality, as may be seen\\nin nestling birds, though it is strengthened by experience, and by the\\nsight of fear of the same enemy in other animals. but fear of man is slowly\\nacquired, as i have elsewhere shown, by various animals inhabiting desert\\nislands; and we may see an instance of this, even in england, in the\\ngreater wildness of all our large birds than of our small birds; for the\\nlarge birds have been most persecuted by man. we may safely attribute the\\ngreater wildness of our large birds to this cause; for in uninhabited\\nislands large birds are not more fearful than small; and the magpie, so\\nwary in england, is tame in norway, as is the hooded crow in egypt.\\n\\nthat the general disposition of individuals of the same species, born in a\\nstate of nature, is extremely diversified, can be shown by a multitude of\\nfacts. several cases also, could be given, of occasional and strange habits\\nin certain species, which might, if advantageous to the species, give rise,\\nthrough natural selection, to quite new instincts. but i am well aware that\\nthese general statements, without facts given in detail, can produce but a\\nfeeble effect on the reader\\'s mind. i can only repeat my assurance, that i\\ndo not speak without good evidence.\\n\\nthe possibility, or even probability, of inherited variations of instinct\\nin a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly considering a few\\ncases under domestication. we shall thus also be enabled to see the\\nrespective parts which habit and the selection of {213} so-called\\naccidental variations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our\\ndomestic animals. a number of curious and authentic instances could be\\ngiven of the inheritance of all shades of disposition and tastes, and\\nlikewise of the oddest tricks, associated with certain frames of mind or\\nperiods of time. but let us look to the familiar case of the several breeds\\nof dogs: it cannot be doubted that young pointers (i have myself seen a\\nstriking instance) will sometimes point and even back other dogs the very\\nfirst time that they are taken out; retrieving is certainly in some degree\\ninherited by retrievers; and a tendency to run round, instead of at, a\\nflock of sheep, by shepherd-dogs. i cannot see that these actions,\\nperformed without experience by the young, and in nearly the same manner by\\neach individual, performed with eager delight by each breed, and without\\nthe end being known,--for the young pointer can no more know that he points\\nto aid his master, than the white butterfly knows why she lays her eggs on\\nthe leaf of the cabbage,--i cannot see that these actions differ\\nessentially from true instincts. if we were to see one kind of wolf, when\\nyoung and without any training, as soon as it scented its prey, stand\\nmotionless like a statue, and then slowly crawl forward with a peculiar\\ngait; and another kind of wolf rushing round, instead of at, a herd of\\ndeer, and driving them to a distant point, we should assuredly call these\\nactions instinctive. domestic instincts, as they may be called, are\\ncertainly far less fixed or invariable than natural instincts; but they\\nhave been acted on by far less rigorous selection, and have been\\ntransmitted for an incomparably shorter period, under less fixed conditions\\nof life.\\n\\nhow strongly these domestic instincts, habits, and dispositions are\\ninherited, and how curiously they become mingled, is well shown when\\ndifferent breeds of dogs are {214} crossed. thus it is known that a cross\\nwith a bull-dog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy\\nof greyhounds; and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family of\\nshepherd-dogs a tendency to hunt hares. these domestic instincts, when thus\\ntested by crossing, resemble natural instincts, which in a like manner\\nbecome curiously blended together, and for a long period exhibit traces of\\nthe instincts of either parent: for example, le roy describes a dog, whose\\ngreat-grandfather was a wolf, and this dog showed a trace of its wild\\nparentage only in one way, by not coming in a straight line to his master\\nwhen called.\\n\\ndomestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become\\ninherited solely from long-continued and compulsory habit, but this, i\\nthink, is not true. no one would ever have thought of teaching, or probably\\ncould have taught, the tumbler-pigeon to tumble,--an action which, as i\\nhave witnessed, is performed by young birds, that have never seen a pigeon\\ntumble. we may believe that some one pigeon showed a slight tendency to\\nthis strange habit, and that the long-continued selection of the best\\nindividuals in successive generations made tumblers what they now are; and\\nnear glasgow there are house-tumblers, as i hear from mr. brent, which\\ncannot fly eighteen inches high without going head over heels. it may be\\ndoubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to point, had\\nnot some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line; and this is known\\noccasionally to happen, as i once saw in a pure terrier: the act of\\npointing is probably, as many have thought, only the exaggerated pause of\\nan animal preparing to spring on its prey. when the first tendency to point\\nwas once displayed, methodical selection and the inherited effects of\\ncompulsory training in each successive generation would soon complete the\\n{215} work; and unconscious selection is still at work, as each man tries\\nto procure, without intending to improve the breed, dogs which will stand\\nand hunt best. on the other hand, habit alone in some cases has sufficed;\\nno animal is more difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit;\\nscarcely any animal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit; but i do\\nnot suppose that domestic rabbits have ever been selected for tameness; and\\ni presume that we must attribute the whole of the inherited change from\\nextreme wildness to extreme tameness, simply to habit and long-continued\\nclose confinement.\\n\\nnatural instincts are lost under domestication: a remarkable instance of\\nthis is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become\\n\"broody,\" that is, never wish to sit on their eggs. familiarity alone\\nprevents our seeing how universally and largely the minds of our domestic\\nanimals have been modified by domestication. it is scarcely possible to\\ndoubt that the love of man has become instinctive in the dog. all wolves,\\nfoxes, jackals, and species of the cat genus, when kept tame, are most\\neager to attack poultry, sheep, and pigs; and this tendency has been found\\nincurable in dogs which have been brought home as puppies from countries,\\nsuch as tierra del fuego and australia, where the savages do not keep these\\ndomestic animals. how rarely, on the other hand, do our civilised dogs,\\neven when quite young, require to be taught not to attack poultry, sheep,\\nand pigs! no doubt they occasionally do make an attack, and are then\\nbeaten; and if not cured, they are destroyed; so that habit, with some\\ndegree of selection, has probably concurred in civilising by inheritance\\nour dogs. on the other hand, young chickens have lost, wholly by habit,\\nthat fear of the dog and cat which no doubt was originally instinctive in\\nthem, in the same way as it is so plainly instinctive in {216} young\\npheasants, though reared under a hen. it is not that chickens have lost all\\nfear, but fear only of dogs and cats, for if the hen gives the\\ndanger-chuckle, they will run (more especially young turkeys) from under\\nher, and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass or thickets; and this\\nis evidently done for the instinctive purpose of allowing, as we see in\\nwild ground-birds, their mother to fly away. but this instinct retained by\\nour chickens has become useless under domestication, for the mother-hen has\\nalmost lost by disuse the power of flight.\\n\\nhence, we may conclude, that domestic instincts have been acquired and\\nnatural instincts have been lost partly by habit, and partly by man\\nselecting and accumulating during successive generations, peculiar mental\\nhabits and actions, which at first appeared from what we must in our\\nignorance call an accident. in some cases compulsory habit alone has\\nsufficed to produce such inherited mental changes; in other cases\\ncompulsory habit has done nothing, and all has been the result of\\nselection, pursued both methodically and unconsciously; but in most cases,\\nprobably, habit and selection have acted together.\\n\\nwe shall, perhaps, best understand how instincts in a state of nature have\\nbecome modified by selection, by considering a few cases. i will select\\nonly three, out of the several which i shall have to discuss in my future\\nwork,--namely, the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay her eggs in other\\nbirds\\' nests; the slave-making instinct of certain ants; and the\\ncomb-making power of the hive-bee; these two latter instincts have\\ngenerally, and most justly, been ranked by naturalists as the most\\nwonderful of all known instincts.\\n\\nit is now commonly admitted that the more immediate and final cause of the\\ncuckoo\\'s instinct is, that {217} she lays her eggs, not daily, but at\\nintervals of two or three days; so that, if she were to make her own nest\\nand sit on her own eggs, those first laid would have to be left for some\\ntime unincubated, or there would be eggs and young birds of different ages\\nin the same nest. if this were the case, the process of laying and hatching\\nmight be inconveniently long, more especially as she has to migrate at a\\nvery early period; and the first hatched young would probably have to be\\nfed by the male alone. but the american cuckoo is in this predicament; for\\nshe makes her own nest and has eggs and young successively hatched, all at\\nthe same time. it has been asserted that the american cuckoo occasionally\\nlays her eggs in other birds\\' nests; but i hear on the high authority of\\ndr. brewer, that this is a mistake. nevertheless, i could give several\\ninstances of various birds which have been known occasionally to lay their\\neggs in other birds\\' nests. now let us suppose that the ancient progenitor\\nof our european cuckoo had the habits of the american cuckoo; but that\\noccasionally she laid an egg in another bird\\'s nest. if the old bird\\nprofited by this occasional habit, or if the young were made more vigorous\\nby advantage having been taken of the mistaken maternal instinct of another\\nbird, than by their own mother\\'s care, encumbered as she can hardly fail to\\nbe by having eggs and young of different ages at the same time; then the\\nold birds or the fostered young would gain an advantage. and analogy would\\nlead me to believe, that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by\\ninheritance the occasional and aberrant habit of their mother, and in their\\nturn would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds\\' nests, and thus be\\nsuccessful in rearing their young. by a continued process of this nature, i\\nbelieve that the strange instinct of our cuckoo could be, and has been,\\n{218} generated. i may add that, according to dr. gray and to some other\\nobservers, the european cuckoo has not utterly lost all maternal love and\\ncare for her own offspring.\\n\\nthe occasional habit of birds laying their eggs in other birds\\' nests,\\neither of the same or of a distinct species, is not very uncommon with the\\ngallinaceг¦; and this perhaps explains the origin of a singular instinct in\\nthe allied group of ostriches. for several hen ostriches, at least in the\\ncase of the american species, unite and lay first a few eggs in one nest\\nand then in another; and these are hatched by the males. this instinct may\\nprobably be accounted for by the fact of the hens laying a large number of\\neggs; but, as in the case of the cuckoo, at intervals of two or three days.\\nthis instinct, however, of the american ostrich has not as yet been\\nperfected; for a surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the plains, so\\nthat in one day\\'s hunting i picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted\\neggs.\\n\\nmany bees are parasitic, and always lay their eggs in the nests of bees of\\nother kinds. this case is more remarkable than that of the cuckoo; for\\nthese bees have not only their instincts but their structure modified in\\naccordance with their parasitic habits; for they do not possess the\\npollen-collecting apparatus which would be necessary if they had to store\\nfood for their own young. some species, likewise, of sphegidг¦ (wasp-like\\ninsects) are parasitic on other species; and m. fabre has lately shown good\\nreason for believing that although the tachytes nigra generally makes its\\nown burrow and stores it with paralysed prey for its own larvг¦ to feed on,\\nyet that when this insect finds a burrow already made and stored by another\\nsphex, it takes advantage of the prize, and becomes for the occasion\\nparasitic. in this case, as with the supposed case of the cuckoo, i can\\n{219} see no difficulty in natural selection making an occasional habit\\npermanent, if of advantage to the species, and if the insect whose nest and\\nstored food are thus feloniously appropriated, be not thus exterminated.\\n\\n\\n\\n_slave-making instinct._--this remarkable instinct was first discovered in\\nthe formica (polyerges) rufescens by pierre huber, a better observer even\\nthan his celebrated father. this ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves;\\nwithout their aid, the species would certainly become extinct in a single\\nyear. the males and fertile females do no work. the workers or sterile\\nfemales, though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves, do no\\nother work. they are incapable of making their own nests, or of feeding\\ntheir own larvг¦. when the old nest is found inconvenient, and they have to\\nmigrate, it is the slaves which determine the migration, and actually carry\\ntheir masters in their jaws. so utterly helpless are the masters, that when\\nhuber shut up thirty of them without a slave, but with plenty of the food\\nwhich they like best, and with their larvae and pupг¦ to stimulate them to\\nwork, they did nothing; they could not even feed themselves, and many\\nperished of hunger. huber then introduced a single slave (f. fusca), and\\nshe instantly set to work, fed and saved the survivors; made some cells and\\ntended the larvг¦, and put all to rights. what can be more extraordinary\\nthan these well-ascertained facts? if we had not known of any other\\nslave-making ant, it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so\\nwonderful an instinct could have been perfected.\\n\\nanother species, formica sanguinea, was likewise first discovered by p.\\nhuber to be a slave-making ant. this species is found in the southern parts\\nof england, and its habits have been attended to by mr. f. smith, of {220}\\nthe british museum, to whom i am much indebted for information on this and\\nother subjects. although fully trusting to the statements of huber and mr.\\nsmith, i tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame of mind, as any\\none may well be excused for doubting the truth of so extraordinary and\\nodious an instinct as that of making slaves. hence i will give the\\nobservations which i have myself made, in some little detail. i opened\\nfourteen nests of f. sanguinea, and found a few slaves in all. males and\\nfertile females of the slave-species (f. fusca) are found only in their own\\nproper communities, and have never been observed in the nests of f.\\nsanguinea. the slaves are black and not above half the size of their red\\nmasters, so that the contrast in their appearance is very great. when the\\nnest is slightly disturbed, the slaves occasionally come out, and like\\ntheir masters are much agitated and defend the nest: when the nest is much\\ndisturbed and the larvг¦ and pupг¦ are exposed, the slaves work energetically\\nwith their masters in carrying them away to a place of safety. hence, it is\\nclear, that the slaves feel quite at home. during the months of june and\\njuly, on three successive years, i have watched for many hours several\\nnests in surrey and sussex, and never saw a slave either leave or enter a\\nnest. as, during these months, the slaves are very few in number, i thought\\nthat they might behave differently when more numerous; but mr. smith\\ninforms me that he has watched the nests at various hours during may, june\\nand august, both in surrey and hampshire, and has never seen the slaves,\\nthrough present in large numbers in august, either leave or enter the nest.\\nhence he considers them as strictly household slaves. the masters, on the\\nother hand, may be constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest, and\\nfood of all kinds. during the present year, however, in the month {221} of\\njuly, i came across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves,\\nand i observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest,\\nand marching along the same road to a tall scotch-fir-tree, twenty-five\\nyards distant, which they ascended together, probably in search of aphides\\nor cocci. according to huber, who had ample opportunities for observation,\\nin switzerland the slaves habitually work with their masters in making the\\nnest, and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening;\\nand, as huber expressly states, their principal office is to search for\\naphides. this difference in the usual habits of the masters and slaves in\\nthe two countries, probably depends merely on the slaves being captured in\\ngreater numbers in switzerland than in england.\\n\\none day i fortunately witnessed a migration of f. sanguinea from one nest\\nto another, and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the masters\\ncarefully carrying (instead of being carried by, as in the case of f.\\nrufescens) their slaves in their jaws. another day my attention was struck\\nby about a score of the slave-makers haunting the same spot, and evidently\\nnot in search of food; they approached and were vigorously repulsed by an\\nindependent community of the slave-species (f. fusca); sometimes as many as\\nthree of these ants clinging to the legs of the slave-making f. sanguinea.\\nthe latter ruthlessly killed their small opponents, and carried their dead\\nbodies as food to their nest, twenty-nine yards distant; but they were\\nprevented from getting any pupг¦ to rear as slaves. i then dug up a small\\nparcel of the pupг¦ of f. fusca from another nest, and put them down on a\\nbare spot near the place of combat; they were eagerly seized, and carried\\noff by the tyrants, who perhaps fancied that, after all, they had been\\nvictorious in their late combat. {222}\\n\\nat the same time i laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupг¦ of\\nanother species, f. flava, with a few of these little yellow ants still\\nclinging to the fragments of the nest. this species is sometimes, though\\nrarely, made into slaves, as has been described by mr. smith. although so\\nsmall a species, it is very courageous, and i have seen it ferociously\\nattack other ants. in one instance i found to my surprise an independent\\ncommunity of f. flava under a stone beneath a nest of the slave-making f.\\nsanguinea; and when i had accidentally disturbed both nests, the little\\nants attacked their big neighbours with surprising courage. now i was\\ncurious to ascertain whether f. sanguinea could distinguish the pupг¦ of f.\\nfusca, which they habitually make into slaves, from those of the little and\\nfurious f. flava, which they rarely capture, and it was evident that they\\ndid at once distinguish them: for we have seen that they eagerly and\\ninstantly seized the pupг¦ of f. fusca, whereas they were much terrified\\nwhen they came across the pupг¦, or even the earth from the nest of f.\\nflava, and quickly ran away; but in about a quarter of an hour, shortly\\nafter all the little yellow ants had crawled away, they took heart and\\ncarried off the pupг¦.\\n\\none evening i visited another community of f. sanguinea, and found a number\\nof these ants returning home and entering their nests, carrying the dead\\nbodies of f. fusca (showing that it was not a migration) and numerous pupг¦.\\ni traced a long file of ants burthened with booty, for about forty yards,\\nto a very thick clump of heath, whence i saw the last individual of f.\\nsanguinea emerge, carrying a pupa; but i was not able to find the desolated\\nnest in the thick heath. the nest, however, must have been close at hand,\\nfor two or three individuals of f. fusca were rushing about in the greatest\\n{223} agitation, and one was perched motionless with its own pupa in its\\nmouth on the top of a spray of heath, an image of despair, over its ravaged\\nhome.\\n\\nsuch are the facts, though they did not need confirmation by me, in regard\\nto the wonderful instinct of making slaves. let it be observed what a\\ncontrast the instinctive habits of f. sanguinea present with those of the\\ncontinental f. rufescens. the latter does not build its own nest, does not\\ndetermine its own migrations, does not collect food for itself or its\\nyoung, and cannot even feed itself: it is absolutely dependent on its\\nnumerous slaves. formica sanguinea, on the other hand, possesses much fewer\\nslaves, and in the early part of the summer extremely few: the masters\\ndetermine when and where a new nest shall be formed, and when they migrate,\\nthe masters carry the slaves. both in switzerland and england the slaves\\nseem to have the exclusive care of the larvг¦, and the masters alone go on\\nslave-making expeditions. in switzerland the slaves and masters work\\ntogether, making and bringing materials for the nest: both, but chiefly the\\nslaves, tend, and milk as it may be called, their aphides; and thus both\\ncollect food for the community. in england the masters alone usually leave\\nthe nest to collect building materials and food for themselves, their\\nslaves and larvг¦. so that the masters in this country receive much less\\nservice from their slaves than they do in switzerland.\\n\\nby what steps the instinct of f. sanguinea originated i will not pretend to\\nconjecture. but as ants, which are not slave-makers, will, as i have seen,\\ncarry off pupг¦ of other species, if scattered near their nests, it is\\npossible that such pupг¦ originally stored as food might become developed;\\nand the foreign ants thus unintentionally reared would then follow their\\nproper instincts, and do {224} what work they could. if their presence\\nproved useful to the species which had seized them--if it were more\\nadvantageous to this species to capture workers than to procreate them--the\\nhabit of collecting pupae originally for food might by natural selection be\\nstrengthened and rendered permanent for the very different purpose of\\nraising slaves. when the instinct was once acquired, if carried out to a\\nmuch less extent even than in our british f. sanguinea, which, as we have\\nseen, is less aided by its slaves than the same species in switzerland, i\\ncan see no difficulty in natural selection increasing and modifying the\\ninstinct--always supposing each modification to be of use to the\\nspecies--until an ant was formed as abjectly dependent on its slaves as is\\nthe formica rufescens.\\n\\n\\n\\n_cell-making instinct of the hive-bee._--i will not here enter on minute\\ndetails on this subject, but will merely give an outline of the conclusions\\nat which i have arrived. he must be a dull man who can examine the\\nexquisite structure of a comb, so beautifully adapted to its end, without\\nenthusiastic admiration. we hear from mathematicians that bees have\\npractically solved a recondite problem, and have made their cells of the\\nproper shape to hold the greatest possible amount of honey, with the least\\npossible consumption of precious wax in their construction. it has been\\nremarked that a skilful workman, with fitting tools and measures, would\\nfind it very difficult to make cells of wax of the true form, though this\\nis perfectly effected by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive. grant\\nwhatever instincts you please, and it seems at first quite inconceivable\\nhow they can make all the necessary angles and planes, or even perceive\\nwhen they are correctly made. but the difficulty is not {225} nearly so\\ngreat as it at first appears: all this beautiful work can be shown, i\\nthink, to follow from a few very simple instincts.\\n\\ni was led to investigate this subject by mr. waterhouse, who has shown that\\nthe form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of adjoining\\ncells; and the following view may, perhaps, be considered only as a\\nmodification of his theory. let us look to the great principle of\\ngradation, and see whether nature does not reveal to us her method of work.\\nat one end of a short series we have humble-bees, which use their old\\ncocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax, and\\nlikewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax. at the\\nother end of the series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in a\\ndouble layer: each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism, with the\\nbasal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to fit on to a pyramid, formed\\nof three rhombs. these rhombs have certain angles, and the three which form\\nthe pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb, enter into the\\ncomposition of the bases of three adjoining cells on the opposite side. in\\nthe series between the extreme perfection of the cells of the hive-bee and\\nthe simplicity of those of the humble-bee, we have the cells of the mexican\\nmelipona domestica, carefully described and figured by pierre huber. the\\nmelipona itself is intermediate in structure between the hive and humble\\nbee, but more nearly related to the latter: it forms a nearly regular waxen\\ncomb of cylindrical cells, in which the young are hatched, and, in\\naddition, some large cells of wax for holding honey. these latter cells are\\nnearly spherical and of nearly equal sizes, and are aggregated into an\\nirregular mass. but the important point to notice, is that these cells are\\nalways made at that degree of nearness to each other, that they would have\\n{226} intersected or broken into each other, if the spheres had been\\ncompleted; but this is never permitted, the bees building perfectly flat\\nwalls of wax between the spheres which thus tend to intersect. hence each\\ncell consists of an outer spherical portion and of two, three, or more\\nperfectly flat surfaces, according as the cell adjoins two, three, or more\\nother cells. when one cell comes into contact with three other cells,\\nwhich, from the spheres being nearly of the same size, is very frequently\\nand necessarily the case, the three flat surfaces are united into a\\npyramid; and this pyramid, as huber has remarked, is manifestly a gross\\nimitation of the three-sided pyramidal bases of the cell of the hive-bee.\\nas in the cells of the hive-bee, so here, the three plane surfaces in any\\none cell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells.\\nit is obvious that the melipona saves wax by this manner of building; for\\nthe flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double, but are of the\\nsame thickness as the outer spherical portions, and yet each flat portion\\nforms a part of two cells.\\n\\nreflecting on this case, it occurred to me that if the melipona had made\\nits spheres at some given distance from each other, and had made them of\\nequal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer, the\\nresulting structure would probably have been as perfect as the comb of the\\nhive-bee. accordingly i wrote to professor miller, of cambridge, and this\\ngeometer has kindly read over the following statement, drawn up from his\\ninformation, and tells me that it is strictly correct:--\\n\\nif a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in two\\nparallel layers; with the centre of each sphere at the distance of radius г—\\n[root]2, or radius г— 1.41421 (or at some lesser distance), from the centres\\nof the six surrounding spheres in the same {227} layer; and at the same\\ndistance from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the other and\\nparallel layer; then, if planes of intersection between the several spheres\\nin both layers be formed, there will result a double layer of hexagonal\\nprisms united together by pyramidal bases formed of three rhombs; and the\\nrhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will have every angle\\nidentically the same with the best measurements which have been made of the\\ncells of the hive-bee.\\n\\nhence we may safely conclude that if we could slightly modify the instincts\\nalready possessed by the melipona, and in themselves not very wonderful,\\nthis bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as that of the\\nhive-bee. we must suppose the melipona to make her cells truly spherical,\\nand of equal sizes; and this would not be very surprising, seeing that she\\nalready does so to a certain extent, and seeing what perfectly cylindrical\\nburrows in wood many insects can make, apparently by turning round on a\\nfixed point. we must suppose the melipona to arrange her cells in level\\nlayers, as she already does her cylindrical cells; and we must further\\nsuppose, and this is the greatest difficulty, that she can somehow judge\\naccurately at what distance to stand from her fellow-labourers when several\\nare making their spheres; but she is already so far enabled to judge of\\ndistance, that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect largely;\\nand then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces.\\nwe have further to suppose, but this is no difficulty, that after hexagonal\\nprisms have been formed by the intersection of adjoining spheres in the\\nsame layer, she can prolong the hexagon to any length requisite to hold the\\nstock of honey; in the same way as the rude humble-bee adds cylinders of\\nwax to the circular mouths of her old cocoons. by such {228} modifications\\nof instincts in themselves not very wonderful,--hardly more wonderful than\\nthose which guide a bird to make its nest,--i believe that the hive-bee has\\nacquired, through natural selection, her inimitable architectural powers.\\n\\nbut this theory can be tested by experiment. following the example of mr.\\ntegetmeier, i separated two combs, and put between them a long, thick,\\nsquare strip of wax: the bees instantly began to excavate minute circular\\npits in it; and as they deepened these little pits, they made them wider\\nand wider until they were converted into shallow basins, appearing to the\\neye perfectly true or parts of a sphere, and of about the diameter of a\\ncell. it was most interesting to me to observe that wherever several bees\\nhad begun to excavate these basins near together, they had begun their work\\nat such a distance from each other, that by the time the basins had\\nacquired the above stated width (_i.e._ about the width of an ordinary\\ncell), and were in depth about one sixth of the diameter of the sphere of\\nwhich they formed a part, the rims of the basins intersected or broke into\\neach other. as soon as this occurred, the bees ceased to excavate, and\\nbegan to build up flat walls of wax on the lines of intersection between\\nthe basins, so that each hexagonal prism was built upon the scalloped edge\\nof a smooth basin, instead of on the straight edges of a three-sided\\npyramid as in the case of ordinary cells.\\n\\ni then put into the hive, instead of a thick, square piece of wax, a thin\\nand narrow, knife-edged ridge, coloured with vermilion. the bees instantly\\nbegan on both sides to excavate little basins near to each other, in the\\nsame way as before; but the ridge of wax was so thin, that the bottoms of\\nthe basins, if they had been excavated to the same depth as in the former\\n{229} experiment, would have broken into each other from the opposite\\nsides. the bees, however, did not suffer this to happen, and they stopped\\ntheir excavations in due time; so that the basins, as soon as they had been\\na little deepened, came to have flat bottoms; and these flat bottoms,\\nformed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax having been left\\nungnawed, were situated, as far as the eye could judge, exactly along the\\nplanes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite sides\\nof the ridge of wax. in parts, only little bits, in other parts, large\\nportions of a rhombic plate had been left between the opposed basins, but\\nthe work, from the unnatural state of things, had not been neatly\\nperformed. the bees must have worked at very nearly the same rate on the\\nopposite sides of the ridge of vermilion wax, as they circularly gnawed\\naway and deepened the basins on both sides, in order to have succeeded in\\nthus leaving flat plates between the basins, by stopping work along the\\nintermediate planes or planes of intersection.\\n\\nconsidering how flexible thin wax is, i do not see that there is any\\ndifficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip of wax,\\nperceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper thinness, and\\nthen stopping their work. in ordinary combs it has appeared to me that the\\nbees do not always succeed in working at exactly the same rate from the\\nopposite sides; for i have noticed half-completed rhombs at the base of a\\njust-commenced cell, which were slightly concave on one side, where i\\nsuppose that the bees had excavated too quickly, and convex on the opposed\\nside, where the bees had worked less quickly. in one well-marked instance,\\ni put the comb back into the hive, and allowed the bees to go on working\\nfor a short time, and again examined the cell, and i found that the rhombic\\n{230} plate had been completed, and had become _perfectly flat_: it was\\nabsolutely impossible, from the extreme thinness of the little rhombic\\nplate, that they could have effected this by gnawing away the convex side;\\nand i suspect that the bees in such cases stand in the opposed cells and\\npush and bend the ductile and warm wax (which as i have tried is easily\\ndone) into its proper intermediate plane, and thus flatten it.\\n\\nfrom the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax, we can clearly see that\\nif the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax, they could\\nmake their cells of the proper shape, by standing at the proper distance\\nfrom each other, by excavating at the same rate, and by endeavouring to\\nmake equal spherical hollows, but never allowing the spheres to break into\\neach other. now bees, as may be clearly seen by examining the edge of a\\ngrowing comb, do make a rough, circumferential wall or rim all round the\\ncomb; and they gnaw into this from the opposite sides, always working\\ncircularly as they deepen each cell. they do not make the whole three-sided\\npyramidal base of any one cell at the same time, but only the one rhombic\\nplate which stands on the extreme growing margin, or the two plates, as the\\ncase may be; and they never complete the upper edges of the rhombic plates,\\nuntil the hexagonal walls are commenced. some of these statements differ\\nfrom those made by the justly celebrated elder huber, but i am convinced of\\ntheir accuracy; and if i had space, i could show that they are conformable\\nwith my theory.\\n\\nhuber\\'s statement that the very first cell is excavated out of a little\\nparallel-sided wall of wax, is not, as far as i have seen, strictly\\ncorrect; the first commencement having always been a little hood of wax;\\nbut i will not here enter on these details. we see how important {231} a\\npart excavation plays in the construction of the cells; but it would be a\\ngreat error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax in\\nthe proper position--that is, along the plane of intersection between two\\nadjoining spheres. i have several specimens showing clearly that they can\\ndo this. even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax round a\\ngrowing comb, flexures may sometimes be observed, corresponding in position\\nto the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells. but the rough\\nwall of wax has in every case to be finished off, by being largely gnawed\\naway on both sides. the manner in which the bees build is curious; they\\nalways make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times thicker than the\\nexcessively thin finished wall of the cell, which will ultimately be left.\\nwe shall understand how they work, by supposing masons first to pile up a\\nbroad ridge of cement, and then to begin cutting it away equally on both\\nsides near the ground, till a smooth, very thin wall is left in the middle;\\nthe masons always piling up the cut-away cement, and adding fresh cement,\\non the summit of the ridge. we shall thus have a thin wall steadily growing\\nupward; but always crowned by a gigantic coping. from all the cells, both\\nthose just commenced and those completed, being thus crowned by a strong\\ncoping of wax, the bees can cluster and crawl over the comb without\\ninjuring the delicate hexagonal walls, which are only about one\\nfour-hundredth of an inch in thickness; the plates of the pyramidal basis\\nbeing about twice as thick. by this singular manner of building, strength\\nis continually given to the comb, with the utmost ultimate economy of wax.\\n\\nit seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the cells\\nare made, that a multitude of bees all work together; one bee after working\\na short time at one cell going to another, so that, as huber has stated,\\n{232} a score of individuals work even at the commencement of the first\\ncell. i was able practically to show this fact, by covering the edges of\\nthe hexagonal walls of a single cell, or the extreme margin of the\\ncircumferential rim of a growing comb, with an extremely thin layer of\\nmelted vermilion wax; and i invariably found that the colour was most\\ndelicately diffused by the bees--as delicately as a painter could have done\\nwith his brush--by atoms of the coloured wax having been taken from the\\nspot on which it had been placed, and worked into the growing edges of the\\ncells all round. the work of construction seems to be a sort of balance\\nstruck between many bees, all instinctively standing at the same relative\\ndistance from each other, all trying to sweep equal spheres, and then\\nbuilding up, or leaving ungnawed, the planes of intersection between these\\nspheres. it was really curious to note in cases of difficulty, as when two\\npieces of comb met at an angle, how often the bees would pull down and\\nrebuild in different ways the same cell, sometimes recurring to a shape\\nwhich they had at first rejected.\\n\\nwhen bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions\\nfor working,--for instance, on a slip of wood, placed directly under the\\nmiddle of a comb growing downwards so that the comb has to be built over\\none face of the slip--in this case the bees can lay the foundations of one\\nwall of a new hexagon, in its strictly proper place, projecting beyond the\\nother completed cells. it suffices that the bees should be enabled to stand\\nat their proper relative distances from each other and from the walls of\\nthe last completed cells, and then, by striking imaginary spheres, they can\\nbuild up a wall intermediate between two adjoining spheres; but, as far as\\ni have seen, they never gnaw away and finish off the angles of a cell till\\na large part both of that cell and of {233} the adjoining cells has been\\nbuilt. this capacity in bees of laying down under certain circumstances a\\nrough wall in its proper place between two just-commenced cells, is\\nimportant, as it bears on a fact, which seems at first quite subversive of\\nthe foregoing theory; namely, that the cells on the extreme margin of\\nwasp-combs are sometimes strictly hexagonal; but i have not space here to\\nenter on this subject. nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a\\nsingle insect (as in the case of a queen-wasp) making hexagonal cells, if\\nshe work alternately on the inside and outside of two or three cells\\ncommenced at the same time, always standing at the proper relative distance\\nfrom the parts of the cells just begun, sweeping spheres or cylinders, and\\nbuilding up intermediate planes. it is even conceivable that an insect\\nmight, by fixing on a point at which to commence a cell, and then moving\\noutside, first to one point, and then to five other points, at the proper\\nrelative distances from the central point and from each other, strike the\\nplanes of intersection, and so make an isolated hexagon: but i am not aware\\nthat any such case has been observed; nor would any good be derived from a\\nsingle hexagon being built, as in its construction more materials would be\\nrequired than for a cylinder.\\n\\nas natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight modifications\\nof structure or instinct, each profitable to the individual under its\\nconditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how a long and graduated\\nsuccession of modified architectural instincts, all tending towards the\\npresent perfect plan of construction, could have profited the progenitors\\nof the hive-bee? i think the answer is not difficult: it is known that bees\\nare often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar; and i am informed by mr.\\ntegetmeier that it has been experimentally found that no less than from\\ntwelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar {234} are consumed by a hive of bees\\nfor the secretion of each pound of wax; to that a prodigious quantity of\\nfluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in a hive for the\\nsecretion of the wax necessary for the construction of their combs.\\nmoreover, many bees have to remain idle for many days during the process of\\nsecretion. a large store of honey is indispensable to support a large stock\\nof bees during the winter; and the security of the hive is known mainly to\\ndepend on a large number of bees being supported. hence the saving of wax\\nby largely saving honey must be a most important element of success in any\\nfamily of bees. of course the success of any species of bee may be\\ndependent on the number of its parasites or other enemies, or on quite\\ndistinct causes, and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey\\nwhich the bees could collect. but let us suppose that this latter\\ncircumstance determined, as it probably often does determine, the numbers\\nof a humble-bee which could exist in a country; and let us further suppose\\nthat the community lived throughout the winter, and consequently required a\\nstore of honey: there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an\\nadvantage to our humble-bee, if a slight modification of her instinct led\\nher to make her waxen cells near together, so as to intersect a little; for\\na wall in common even to two adjoining cells, would save some little wax.\\nhence it would continually be more and more advantageous to our humble-bee,\\nif she were to make her cells more and more regular, nearer together, and\\naggregated into a mass, like the cells of the melipona; for in this case a\\nlarge part of the bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound other\\ncells, and much wax would be saved. again, from the same cause, it would be\\nadvantageous to the melipona, if she were to make her cells closer\\ntogether, and more regular in every way {235} than at present; for then, as\\nwe have seen, the spherical surfaces would wholly disappear, and would all\\nbe replaced by plane surfaces; and the melipona would make a comb as\\nperfect as that of the hive-bee. beyond this stage of perfection in\\narchitecture, natural selection could not lead; for the comb of the\\nhive-bee, as far as we can see, is absolutely perfect in economising wax.\\n\\nthus, as i believe, the most wonderful of all known instincts, that of the\\nhive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having taken advantage of\\nnumerous, successive, slight modifications of simpler instincts; natural\\nselection having by slow degrees, more and more perfectly, led the bees to\\nsweep equal spheres at a given distance from each other in a double layer,\\nand to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection. the\\nbees, of course, no more knowing that they swept their spheres at one\\nparticular distance from each other, than they know what are the several\\nangles of the hexagonal prisms and of the basal rhombic plates. the motive\\npower of the process of natural selection having been economy of wax; that\\nindividual swarm which wasted least honey in the secretion of wax, having\\nsucceeded best, and having transmitted by inheritance its newly acquired\\neconomical instinct to new swarms, which in their turn will have had the\\nbest chance of succeeding in the struggle for existence.\\n\\n\\n\\nno doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed to\\nthe theory of natural selection,--cases, in which we cannot see how an\\ninstinct could possibly have originated; cases, in which no intermediate\\ngradations are known to exist; cases of instinct of apparently such\\ntrifling importance, that they could {236} hardly have been acted on by\\nnatural selection; cases of instincts almost identically the same in\\nanimals so remote in the scale of nature, that we cannot account for their\\nsimilarity by inheritance from a common parent, and must therefore believe\\nthat they have been acquired by independent acts of natural selection. i\\nwill not here enter on these several cases, but will confine myself to one\\nspecial difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually\\nfatal to my whole theory. i allude to the neuters or sterile females in\\ninsect-communities: for these neuters often differ widely in instinct and\\nin structure from both the males and fertile females, and yet, from being\\nsterile, they cannot propagate their kind.\\n\\nthe subject well deserves to be discussed at great length, but i will here\\ntake only a single case, that of working or sterile ants. how the workers\\nhave been rendered sterile is a difficulty; but not much greater than that\\nof any other striking modification of structure; for it can be shown that\\nsome insects and other articulate animals in a state of nature occasionally\\nbecome sterile; and if such insects had been social, and it had been\\nprofitable to the community that a number should have been annually born\\ncapable of work, but incapable of procreation, i can see no very great\\ndifficulty in this being effected by natural selection. but i must pass\\nover this preliminary difficulty. the great difficulty lies in the working\\nants differing widely from both the males and the fertile females in\\nstructure, as in the shape of the thorax and in being destitute of wings\\nand sometimes of eyes, and in instinct. as far as instinct alone is\\nconcerned, the prodigious difference in this respect between the workers\\nand the perfect females, would have been far better exemplified by the\\nhive-bee. if a working ant or other neuter insect had been an animal {237}\\nin the ordinary state, i should have unhesitatingly assumed that all its\\ncharacters had been slowly acquired through natural selection; namely, by\\nan individual having been born with some slight profitable modification of\\nstructure, this being inherited by its offspring, which again varied and\\nwere again selected, and so onwards. but with the working ant we have an\\ninsect differing greatly from its parents, yet absolutely sterile; so that\\nit could never have transmitted successively acquired modifications of\\nstructure or instinct to its progeny. it may well be asked how is it\\npossible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection?\\n\\nfirst, let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances, both in our\\ndomestic productions and in those in a state of nature, of all sorts of\\ndifferences of structure which have become correlated to certain ages, and\\nto either sex. we have differences correlated not only to one sex, but to\\nthat short period alone when the reproductive system is active, as in the\\nnuptial plumage of many birds, and in the hooked jaws of the male salmon.\\nwe have even slight differences in the horns of different breeds of cattle\\nin relation to an artificially imperfect state of the male sex; for oxen of\\ncertain breeds have longer horns than in other breeds, in comparison with\\nthe horns of the bulls or cows of these same breeds. hence i can see no\\nreal difficulty in any character having become correlated with the sterile\\ncondition of certain members of insect-communities: the difficulty lies in\\nunderstanding how such correlated modifications of structure could have\\nbeen slowly accumulated by natural selection.\\n\\nthis difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, or, as i\\nbelieve, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied to\\nthe family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the {238}\\ndesired end. thus, a well-flavoured vegetable is cooked, and the individual\\nis destroyed; but the horticulturist sows seeds of the same stock, and\\nconfidently expects to get nearly the same variety: breeders of cattle wish\\nthe flesh and fat to be well marbled together; the animal has been\\nslaughtered, but the breeder goes with confidence to the same family. i\\nhave such faith in the powers of selection, that i do not doubt that a\\nbreed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns,\\ncould be slowly formed by carefully watching which individual bulls and\\ncows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest horns; and yet no one ox\\ncould ever have propagated its kind. thus i believe it has been with social\\ninsects: a slight modification of structure, or instinct, correlated with\\nthe sterile condition of certain members of the community, has been\\nadvantageous to the community: consequently the fertile males and females\\nof the same community flourished, and transmitted to their fertile\\noffspring a tendency to produce sterile members having the same\\nmodification. and i believe that this process has been repeated, until that\\nprodigious amount of difference between the fertile and sterile females of\\nthe same species has been produced, which we see in many social insects.\\n\\nbut we have not as yet touched on the climax of the difficulty; namely, the\\nfact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only from the fertile\\nfemales and males, but from each other, sometimes to an almost incredible\\ndegree, and are thus divided into two or even three castes. the castes,\\nmoreover, do not generally graduate into each other, but are perfectly well\\ndefined; being as distinct from each other, as are any two species of the\\nsame genus, or rather as any two genera of the same family. thus in eciton,\\nthere are working and soldier neuters, with jaws and instincts\\nextraordinarily {239} different: in cryptocerus, the workers of one caste\\nalone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads, the use of which is\\nquite unknown: in the mexican myrmecocystus, the workers of one caste never\\nleave the nest; they are fed by the workers of another caste, and they have\\nan enormously developed abdomen which secretes a sort of honey, supplying\\nthe place of that excreted by the aphides, or the domestic cattle as they\\nmay be called, which our european ants guard or imprison.\\n\\nit will indeed be thought that i have an overweening confidence in the\\nprinciple of natural selection, when i do not admit that such wonderful and\\nwell-established facts at once annihilate my theory. in the simpler case of\\nneuter insects all of one caste or of the same kind, which have been\\nrendered by natural selection, as i believe to be quite possible, different\\nfrom the fertile males and females,--in this case, we may safely conclude\\nfrom the analogy of ordinary variations, that each successive, slight,\\nprofitable modification did not probably at first appear in all the\\nindividual neuters in the same nest, but in a few alone; and that by the\\nlong-continued selection of the fertile parents which produced most neuters\\nwith the profitable modification, all the neuters ultimately came to have\\nthe desired character. on this view we ought occasionally to find\\nneuter-insects of the same species, in the same nest, presenting gradations\\nof structure; and this we do find, even often, considering how few\\nneuter-insects out of europe have been carefully examined. mr. f. smith has\\nshown how surprisingly the neuters of several british ants differ from each\\nother in size and sometimes in colour; and that the extreme forms can\\nsometimes be perfectly linked together by individuals taken out of the same\\nnest: i have myself compared perfect gradations of this kind. it often\\nhappens that the larger or the smaller sized workers {240} are the most\\nnumerous; or that both large and small are numerous, with those of an\\nintermediate size scanty in numbers. formica flava has larger and smaller\\nworkers, with some of intermediate size; and, in this species, as mr. f.\\nsmith has observed, the larger workers have simple eyes (ocelli), which\\nthough small can be plainly distinguished, whereas the smaller workers have\\ntheir ocelli rudimentary. having carefully dissected several specimens of\\nthese workers, i can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the\\nsmaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionally\\nlesser size; and i fully believe, though i dare not assert so positively,\\nthat the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly\\nintermediate condition. so that we here have two bodies of sterile workers\\nin the same nest, differing not only in size, but in their organs of\\nvision, yet connected by some few members in an intermediate condition. i\\nmay digress by adding, that if the smaller workers had been the most useful\\nto the community, and those males and females had been continually\\nselected, which produced more and more of the smaller workers, until all\\nthe workers had come to be in this condition; we should then have had a\\nspecies of ant with neuters very nearly in the same condition with those of\\nmyrmica. for the workers of myrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli,\\nthough the male and female ants of this genus have well-developed ocelli.\\n\\ni may give one other case: so confidently did i expect to find gradations\\nin important points of structure between the different castes of neuters in\\nthe same species, that i gladly availed myself of mr. f. smith\\'s offer of\\nnumerous specimens from the same nest of the driver ant (anomma) of west\\nafrica. the reader will perhaps best appreciate the amount of difference in\\nthese {241} workers, by my giving not the actual measurements, but a\\nstrictly accurate illustration: the difference was the same as if we were\\nto see a set of workmen building a house of whom many were five feet four\\ninches high, and many sixteen feet high; but we must suppose that the\\nlarger workmen had heads four instead of three times as big as those of the\\nsmaller men, and jaws nearly five times as big. the jaws, moreover, of the\\nworking ants of the several sizes differed wonderfully in shape, and in the\\nform and number of the teeth. but the important fact for us is, that though\\nthe workers can be grouped into castes of different sizes, yet they\\ngraduate insensibly into each other, as does the widely-different structure\\nof their jaws. i speak confidently on this latter point, as mr. lubbock\\nmade drawings for me with the camera lucida of the jaws which i had\\ndissected from the workers of the several sizes.\\n\\nwith these facts before me, i believe that natural selection, by acting on\\nthe fertile parents, could form a species which should regularly produce\\nneuters, either all of large size with one form of jaw, or all of small\\nsize with jaws having a widely different structure; or lastly, and this is\\nour climax of difficulty, one set of workers of one size and structure, and\\nsimultaneously another set of workers of a different size and structure;--a\\ngraduated series having been first formed, as in the case of the driver\\nant, and then the extreme forms, from being the most useful to the\\ncommunity, having been produced in greater and greater numbers through the\\nnatural selection of the parents which generated them; until none with an\\nintermediate structure were produced.\\n\\nthus, as i believe, the wonderful fact of two distinctly defined castes of\\nsterile workers existing in the same nest, both widely different from each\\nother and from {242} their parents, has originated. we can see how useful\\ntheir production may have been to a social community of insects, on the\\nsame principle that the division of labour is useful to civilised man. as\\nants work by inherited instincts and by inherited organs or tools, and not\\nby acquired knowledge and manufactured instruments, a perfect division of\\nlabour could be effected with them only by the workers being sterile; for\\nhad they been fertile, they would have intercrossed, and their instincts\\nand structure would have become blended. and nature has, as i believe,\\neffected this admirable division of labour in the communities of ants, by\\nthe means of natural selection. but i am bound to confess, that, with all\\nmy faith in this principle, i should never have anticipated that natural\\nselection could have been efficient in so high a degree, had not the case\\nof these neuter insects convinced me of the fact. i have, therefore,\\ndiscussed this case, at some little but wholly insufficient length, in\\norder to show the power of natural selection, and likewise because this is\\nby far the most serious special difficulty, which my theory has\\nencountered. the case, also, is very interesting, as it proves that with\\nanimals, as with plants, any amount of modification in structure can be\\neffected by the accumulation of numerous, slight, and as we must call them\\naccidental, variations, which are in any manner profitable, without\\nexercise or habit having come into play. for no amount of exercise, or\\nhabit, or volition, in the utterly sterile members of a community could\\npossibly affect the structure or instincts of the fertile members, which\\nalone leave descendants. i am surprised that no one has advanced this\\ndemonstrative case of neuter insects, against the well-known doctrine of\\nlamarck.\\n\\n\\n\\n_summary._--i have endeavoured briefly in this chapter {243} to show that\\nthe mental qualities of our domestic animals vary, and that the variations\\nare inherited. still more briefly i have attempted to show that instincts\\nvary slightly in a state of nature. no one will dispute that instincts are\\nof the highest importance to each animal. therefore i can see no\\ndifficulty, under changing conditions of life, in natural selection\\naccumulating slight modifications of instinct to any extent, in any useful\\ndirection. in some cases habit or use and disuse have probably come into\\nplay. i do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter strengthen in\\nany great degree my theory; but none of the cases of difficulty, to the\\nbest of my judgment, annihilate it. on the other hand, the fact that\\ninstincts are not always absolutely perfect and are liable to\\nmistakes;--that no instinct has been produced for the exclusive good of\\nother animals, but that each animal takes advantage of the instincts of\\nothers;--that the canon in natural history, of \"natura non facit saltum,\"\\nis applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal structure, and is\\nplainly explicable on the foregoing views, but is otherwise\\ninexplicable,--all tend to corroborate the theory of natural selection.\\n\\nthis theory is, also, strengthened by some few other facts in regard to\\ninstincts; as by that common case of closely allied, but certainly\\ndistinct, species, when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living\\nunder considerably different conditions of life, yet often retaining nearly\\nthe same instincts. for instance, we can understand on the principle of\\ninheritance, how it is that the thrush of south america lines its nest with\\nmud, in the same peculiar manner as does our british thrush: how it is that\\nthe male wrens (troglodytes) of north america, build \"cock-nests,\" to roost\\nin, like the males of our distinct kitty-wrens,--a habit wholly unlike that\\nof {244} any other known bird. finally, it may not be a logical deduction,\\nbut to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts\\nas the young cuckoo ejecting its foster-brothers,--ants making slaves,--the\\nlarvae of ichneumonidг¦ feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars,--not\\nas specially endowed or created instincts, but as small consequences of one\\ngeneral law, leading to the advancement of all organic beings, namely,\\nmultiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.\\n\\n       *       *

been specially endowed with the quality of sterility, in\\norder to prevent the confusion of all organic forms. this view certainly\\nseems at first probable, for species within the same country could hardly\\nhave kept distinct had they been capable of crossing freely. the importance\\nof the fact that hybrids are very generally sterile, has, i think, been\\nmuch underrated by some late writers. on the theory of natural selection\\nthe case is especially important, inasmuch as the sterility of hybrids\\ncould not possibly be of any advantage to them, and therefore could not\\nhave been acquired by the continued preservation of successive profitable\\ndegrees of sterility. i hope, however, to be able to show that sterility is\\nnot a specially acquired or endowed quality, but is incidental on other\\nacquired differences.\\n\\nin treating this subject, two classes of facts, to a large extent\\nfundamentally different, have generally been confounded together; namely,\\nthe sterility of two species {246} when first crossed, and the sterility of\\nthe hybrids produced from them.\\n\\npure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect\\ncondition, yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no offspring.\\nhybrids, on the other hand, have their reproductive organs functionally\\nimpotent, as may be clearly seen in the state of the male element in both\\nplants and animals; though the organs themselves are perfect in structure,\\nas far as the microscope reveals. in the first case the two sexual elements\\nwhich go to form the embryo are perfect; in the second case they are either\\nnot at all developed, or are imperfectly developed. this distinction is\\nimportant, when the cause of the sterility, which is common to the two\\ncases, has to be considered. the distinction has probably been slurred\\nover, owing to the sterility in both cases being looked on as a special\\nendowment, beyond the province of our reasoning powers.\\n\\nthe fertility of varieties, that is of the forms known or believed to have\\ndescended from common parents, when intercrossed, and likewise the\\nfertility of their mongrel offspring, is, on my theory, of equal importance\\nwith the sterility of species; for it seems to make a broad and clear\\ndistinction between varieties and species.\\n\\nfirst, for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid\\noffspring. it is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of those\\ntwo conscientious and admirable observers, kг¶lreuter and gг¤rtner, who\\nalmost devoted their lives to this subject, without being deeply impressed\\nwith the high generality of some degree of sterility. kг¶lreuter makes the\\nrule universal; but then he cuts the knot, for in ten cases in which he\\nfound two forms, considered by most authors as distinct species, quite\\nfertile together, he unhesitatingly ranks {247} them as varieties. gг¤rtner,\\nalso, makes the rule equally universal; and he disputes the entire\\nfertility of kг¶lreuter\\'s ten cases. but in these and in many other cases,\\ngг¤rtner is obliged carefully to count the seeds, in order to show that\\nthere is any degree of sterility. he always compares the maximum number of\\nseeds produced by two species when crossed and by their hybrid offspring,\\nwith the average number produced by both pure parent-species in a state of\\nnature. but a serious cause of error seems to me to be here introduced: a\\nplant to be hybridised must be castrated, and, what is often more\\nimportant, must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being brought to it\\nby insects from other plants. nearly all the plants experimentised on by\\ngг¤rtner were potted, and apparently were kept in a chamber in his house.\\nthat these processes are often injurious to the fertility of a plant cannot\\nbe doubted; for gг¤rtner gives in his table about a score of cases of plants\\nwhich he castrated, and artificially fertilised with their own pollen, and\\n(excluding all cases such as the leguminosг¦, in which there is an\\nacknowledged difficulty in the manipulation) half of these twenty plants\\nhad their fertility in some degree impaired. moreover, as gг¤rtner during\\nseveral years repeatedly crossed the primrose and cowslip, which we have\\nsuch good reason to believe to be varieties, and only once or twice\\nsucceeded in getting fertile seed; as he found the common red and blue\\npimpernels (anagallis arvensis and coerulea), which the best botanists rank\\nas varieties, absolutely sterile together; and as he came to the same\\nconclusion in several other analogous cases; it seems to me that we may\\nwell be permitted to doubt whether many other species are really so\\nsterile, when intercrossed, as gг¤rtner believes. {248}\\n\\nit is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various species when\\ncrossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly, and, on\\nthe other hand, that the fertility of pure species is so easily affected by\\nvarious circumstances, that for all practical purposes it is most difficult\\nto say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins. i think no better\\nevidence of this can be required than that the two most experienced\\nobservers who have ever lived, namely, kг¶lreuter and gг¤rtner, should have\\narrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to the very same\\nspecies. it is also most instructive to compare--but i have not space here\\nto enter on details--the evidence advanced by our best botanists on the\\nquestion whether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or\\nvarieties, with the evidence from fertility adduced by different\\nhybridisers, or by the same author, from experiments made during different\\nyears. it can thus be shown that neither sterility nor fertility affords\\nany clear distinction between species and varieties; but that the evidence\\nfrom this source graduates away, and is doubtful in the same degree as is\\nthe evidence derived from other constitutional and structural differences.\\n\\nin regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations; though\\ngг¤rtner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding them from a\\ncross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in one case for ten\\ngenerations, yet he asserts positively that their fertility never\\nincreased, but generally greatly decreased. i do not doubt that this is\\nusually the case, and that the fertility often suddenly decreases in the\\nfirst few generations. nevertheless i believe that in all these experiments\\nthe fertility has been diminished by an independent cause, namely, from\\nclose interbreeding. i have collected so large a body of facts, showing\\n{249} that close interbreeding lessens fertility, and, on the other hand,\\nthat an occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases\\nfertility, that i cannot doubt the correctness of this almost universal\\nbelief amongst breeders. hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in\\ngreat numbers; and as the parent-species, or other allied hybrids,\\ngenerally grow in the same garden, the visits of insects must be carefully\\nprevented during the flowering season: hence hybrids will generally be\\nfertilised during each generation by their own individual pollen; and i am\\nconvinced that this would be injurious to their fertility, already lessened\\nby their hybrid origin. i am strengthened in this conviction by a\\nremarkable statement repeatedly made by gг¤rtner, namely, that if even the\\nless fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the\\nsame kind, their fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill effects of\\nmanipulation, sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on increasing. now,\\nin artificial fertilisation pollen is as often taken by chance (as i know\\nfrom my own experience) from the anthers of another flower, as from the\\nanthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised; so that a cross\\nbetween two flowers, though probably on the same plant, would be thus\\neffected. moreover, whenever complicated experiments are in progress, so\\ncareful an observer as gг¤rtner would have castrated his hybrids, and this\\nwould have insured in each generation a cross with a pollen from a distinct\\nflower, either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid\\nnature. and thus, the strange fact of the increase of fertility in the\\nsuccessive generations of _artificially fertilised_ hybrids may, i believe,\\nbe accounted for by close interbreeding having been avoided.\\n\\nnow let us turn to the results arrived at by the third most experienced\\nhybridiser, namely, the hon. and {250} rev. w. herbert. he is as emphatic\\nin his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile--as fertile as\\nthe pure parent-species--as are kг¶lreuter and gг¤rtner that some degree of\\nsterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature. he\\nexperimentised on some of the very same species as did gг¤rtner. the\\ndifference in their results may, i think, be in part accounted for by\\nherbert\\'s great horticultural skill, and by his having hothouses at his\\ncommand. of his many important statements i will here give only a single\\none as an example, namely, that \"every ovule in a pod of crinum capense\\nfertilised by c. revolutum produced a plant, which (he says) i never saw to\\noccur in a case of its natural fecundation.\" so that we here have perfect,\\nor even more than commonly perfect, fertility in a first cross between two\\ndistinct species.\\n\\nthis case of the crinum leads me to refer to a most singular fact, namely,\\nthat there are individual plants of certain species of lobelia and of some\\nother genera, which can be far more easily fertilised by the pollen of\\nanother and distinct species, than by their own pollen; and all the\\nindividuals of nearly all the species of hippeastrum seem to be in this\\npredicament. for these plants have been found to yield seed to the pollen\\nof a distinct species, though quite sterile with their own pollen,\\nnotwithstanding that their own pollen was found to be perfectly good, for\\nit fertilised distinct species. so that certain individual plants and all\\nthe individuals of certain species can actually be hybridised much more\\nreadily than they can be self-fertilised! for instance, a bulb of\\nhippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers; three were fertilised by herbert\\nwith their own pollen, and the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the\\npollen of a compound hybrid descended from three other and distinct {251}\\nspecies: the result was that \"the ovaries of the three first flowers soon\\nceased to grow, and after a few days perished entirely, whereas the pod\\nimpregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid\\nprogress to maturity, and bore good seed, which vegetated freely.\" in a\\nletter to me, in 1839, mr. herbert told me that he had then tried the\\nexperiment during five years, and he continued to try it during several\\nsubsequent years, and always with the same result. this result has, also,\\nbeen confirmed by other observers in the case of hippeastrum with its\\nsub-genera, and in the case of some other genera, as lobelia, passiflora\\nand verbascum. although the plants in these experiments appeared perfectly\\nhealthy, and although both the ovules and pollen of the same flower were\\nperfectly good with respect to other species, yet as they were functionally\\nimperfect in their mutual self-action, we must infer that the plants were\\nin an unnatural state. nevertheless these facts show on what slight and\\nmysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of species when crossed,\\nin comparison with the same species when self-fertilised, sometimes\\ndepends.\\n\\nthe practical experiments of horticulturists, though not made with\\nscientific precision, deserve some notice. it is notorious in how\\ncomplicated a manner the species of pelargonium, fuchsia, calceolaria,\\npetunia, rhododendron, &c., have been crossed, yet many of these hybrids\\nseed freely. for instance, herbert asserts that a hybrid from calceolaria\\nintegrifolia and plantaginea, species most widely dissimilar in general\\nhabit, \"reproduced itself as perfectly as if it had been a natural species\\nfrom the mountains of chile.\" i have taken some pains to ascertain the\\ndegree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of rhododendrons, and i\\nam assured that many of them {252} are perfectly fertile. mr. c. noble, for\\ninstance, informs me that he raises stocks for grafting from a hybrid\\nbetween rhod. ponticum and catawbiense, and that this hybrid \"seeds as\\nfreely as it is possible to imagine.\" had hybrids, when fairly treated,\\ngone on decreasing in fertility in each successive generation, as gг¤rtner\\nbelieves to be the case, the fact would have been notorious to nurserymen.\\nhorticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrids, and such alone are\\nfairly treated, for by insect agency the several individuals of the same\\nhybrid variety are allowed to freely cross with each other, and the\\ninjurious influence of close interbreeding is thus prevented. any one may\\nreadily convince himself of the efficiency of insect-agency by examining\\nthe flowers of the more sterile kinds of hybrid rhododendrons, which\\nproduce no pollen, for he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen\\nbrought from other flowers.\\n\\nin regard to animals, much fewer experiments have been carefully tried than\\nwith plants. if our systematic arrangements can be trusted, that is if the\\ngenera of animals are as distinct from each other, as are the genera of\\nplants, then we may infer that animals more widely separated in the scale\\nof nature can be more easily crossed than in the case of plants; but the\\nhybrids themselves are, i think, more sterile. i doubt whether any case of\\na perfectly fertile hybrid animal can be considered as thoroughly well\\nauthenticated. it should, however, be borne in mind that, owing to few\\nanimals breeding freely under confinement, few experiments have been fairly\\ntried: for instance, the canary-bird has been crossed with nine other\\nfinches, but as not one of these nine species breeds freely in confinement,\\nwe have no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the\\ncanary, or that their hybrids, {253} should be perfectly fertile. again,\\nwith respect to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile\\nhybrid animals, i hardly know of an instance in which two families of the\\nsame hybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents, so as\\nto avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding. on the contrary, brothers\\nand sisters have usually been crossed in each successive generation, in\\nopposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every breeder. and in\\nthis case, it is not at all surprising that the inherent sterility in the\\nhybrids should have gone on increasing. if we were to act thus, and pair\\nbrothers and sisters in the case of any pure animal, which from any cause\\nhad the least tendency to sterility, the breed would assuredly be lost in a\\nvery few generations.\\n\\nalthough i do not know of any thoroughly well-authenticated cases of\\nperfectly fertile hybrid animals, i have some reason to believe that the\\nhybrids from cervulus vaginalis and reevesii, and from phasianus colchicus\\nwith p. torquatus and with p. versicolor are perfectly fertile. there is no\\ndoubt that these three pheasants, namely, the common, the true ring-necked,\\nand the japan, intercross, and are becoming blended together in the woods\\nof several parts of england. the hybrids from the common and chinese geese\\n(a. cygnoides), species which are so different that they are generally\\nranked in distinct genera, have often bred in this country with either pure\\nparent, and in one single instance they have bred _inter se_. this was\\neffected by mr. eyton, who raised two hybrids from the same parents but\\nfrom different hatches; and from these two birds he raised no less than\\neight hybrids (grandchildren of the pure geese) from one nest. in india,\\nhowever, these cross-bred geese must be far more fertile; for i am assured\\nby two eminently capable judges, namely {254} mr. blyth and capt. hutton,\\nthat whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of the\\ncountry; and as they are kept for profit, where neither pure parent-species\\nexists, they must certainly be highly fertile.\\n\\na doctrine which originated with pallas, has been largely accepted by\\nmodern naturalists; namely, that most of our domestic animals have\\ndescended from two or more wild species, since commingled by intercrossing.\\non this view, the aboriginal species must either at first have produced\\nquite fertile hybrids, or the hybrids must have become in subsequent\\ngenerations quite fertile under domestication. this latter alternative\\nseems to me the most probable, and i am inclined to believe in its truth,\\nalthough it rests on no direct evidence. i believe, for instance, that our\\ndogs have descended from several wild stocks; yet, with perhaps the\\nexception of certain indigenous domestic dogs of south america, all are\\nquite fertile together; and analogy makes me greatly doubt, whether the\\nseveral aboriginal species would at first have freely bred together and\\nhave produced quite fertile hybrids. so again there is reason to believe\\nthat our european and the humped indian cattle are quite fertile together;\\nbut from facts communicated to me by mr. blyth, i think they must be\\nconsidered as distinct species. on this view of the origin of many of our\\ndomestic animals, we must either give up the belief of the almost universal\\nsterility of distinct species of animals when crossed; or we must look at\\nsterility, not as an indelible characteristic, but as one capable of being\\nremoved by domestication.\\n\\nfinally, looking to all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of\\nplants and animals, it may be concluded that some degree of sterility, both\\nin first crosses {255} and in hybrids, is an extremely general result; but\\nthat it cannot, under our present state of knowledge, be considered as\\nabsolutely universal.\\n\\n\\n\\n_laws governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids._--we will\\nnow consider a little more in detail the circumstances and rules governing\\nthe sterility of first crosses and of hybrids. our chief object will be to\\nsee whether or not the rules indicate that species have specially been\\nendowed with this quality, in order to prevent their crossing and blending\\ntogether in utter confusion. the following rules and conclusions are\\nchiefly drawn up from gг¤rtner\\'s admirable work on the hybridisation of\\nplants. i have taken much pains to ascertain how far the rules apply to\\nanimals, and considering how scanty our knowledge is in regard to hybrid\\nanimals, i have been surprised to find how generally the same rules apply\\nto both kingdoms.\\n\\nit has been already remarked, that the degree of fertility, both of first\\ncrosses and of hybrids, graduates from zero to perfect fertility. it is\\nsurprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown to exist;\\nbut only the barest outline of the facts can here be given. when pollen\\nfrom a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a distinct\\nfamily, it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic dust. from this\\nabsolute zero of fertility, the pollen of different species of the same\\ngenus applied to the stigma of some one species, yields a perfect gradation\\nin the number of seeds produced, up to nearly complete or even quite\\ncomplete fertility; and, as we have seen, in certain abnormal cases, even\\nto an excess of fertility, beyond that which the plant\\'s own pollen will\\nproduce. so in hybrids themselves, there are some which never have\\nproduced, and probably never would produce, even {256} with the pollen of\\neither pure parent, a single fertile seed: but in some of these cases a\\nfirst trace of fertility may be detected, by the pollen of one of the pure\\nparent-species causing the flower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it\\notherwise would have done; and the early withering of the flower is well\\nknown to be a sign of incipient fertilisation. from this extreme degree of\\nsterility we have self-fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater\\nnumber of seeds up to perfect fertility.\\n\\nhybrids from two species which are very difficult to cross, and which\\nrarely produce any offspring, are generally very sterile; but the\\nparallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross, and the\\nsterility of the hybrids thus produced--two classes of facts which are\\ngenerally confounded together--is by no means strict. there are many cases,\\nin which two pure species can be united with unusual facility, and produce\\nnumerous hybrid-offspring, yet these hybrids are remarkably sterile. on the\\nother hand, there are species which can be crossed very rarely, or with\\nextreme difficulty, but the hybrids, when at last produced, are very\\nfertile. even within the limits of the same genus, for instance in\\ndianthus, these two opposite cases occur.\\n\\nthe fertility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is more easily\\naffected by unfavourable conditions, than is the fertility of pure species.\\nbut the degree of fertility is likewise innately variable; for it is not\\nalways the same when the same two species are crossed under the same\\ncircumstances, but depends in part upon the constitution of the individuals\\nwhich happen to have been chosen for the experiment. so it is with hybrids,\\nfor their degree of fertility is often found to differ greatly in the\\nseveral individuals raised from seed out of the same capsule and exposed to\\nexactly the same conditions. {257}\\n\\nby the term systematic affinity is meant, the resemblance between species\\nin structure and in constitution, more especially in the structure of parts\\nwhich are of high physiological importance and which differ little in the\\nallied species. now the fertility of first crosses between species, and of\\nthe hybrids produced from them, is largely governed by their systematic\\naffinity. this is clearly shown by hybrids never having been raised between\\nspecies ranked by systematists in distinct families; and on the other hand,\\nby very closely allied species generally uniting with facility. but the\\ncorrespondence between systematic affinity and the facility of crossing is\\nby no means strict. a multitude of cases could be given of very closely\\nallied species which will not unite, or only with extreme difficulty; and\\non the other hand of very distinct species which unite with the utmost\\nfacility. in the same family there may be a genus, as dianthus, in which\\nvery many species can most readily be crossed; and another genus, as\\nsilene, in which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce\\nbetween extremely close species a single hybrid. even within the limits of\\nthe same genus, we meet with this same difference; for instance, the many\\nspecies of nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of\\nalmost any other genus; but gг¤rtner found that n. acuminata, which is not a\\nparticularly distinct species, obstinately failed to fertilise, or to be\\nfertilised by, no less than eight other species of nicotiana. very many\\nanalogous facts could be given.\\n\\nno one has been able to point out what kind, or what amount, of difference\\nin any recognisable character is sufficient to prevent two species\\ncrossing. it can be shown that plants most widely different in habit and\\ngeneral appearance, and having strongly marked {258} differences in every\\npart of the flower, even in the pollen, in the fruit, and in the\\ncotyledons, can be crossed. annual and perennial plants, deciduous and\\nevergreen trees, plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for\\nextremely different climates, can often be crossed with ease.\\n\\nby a reciprocal cross between two species, i mean the case, for instance,\\nof a stallion-horse being first crossed with a female-ass, and then a\\nmale-ass with a mare: these two species may then be said to have been\\nreciprocally crossed. there is often the widest possible difference in the\\nfacility of making reciprocal crosses. such cases are highly important, for\\nthey prove that the capacity in any two species to cross is often\\ncompletely independent of their systematic affinity, or of any recognisable\\ndifference in their whole organisation. on the other hand, these cases\\nclearly show that the capacity for crossing is connected with\\nconstitutional differences imperceptible by us, and confined to the\\nreproductive system. this difference in the result of reciprocal crosses\\nbetween the same two species was long ago observed by kг¶lreuter. to give an\\ninstance: mirabilis jalapa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of m.\\nlongiflora, and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile; but\\nkг¶lreuter tried more than two hundred times, during eight following years,\\nto fertilise reciprocally m. longiflora with the pollen of m. jalapa, and\\nutterly failed. several other equally striking cases could be given. thuret\\nhas observed the same fact with certain sea-weeds or fuci. gг¤rtner,\\nmoreover, found that this difference of facility in making reciprocal\\ncrosses is extremely common in a lesser degree. he has observed it even\\nbetween forms so closely related (as matthiola annua and glabra) that many\\nbotanists rank them only as varieties. it is also a remarkable fact, that\\nhybrids raised from reciprocal crosses, though {259} of course compounded\\nof the very same two species, the one species having first been used as the\\nfather and then as the mother, generally differ in fertility in a small,\\nand occasionally in a high degree.\\n\\nseveral other singular rules could be given from gг¤rtner: for instance,\\nsome species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species; other\\nspecies of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing their\\nlikeness on their hybrid offspring; but these two powers do not at all\\nnecessarily go together. there are certain hybrids which instead of having,\\nas is usual, an intermediate character between their two parents, always\\nclosely resemble one of them; and such hybrids, though externally so like\\none of their pure parent-species, are with rare exceptions extremely\\nsterile. so again amongst hybrids which are usually intermediate in\\nstructure between their parents, exceptional and abnormal individuals\\nsometimes are born, which closely resemble one of their pure parents; and\\nthese hybrids are almost always utterly sterile, even when the other\\nhybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have a considerable degree\\nof fertility. these facts show how completely fertility in the hybrid is\\nindependent of its external resemblance to either pure parent.\\n\\nconsidering the several rules now given, which govern the fertility of\\nfirst crosses and of hybrids, we see that when forms, which must be\\nconsidered as good and distinct species, are united, their fertility\\ngraduates from zero to perfect fertility, or even to fertility under\\ncertain conditions in excess. that their fertility, besides being eminently\\nsusceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions, is innately\\nvariable. that it is by no means always the same in degree in the first\\ncross and in the hybrids produced {260} from this cross. that the fertility\\nof hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble in external\\nappearance either parent. and lastly, that the facility of making a first\\ncross between any two species is not always governed by their systematic\\naffinity or degree of resemblance to each other. this latter statement is\\nclearly proved by reciprocal crosses between the same two species, for\\naccording as the one species or the other is used as the father or the\\nmother, there is generally some difference, and occasionally the widest\\npossible difference, in the facility of effecting an union. the hybrids,\\nmoreover, produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility.\\n\\nnow do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been\\nendowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded in\\nnature? i think not. for why should the sterility be so extremely different\\nin degree, when various species are crossed, all of which we must suppose\\nit would be equally important to keep from blending together? why should\\nthe degree of sterility be innately variable in the individuals of the same\\nspecies? why should some species cross with facility, and yet produce very\\nsterile hybrids; and other species cross with extreme difficulty, and yet\\nproduce fairly fertile hybrids? why should there often be so great a\\ndifference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two\\nspecies? why, it may even be asked, has the production of hybrids been\\npermitted? to grant to species the special power of producing hybrids, and\\nthen to stop their further propagation by different degrees of sterility,\\nnot strictly related to the facility of the first union between their\\nparents, seems to be a strange arrangement.\\n\\nthe foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, {261} appear to me\\nclearly to indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of hybrids\\nis simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences, chiefly in the\\nreproductive systems, of the species which are crossed. the differences\\nbeing of so peculiar and limited a nature, that, in reciprocal crosses\\nbetween two species the male sexual element of the one will often freely\\nact on the female sexual element of the other, but not in a reversed\\ndirection. it will be advisable to explain a little more fully by an\\nexample what i mean by sterility being incidental on other differences, and\\nnot a specially endowed quality. as the capacity of one plant to be grafted\\nor budded on another is so entirely unimportant for its welfare in a state\\nof nature, i presume that no one will suppose that this capacity is a\\n_specially_ endowed quality, but will admit that it is incidental on\\ndifferences in the laws of growth of the two plants. we can sometimes see\\nthe reason why one tree will not take on another, from differences in their\\nrate of growth, in the hardness of their wood, in the period of the flow or\\nnature of their sap, &c.; but in a multitude of cases we can assign no\\nreason whatever. great diversity in the size of two plants, one being woody\\nand the other herbaceous, one being evergreen and the other deciduous, and\\nadaptation to widely different climates, does not always prevent the two\\ngrafting together. as in hybridisation, so with grafting, the capacity is\\nlimited by systematic affinity, for no one has been able to graft trees\\ntogether belonging to quite distinct families; and, on the other hand,\\nclosely allied species, and varieties of the same species, can usually, but\\nnot invariably, be grafted with ease. but this capacity, as in\\nhybridisation, is by no means absolutely governed by systematic affinity.\\nalthough many distinct genera within the same family have been grafted\\n{262} together, in other cases species of the same genus will not take on\\neach other. the pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince, which\\nis ranked as a distinct genus, than on the apple, which is a member of the\\nsame genus. even different varieties of the pear take with different\\ndegrees of facility on the quince; so do different varieties of the apricot\\nand peach on certain varieties of the plum.\\n\\nas gг¤rtner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in different\\n_individuals_ of the same two species in crossing; so sagaret believes this\\nto be the case with different individuals of the same two species in being\\ngrafted together. as in reciprocal crosses, the facility of effecting an\\nunion is often very far from equal, so it sometimes is in grafting; the\\ncommon gooseberry, for instance, cannot be grafted on the currant, whereas\\nthe currant will take, though with difficulty, on the gooseberry.\\n\\nwe have seen that the sterility of hybrids, which have their reproductive\\norgans in an imperfect condition, is a very different case from the\\ndifficulty of uniting two pure species, which have their reproductive\\norgans perfect; yet these two distinct cases run to a certain extent\\nparallel. something analogous occurs in grafting; for thouin found that\\nthree species of robinia, which seeded freely on their own roots, and which\\ncould be grafted with no great difficulty on another species, when thus\\ngrafted were rendered barren. on the other hand, certain species of sorbus,\\nwhen grafted on other species, yielded twice as much fruit as when on their\\nown roots. we are reminded by this latter fact of the extraordinary case of\\nhippeastrum, lobelia, &c, which seeded much more freely when fertilised\\nwith the pollen of distinct species, than when self-fertilised with their\\nown pollen. {263}\\n\\nwe thus see, that although there is a clear and fundamental difference\\nbetween the mere adhesion of grafted stocks, and the union of the male and\\nfemale elements in the act of reproduction, yet that there is a rude degree\\nof parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing distinct species.\\nand as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the facility\\nwith which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on unknown\\ndifferences in their vegetative systems, so i believe that the still more\\ncomplex laws governing the facility of first crosses, are incidental on\\nunknown differences, chiefly in their reproductive systems. these\\ndifferences, in both cases, follow to a certain extent, as might have been\\nexpected, systematic affinity, by which every kind of resemblance and\\ndissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be expressed. the\\nfacts by no means seem to me to indicate that the greater or lesser\\ndifficulty of either grafting or crossing together various species has been\\na special endowment; although in the case of crossing, the difficulty is as\\nimportant for the endurance and stability of specific forms, as in the case\\nof grafting it is unimportant for their welfare.\\n\\n\\n\\n_causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids._--we may now look\\na little closer at the probable causes of the sterility of first crosses\\nand of hybrids. these two cases are fundamentally different, for, as just\\nremarked, in the union of two pure species the male and female sexual\\nelements are perfect, whereas in hybrids they are imperfect. even in first\\ncrosses, the greater or lesser difficulty in effecting a union apparently\\ndepends on several distinct causes. there must sometimes be a physical\\nimpossibility in the male element reaching the ovule, as would be the case\\nwith a plant {264} having a pistil too long for the pollen-tubes to reach\\nthe ovarium. it has also been observed that when pollen of one species is\\nplaced on the stigma of a distantly allied species, though the pollen-tubes\\nprotrude, they do not penetrate the stigmatic surface. again, the male\\nelement may reach the female element, but be incapable of causing an embryo\\nto be developed, as seems to have been the case with some of thuret\\'s\\nexperiments on fuci. no explanation can be given of these facts, any more\\nthan why certain trees cannot be grafted on others. lastly, an embryo may\\nbe developed, and then perish at an early period. this latter alternative\\nhas not been sufficiently attended to; but i believe, from observations\\ncommunicated to me by mr. hewitt, who has had great experience in\\nhybridising gallinaceous birds, that the early death of the embryo is a\\nvery frequent cause of sterility in first crosses. i was at first very\\nunwilling to believe in this view; as hybrids, when once born, are\\ngenerally healthy and long-lived, as we see in the case of the common mule.\\nhybrids, however, are differently circumstanced before and after birth:\\nwhen born and living in a country where their two parents can live, they\\nare generally placed under suitable conditions of life. but a hybrid\\npartakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its mother, and\\ntherefore before birth, as long as it is nourished within its mother\\'s womb\\nor within the egg or seed produced by the mother, it may be exposed to\\nconditions in some degree unsuitable, and consequently be liable to perish\\nat an early period; more especially as all very young beings seem eminently\\nsensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life.\\n\\nin regard to the sterility of hybrids, in which the sexual elements are\\nimperfectly developed, the case is {265} very different. i have more than\\nonce alluded to a large body of facts, which i have collected, showing that\\nwhen animals and plants are removed from their natural conditions, they are\\nextremely liable to have their reproductive systems seriously affected.\\nthis, in fact, is the great bar to the domestication of animals. between\\nthe sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids, there are many points\\nof similarity. in both cases the sterility is independent of general\\nhealth, and is often accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance. in\\nboth cases, the sterility occurs in various degrees; in both, the male\\nelement is the most liable to be affected; but sometimes the female more\\nthan the male. in both, the tendency goes to a certain extent with\\nsystematic affinity, for whole groups of animals and plants are rendered\\nimpotent by the same unnatural conditions; and whole groups of species tend\\nto produce sterile hybrids. on the other hand, one species in a group will\\nsometimes resist great changes of conditions with unimpaired fertility; and\\ncertain species in a group will produce unusually fertile hybrids. no one\\ncan tell, till he tries, whether any particular animal will breed under\\nconfinement or any exotic plant seed freely under culture; nor can he tell,\\ntill he tries, whether any two species of a genus will produce more or less\\nsterile hybrids. lastly, when organic beings are placed during several\\ngenerations under conditions not natural to them, they are extremely liable\\nto vary, which is due, as i believe, to their reproductive systems having\\nbeen specially affected, though in a lesser degree than when sterility\\nensues. so it is with hybrids, for hybrids in successive generations are\\neminently liable to vary, as every experimentalist has observed.\\n\\nthus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural\\nconditions, and when hybrids {266} are produced by the unnatural crossing\\nof two species, the reproductive system, independently of the general state\\nof health, is affected by sterility in a very similar manner. in the one\\ncase, the conditions of life have been disturbed, though often in so slight\\na degree as to be inappreciable by us; in the other case, or that of\\nhybrids, the external conditions have remained the same, but the\\norganisation has been disturbed by two different structures and\\nconstitutions having been blended into one. for it is scarcely possible\\nthat two organisations should be compounded into one, without some\\ndisturbance occurring in the development, or periodical action, or mutual\\nrelation of the different parts and organs one to another, or to the\\nconditions of life. when hybrids are able to breed _inter se_, they\\ntransmit to their offspring from generation to generation the same\\ncompounded organisation, and hence we need not be surprised that their\\nsterility, though in some degree variable, rarely diminishes.\\n\\nit must, however, be confessed that we cannot understand, excepting on\\nvague hypotheses, several facts with respect to the sterility of hybrids;\\nfor instance, the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal\\ncrosses; or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally and\\nexceptionally resemble closely either pure parent. nor do i pretend that\\nthe foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter: no explanation is\\noffered why an organism, when placed under unnatural conditions, is\\nrendered sterile. all that i have attempted to show, is that in two cases,\\nin some respects allied, sterility is the common result,--in the one case\\nfrom the conditions of life having been disturbed, in the other case from\\nthe organisation having been disturbed by two organisations having been\\ncompounded into one.\\n\\nit may seem fanciful, but i suspect that a similar {267} parallelism\\nextends to an allied yet very different class of facts. it is an old and\\nalmost universal belief, founded, i think, on a considerable body of\\nevidence, that slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to\\nall living things. we see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their\\nfrequent exchanges of seed, tubers, &c., from one soil or climate to\\nanother, and back again. during the convalescence of animals, we plainly\\nsee that great benefit is derived from almost any change in the habits of\\nlife. again, both with plants and animals, there is abundant evidence, that\\na cross between very distinct individuals of the same species, that is\\nbetween members of different strains or sub-breeds, gives vigour and\\nfertility to the offspring. i believe, indeed, from the facts alluded to in\\nour fourth chapter, that a certain amount of crossing is indispensable even\\nwith hermaphrodites; and that close interbreeding continued during several\\ngenerations between the nearest relations, especially if these be kept\\nunder the same conditions of life, always induces weakness and sterility in\\nthe progeny.\\n\\nhence it seems that, on the one hand, slight changes in the conditions of\\nlife benefit all organic beings, and on the other hand, that slight\\ncrosses, that is crosses between the males and females of the same species\\nwhich have varied and become slightly different, give vigour and fertility\\nto the offspring. but we have seen that greater changes, or changes of a\\nparticular nature, often render organic beings in some degree sterile; and\\nthat greater crosses, that is crosses between males and females which have\\nbecome widely or specifically different, produce hybrids which are\\ngenerally sterile in some degree. i cannot persuade myself that this\\nparallelism is an accident or an illusion. both series of facts seem to be\\nconnected together by some {268} common but unknown bond, which is\\nessentially related to the principle of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n_fertility of varieties when crossed, and of their mongrel offspring._--it\\nmay be urged, as a most forcible argument, that there must be some\\nessential distinction between species and varieties, and that there must be\\nsome error in all the foregoing remarks, inasmuch as varieties, however\\nmuch they may differ from each other in external appearance, cross with\\nperfect facility, and yield perfectly fertile offspring. i fully admit that\\nthis is almost invariably the case. but if we look to varieties produced\\nunder nature, we are immediately involved in hopeless difficulties; for if\\ntwo hitherto reputed varieties be found in any degree sterile together,\\nthey are at once ranked by most naturalists as species. for instance, the\\nblue and red pimpernel, the primrose and cowslip, which are considered by\\nmany of our best botanists as varieties, are said by gг¤rtner not to be\\nquite fertile when crossed, and he consequently ranks them as undoubted\\nspecies. if we thus argue in a circle, the fertility of all varieties\\nproduced under nature will assuredly have to be granted.\\n\\nif we turn to varieties, produced, or supposed to have been produced, under\\ndomestication, we are still involved in doubt. for when it is stated, for\\ninstance, that the german spitz dog unites more easily than other dogs with\\nfoxes, or that certain south american indigenous domestic dogs do not\\nreadily cross with european dogs, the explanation which will occur to every\\none, and probably the true one, is that these dogs have descended from\\nseveral aboriginally distinct species. nevertheless the perfect fertility\\nof so many domestic varieties, differing widely from each other in\\nappearance, for instance of the pigeon or of the cabbage, is {269} a\\nremarkable fact; more especially when we reflect how many species there\\nare, which, though resembling each other most closely, are utterly sterile\\nwhen intercrossed. several considerations, however, render the fertility of\\ndomestic varieties less remarkable than at first appears. it can, in the\\nfirst place, be clearly shown that mere external dissimilarity between two\\nspecies does not determine their greater or lesser degree of sterility when\\ncrossed; and we may apply the same rule to domestic varieties. in the\\nsecond place, some eminent naturalists believe that a long course of\\ndomestication tends to eliminate sterility in the successive generations of\\nhybrids which were at first only slightly sterile; and if this be so, we\\nsurely ought not to expect to find sterility both appearing and\\ndisappearing under nearly the same conditions of life. lastly, and this\\nseems to me by far the most important consideration, new races of animals\\nand plants are produced under domestication by man\\'s methodical and\\nunconscious power of selection, for his own use and pleasure: he neither\\nwishes to select, nor could select, slight differences in the reproductive\\nsystem, or other constitutional differences correlated with the\\nreproductive system. he supplies his several varieties with the same food;\\ntreats them in nearly the same manner, and does not wish to alter their\\ngeneral habits of life. nature acts uniformly and slowly during vast\\nperiods of time on the whole organisation, in any way which may be for each\\ncreature\\'s own good; and thus she may, either directly, or more probably\\nindirectly, through correlation, modify the reproductive system in the\\nseveral descendants from any one species. seeing this difference in the\\nprocess of selection, as carried on by man and nature, we need not be\\nsurprised at some difference in the result.\\n\\ni have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same {270} species were\\ninvariably fertile when intercrossed. but it seems to me impossible to\\nresist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in\\nthe few following cases, which i will briefly abstract. the evidence is at\\nleast as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a multitude\\nof species. the evidence is, also, derived from hostile witnesses, who in\\nall other cases consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of\\nspecific distinction. gг¤rtner kept during several years a dwarf kind of\\nmaize with yellow seeds, and a tall variety with red seeds, growing near\\neach other in his garden; and although these plants have separated sexes,\\nthey never naturally crossed. he then fertilised thirteen flowers of the\\none with the pollen of the other; but only a single head produced any seed,\\nand this one head produced only five grains. manipulation in this case\\ncould not have been injurious, as the plants have separated sexes. no one,\\ni believe, has suspected that these varieties of maize are distinct\\nspecies; and it is important to notice that the hybrid plants thus raised\\nwere themselves _perfectly_ fertile; so that even gг¤rtner did not venture\\nto consider the two varieties as specifically distinct.\\n\\ngirou de buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd, which like the\\nmaize has separated sexes, and he asserts that their mutual fertilisation\\nis by so much the less easy as their differences are greater. how far these\\nexperiments may be trusted, i know not; but the forms experimentised on,\\nare ranked by sagaret, who mainly founds his classification by the test of\\ninfertility, as varieties.\\n\\nthe following case is far more remarkable, and seems at first quite\\nincredible; but it is the result of an astonishing number of experiments\\nmade during many years on nine species of verbascum, by so good an observer\\n{271} and so hostile a witness, as gг¤rtner: namely, that yellow and white\\nvarieties of the same species of verbascum when intercrossed produce less\\nseed, than do either coloured varieties when fertilised with pollen from\\ntheir own coloured flowers. moreover, he asserts that when yellow and white\\nvarieties of one species are crossed with yellow and white varieties of a\\n_distinct_ species, more seed is produced by the crosses between the\\nsimilarly coloured flowers, than between those which are differently\\ncoloured. yet these varieties of verbascum present no other difference\\nbesides the mere colour of the flower; and one variety can sometimes be\\nraised from the seed of the other.\\n\\nfrom observations which i have made on certain varieties of hollyhock, i am\\ninclined to suspect that they present analogous facts.\\n\\nkг¶lreuter, whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent observer,\\nhas proved the remarkable fact, that one variety of the common tobacco is\\nmore fertile, when crossed with a widely distinct species, than are the\\nother varieties. he experimentised on five forms, which are commonly\\nreputed to be varieties, and which he tested by the severest trial, namely,\\nby reciprocal crosses, and he found their mongrel offspring perfectly\\nfertile. but one of these five varieties, when used either as father or\\nmother, and crossed with the nicotiana glutinosa, always yielded hybrids\\nnot so sterile as those which were produced from the four other varieties\\nwhen crossed with n. glutinosa. hence the reproductive system of this one\\nvariety must have been in some manner and in some degree modified.\\n\\nfrom these facts; from the great difficulty of ascertaining the infertility\\nof varieties in a state of nature, for a supposed variety if infertile in\\nany degree would generally be ranked as species; from man selecting only\\n{272} external characters in the production of the most distinct domestic\\nvarieties, and from not wishing or being able to produce recondite and\\nfunctional differences in the reproductive system; from these several\\nconsiderations and facts, i do not think that the very general fertility of\\nvarieties can be proved to be of universal occurrence, or to form a\\nfundamental distinction between varieties and species. the general\\nfertility of varieties does not seem to me sufficient to overthrow the view\\nwhich i have taken with respect to the very general, but not invariable,\\nsterility of first crosses and of hybrids, namely, that it is not a special\\nendowment, but is incidental on slowly acquired modifications, more\\nespecially in the reproductive systems of the forms which are crossed.\\n\\n\\n\\n_hybrids and mongrels compared, independently of their\\nfertility._--independently of the question of fertility, the offspring of\\nspecies when crossed and of varieties when crossed may be compared in\\nseveral other respects. gг¤rtner, whose strong wish was to draw a marked\\nline of distinction between species and varieties, could find very few and,\\nas it seems to me, quite unimportant differences between the so-called\\nhybrid offspring of species, and the so-called mongrel offspring of\\nvarieties. and, on the other hand, they agree most closely in very many\\nimportant respects.\\n\\ni shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity. the most important\\ndistinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are more variable\\nthan hybrids; but gг¤rtner admits that hybrids from species which have long\\nbeen cultivated are often variable in the first generation; and i have\\nmyself seen striking instances of this fact. gг¤rtner further admits that\\nhybrids between very closely allied species are more variable {273} than\\nthose from very distinct species; and this shows that the difference in the\\ndegree of variability graduates away. when mongrels and the more fertile\\nhybrids are propagated for several generations an extreme amount of\\nvariability in their offspring is notorious; but some few cases both of\\nhybrids and mongrels long retaining uniformity of character could be given.\\nthe variability, however, in the successive generations of mongrels is,\\nperhaps, greater than in hybrids.\\n\\nthis greater variability of mongrels than of hybrids does not seem to me at\\nall surprising. for the parents of mongrels are varieties, and mostly\\ndomestic varieties (very few experiments having been tried on natural\\nvarieties), and this implies in most cases that there has been recent\\nvariability; and therefore we might expect that such variability would\\noften continue and be superadded to that arising from the mere act of\\ncrossing. the slight degree of variability in hybrids from the first cross\\nor in the first generation, in contrast with their extreme variability in\\nthe succeeding generations, is a curious fact and deserves attention. for\\nit bears on and corroborates the view which i have taken on the cause of\\nordinary variability; namely, that it is due to the reproductive system\\nbeing eminently sensitive to any change in the conditions of life, being\\nthus often rendered either impotent or at least incapable of its proper\\nfunction of producing offspring identical with the parent-form. now hybrids\\nin the first generation are descended from species (excluding those long\\ncultivated) which have not had their reproductive systems in any way\\naffected, and they are not variable; but hybrids themselves have their\\nreproductive systems seriously affected, and their descendants are highly\\nvariable.\\n\\nbut to return to our comparison of mongrels and {274} hybrids: gг¤rtner\\nstates that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either\\nparent-form; but this, if it be true, is certainly only a difference in\\ndegree. gг¤rtner further insists that when any two species, although most\\nclosely allied to each other, are crossed with a third species, the hybrids\\nare widely different from each other; whereas if two very distinct\\nvarieties of one species are crossed with another species, the hybrids do\\nnot differ much. but this conclusion, as far as i can make out, is founded\\non a single experiment; and seems directly opposed to the results of\\nseveral experiments made by kг¶lreuter.\\n\\nthese alone are the unimportant differences, which gг¤rtner is able to point\\nout, between hybrid and mongrel plants. on the other hand, the resemblance\\nin mongrels and in hybrids to their respective parents, more especially in\\nhybrids produced from nearly related species, follows according to gг¤rtner\\nthe same laws. when two species are crossed, one has sometimes a prepotent\\npower of impressing its likeness on the hybrid; and so i believe it to be\\nwith varieties of plants. with animals one variety certainly often has this\\nprepotent power over another variety. hybrid plants produced from a\\nreciprocal cross, generally resemble each other closely; and so it is with\\nmongrels from a reciprocal cross. both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced\\nto either pure parent-form, by repeated crosses in successive generations\\nwith either parent.\\n\\nthese several remarks are apparently applicable to animals; but the subject\\nis here excessively complicated, partly owing to the existence of secondary\\nsexual characters; but more especially owing to prepotency in transmitting\\nlikeness running more strongly in one sex than in the other, both when one\\nspecies is crossed with another, and when, one variety is crossed with\\n{275} another variety. for instance, i think those authors are right, who\\nmaintain that the ass has a prepotent power over the horse, so that both\\nthe mule and the hinny more resemble the ass than the horse; but that the\\nprepotency runs more strongly in the male-ass than in the female, so that\\nthe mule, which is the offspring of the male-ass and mare, is more like an\\nass, than is the hinny, which is the offspring of the female-ass and\\nstallion.\\n\\nmuch stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact, that\\nmongrel animals alone are born closely like one of their parents; but it\\ncan be shown that this does sometimes occur with hybrids; yet i grant much\\nless frequently with hybrids than with mongrels. looking to the cases which\\ni have collected of cross-bred animals closely resembling one parent, the\\nresemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almost monstrous in their\\nnature, and which have suddenly appeared--such as albinism, melanism,\\ndeficiency of tail or horns, or additional fingers and toes; and do not\\nrelate to characters which have been slowly acquired by selection.\\nconsequently, sudden reversions to the perfect character of either parent\\nwould be more likely to occur with mongrels, which are descended from\\nvarieties often suddenly produced and semi-monstrous in character, than\\nwith hybrids, which are descended from species slowly and naturally\\nproduced. on the whole i entirely agree with dr. prosper lucas, who, after\\narranging an enormous body of facts with respect to animals, comes to the\\nconclusion, that the laws of resemblance of the child to its parents are\\nthe same, whether the two parents differ much or little from each other,\\nnamely in the union of individuals of the same variety, or of different\\nvarieties, or of distinct species.\\n\\nlaying aside the question of fertility and sterility, {276} in all other\\nrespects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the offspring\\nof crossed species, and of crossed varieties. if we look at species as\\nhaving been specially created, and at varieties as having been produced by\\nsecondary laws, this similarity would be an astonishing fact. but it\\nharmonises perfectly with the view that there is no essential distinction\\nbetween species and varieties.\\n\\n\\n\\n_summary of chapter._--first crosses between forms sufficiently distinct to\\nbe ranked as species, and their hybrids, are very generally, but not\\nuniversally, sterile. the sterility is of all degrees, and is often so\\nslight that the two most careful experimentalists who have ever lived, have\\ncome to diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test.\\nthe sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species, and\\nis eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions. the\\ndegree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity, but is\\ngoverned by several curious and complex laws. it is generally different,\\nand sometimes widely different, in reciprocal crosses between the same two\\nspecies. it is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in the\\nhybrid produced from this cross.\\n\\nin the same manner as in grafting trees, the capacity of one species or\\nvariety to take on another, is incidental on generally unknown differences\\nin their vegetative systems, so in crossing, the greater or less facility\\nof one species to unite with another, is incidental on unknown differences\\nin their reproductive systems. there is no more reason to think that\\nspecies have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to\\nprevent them crossing and blending in nature, than to think that trees have\\nbeen specially endowed with various and {277} somewhat analogous degrees of\\ndifficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them becoming\\ninarched in our forests.\\n\\nthe sterility of first crosses between pure species, which have their\\nreproductive systems perfect, seems to depend on several circumstances; in\\nsome cases largely on the early death of the embryo. the sterility of\\nhybrids, which have their reproductive systems imperfect, and which have\\nhad this system and their whole organisation disturbed by being compounded\\nof two distinct species, seems closely allied to that sterility which so\\nfrequently affects pure species, when their natural conditions of life have\\nbeen disturbed. this view is supported by a parallelism of another\\nkind;--namely, that the crossing of forms only slightly different is\\nfavourable to the vigour and fertility of their offspring; and that slight\\nchanges in the conditions of life are apparently favourable to the vigour\\nand fertility of all organic beings. it is not surprising that the degree\\nof difficulty in uniting two species, and the degree of sterility of their\\nhybrid-offspring should generally correspond, though due to distinct\\ncauses; for both depend on the amount of difference of some kind between\\nthe species which are crossed. nor is it surprising that the facility of\\neffecting a first cross, the fertility of the hybrids produced from it, and\\nthe capacity of being grafted together--though this latter capacity\\nevidently depends on widely different circumstances--should all run, to a\\ncertain extent, parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which\\nare subjected to experiment; for systematic affinity attempts to express\\nall kinds of resemblance between all species.\\n\\nfirst crosses between forms known to be varieties, or sufficiently alike to\\nbe considered as varieties, and their mongrel offspring, are very\\ngenerally, but not quite {278} universally, fertile. nor is this nearly\\ngeneral and perfect fertility surprising, when we remember how liable we\\nare to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature;\\nand when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been\\nproduced under domestication by the selection of mere external differences,\\nand not of differences in the reproductive system. in all other respects,\\nexcluding fertility, there is a close general resemblance between hybrids\\nand mongrels. finally, then, the facts briefly given in this chapter do not\\nseem to me opposed to, but even rather to support the view, that there is\\nno fundamental distinction between species and varieties.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *

varieties; on their number--on the vast\\n    lapse of time, as inferred from the rate of deposition and of\\n    denudation--on the poorness of our palг¦ontological collections--on the\\n    intermittence of geological formations--on the absence of intermediate\\n    varieties in any one formation--on the sudden appearance of groups of\\n    species--on their sudden appearance in the lowest known fossiliferous\\n    strata.\\n\\nin the sixth chapter i enumerated the chief objections which might be\\njustly urged against the views maintained in this volume. most of them have\\nnow been discussed. one, namely the distinctness of specific forms, and\\ntheir not being blended together by innumerable transitional links, is a\\nvery obvious difficulty. i assigned reasons why such links do not commonly\\noccur at the present day, under the circumstances apparently most\\nfavourable for their presence, namely on an extensive and continuous area\\nwith graduated physical conditions. i endeavoured to show, that the life of\\neach species depends in a more important manner on the presence of other\\nalready defined organic forms, than on climate; and, therefore, that the\\nreally governing conditions of life do not graduate away quite insensibly\\nlike heat or moisture. i endeavoured, also, to show that intermediate\\nvarieties, from existing in lesser numbers than the forms which they\\nconnect, will generally be beaten out and exterminated during the course of\\nfurther modification and improvement. the main cause, however, of\\ninnumerable intermediate links not now occurring everywhere throughout\\nnature {280} depends on the very process of natural selection, through\\nwhich new varieties continually take the places of and exterminate their\\nparent-forms. but just in proportion as this process of extermination has\\nacted on an enormous scale, so must the number of intermediate varieties,\\nwhich have formerly existed on the earth, be truly enormous. why then is\\nnot every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate\\nlinks? geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic\\nchain; and this, perhaps, is the most obvious and gravest objection which\\ncan be urged against my theory. the explanation lies, as i believe, in the\\nextreme imperfection of the geological record.\\n\\nin the first place it should always be borne in mind what sort of\\nintermediate forms must, on my theory, have formerly existed. i have found\\nit difficult, when looking at any two species, to avoid picturing to\\nmyself, forms _directly_ intermediate between them. but this is a wholly\\nfalse view; we should always look for forms intermediate between each\\nspecies and a common but unknown progenitor; and the progenitor will\\ngenerally have differed in some respects from all its modified descendants.\\nto give a simple illustration: the fantail and pouter pigeons have both\\ndescended from the rock-pigeon; if we possessed all the intermediate\\nvarieties which have ever existed, we should have an extremely close series\\nbetween both and the rock-pigeon; but we should have no varieties directly\\nintermediate between the fantail and pouter; none, for instance, combining\\na tail somewhat expanded with a crop somewhat enlarged, the characteristic\\nfeatures of these two breeds. these two breeds, moreover, have become so\\nmuch modified, that if we had no historical or indirect evidence regarding\\ntheir origin, it would not have been possible to have {281} determined from\\na mere comparison of their structure with that of the rock-pigeon, whether\\nthey had descended from this species or from some other allied species,\\nsuch as c. oenas.\\n\\nso with natural species, if we look to forms very distinct, for instance to\\nthe horse and tapir, we have no reason to suppose that links ever existed\\ndirectly intermediate between them, but between each and an unknown common\\nparent. the common parent will have had in its whole organisation much\\ngeneral resemblance to the tapir and to the horse; but in some points of\\nstructure may have differed considerably from both, even perhaps more than\\nthey differ from each other. hence in all such cases, we should be unable\\nto recognise the parent-form of any two or more species, even if we closely\\ncompared the structure of the parent with that of its modified descendants,\\nunless at the same time we had a nearly perfect chain of the intermediate\\nlinks.\\n\\nit is just possible by my theory, that one of two living forms might have\\ndescended from the other; for instance, a horse from a tapir; and in this\\ncase _direct_ intermediate links will have existed between them. but such a\\ncase would imply that one form had remained for a very long period\\nunaltered, whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of change;\\nand the principle of competition between organism and organism, between\\nchild and parent, will render this a very rare event; for in all cases the\\nnew and improved forms of life tend to supplant the old and unimproved\\nforms.\\n\\nby the theory of natural selection all living species have been connected\\nwith the parent-species of each genus, by differences not greater than we\\nsee between the varieties of the same species at the present {282} day; and\\nthese parent-species, now generally extinct, have in their turn been\\nsimilarly connected with more ancient species; and so on backwards, always\\nconverging to the common ancestor of each great class. so that the number\\nof intermediate and transitional links, between all living and extinct\\nspecies, must have been inconceivably great. but assuredly, if this theory\\nbe true, such have lived upon this earth.\\n\\n\\n\\n_on the lapse of time._--independently of our not finding fossil remains of\\nsuch infinitely numerous connecting links, it may be objected, that time\\nwill not have sufficed for so great an amount of organic change, all\\nchanges having been effected very slowly through natural selection. it is\\nhardly possible for me even to recall to the reader, who may not be a\\npractical geologist, the facts leading the mind feebly to comprehend the\\nlapse of time. he who can read sir charles lyell\\'s grand work on the\\nprinciples of geology, which the future historian will recognise as having\\nproduced a revolution in natural science, yet does not admit how\\nincomprehensively vast have been the past periods of time, may at once\\nclose this volume. not that it suffices to study the principles of geology,\\nor to read special treatises by different observers on separate formations,\\nand to mark how each author attempts to give an inadequate idea of the\\nduration of each formation or even each stratum. a man must for years\\nexamine for himself great piles of superimposed strata, and watch the sea\\nat work grinding down old rocks and making fresh sediment, before he can\\nhope to comprehend anything of the lapse of time, the monuments of which we\\nsee around us.\\n\\nit is good to wander along lines of sea-coast, when formed of moderately\\nhard rocks, and mark the {283} process of degradation. the tides in most\\ncases reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day, and the waves eat\\ninto them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles; for there is\\ngood evidence that pure water can effect little or nothing in wearing away\\nrock. at last the base of the cliff is undermined, huge fragments fall\\ndown, and these remaining fixed, have to be worn away, atom by atom, until\\nreduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves, and then are more\\nquickly ground into pebbles, sand, or mud. but how often do we see along\\nthe bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders, all thickly clothed by\\nmarine productions, showing how little they are abraded and how seldom they\\nare rolled about! moreover, if we follow for a few miles any line of rocky\\ncliff, which is undergoing degradation, we find that it is only here and\\nthere, along a short length or round a promontory, that the cliffs are at\\nthe present time suffering. the appearance of the surface and the\\nvegetation show that elsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed\\ntheir base.\\n\\nhe who most closely studies the action of the sea on our shores, will, i\\nbelieve, be most deeply impressed with the slowness with which rocky coasts\\nare worn away. the observations on this head by hugh miller, and by that\\nexcellent observer mr. smith of jordan hill, are most impressive. with the\\nmind thus impressed, let any one examine beds of conglomerate many thousand\\nfeet in thickness, which, though probably formed at a quicker rate than\\nmany other deposits, yet, from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles,\\neach of which bears the stamp of time, are good to show how slowly the mass\\nhas been accumulated. in the cordillera i estimated one pile of\\nconglomerate at ten thousand feet in thickness. let the {284} observer\\nremember lyell\\'s profound remark that the thickness and extent of\\nsedimentary formations are the result and measure of the degradation which\\nthe earth\\'s crust has elsewhere suffered. and what an amount of degradation\\nis implied by the sedimentary deposits of many countries! professor ramsay\\nhas given me the maximum thickness, in most cases from actual measurement,\\nin a few cases from estimate, of each formation in different parts of great\\nbritain; and this is the result:--\\n\\n                                                     feet.\\n  palг¦ozoic strata (not including igneous beds)      57,154\\n  secondary strata                                   13,190\\n  tertiary strata                                     2,240\\n\\n--making altogether 72,584 feet; that is, very nearly thirteen and\\nthree-quarters british miles. some of the formations, which are represented\\nin england by thin beds, are thousands of feet in thickness on the\\ncontinent. moreover, between each successive formation, we have, in the\\nopinion of most geologists, enormously long blank periods. so that the\\nlofty pile of sedimentary rocks in britain, gives but an inadequate idea of\\nthe time which has elapsed during their accumulation; yet what time this\\nmust have consumed! good observers have estimated that sediment is\\ndeposited by the great mississippi river at the rate of only 600 feet in a\\nhundred thousand years. this estimate has no pretension to strict\\nexactness; yet, considering over what wide spaces very fine sediment is\\ntransported by the currents of the sea, the process of accumulation in any\\none area must be extremely slow.\\n\\nbut the amount of denudation which the strata have in many places suffered,\\nindependently of the rate of accumulation of the degraded matter, probably\\noffers the best evidence of the lapse of time. i remember {285} having been\\nmuch struck with the evidence of denudation, when viewing volcanic islands,\\nwhich have been worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular\\ncliffs of one or two thousand feet in height; for the gentle slope of the\\nlava-streams, due to their formerly liquid state, showed at a glance how\\nfar the hard, rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean. the same\\nstory is still more plainly told by faults,--those great cracks along which\\nthe strata have been upheaved on one side, or thrown down on the other, to\\nthe height or depth of thousands of feet; for since the crust cracked, the\\nsurface of the land has been so completely planed down by the action of the\\nsea, that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible.\\n\\nthe craven fault, for instance, extends for upwards of 30 miles, and along\\nthis line the vertical displacement of the strata has varied from 600 to\\n3000 feet. prof. ramsay has published an account of a downthrow in anglesea\\nof 2300 feet; and he informs me that he fully believes there is one in\\nmerionethshire of 12,000 feet; yet in these cases there is nothing on the\\nsurface to show such prodigious movements; the pile of rocks on the one or\\nother side having been smoothly swept away. the consideration of these\\nfacts impresses my mind almost in the same manner as does the vain\\nendeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity.\\n\\ni am tempted to give one other case, the well-known one of the denudation\\nof the weald. though it must be admitted that the denudation of the weald\\nhas been a mere trifle, in comparison with that which has removed masses of\\nour palг¦ozoic strata, in parts ten thousand feet in thickness, as shown in\\nprof. ramsay\\'s masterly memoir on this subject: yet it is an admirable\\nlesson to stand on the intermediate hilly country and look on the one hand\\nat the north downs, and {286} on the other hand at the south downs; for,\\nremembering that at no great distance to the west the northern and southern\\nescarpments meet and close, one can safely picture to oneself the great\\ndome of rocks which must have covered up the weald within so limited a\\nperiod as since the latter part of the chalk formation. the distance from\\nthe northern to the southern downs is about 22 miles, and the thickness of\\nthe several formations is on an average about 1100 feet, as i am informed\\nby prof. ramsay. but if, as some geologists suppose, a range of older rocks\\nunderlies the weald, on the flanks of which the overlying sedimentary\\ndeposits might have accumulated in thinner masses than elsewhere, the above\\nestimate would be erroneous; but this source of doubt probably would not\\ngreatly affect the estimate as applied to the western extremity of the\\ndistrict. if, then, we knew the rate at which the sea commonly wears away a\\nline of cliff of any given height, we could measure the time requisite to\\nhave denuded the weald. this, of course cannot be done; but we may, in\\norder to form some crude notion on the subject, assume that the sea would\\neat into cliffs 500 feet in height at the rate of one inch in a century.\\nthis will at first appear much too small an allowance; but it is the same\\nas if we were to assume a cliff one yard in height to be eaten back along a\\nwhole line of coast at the rate of one yard in nearly every twenty-two\\nyears. i doubt whether any rock, even as soft as chalk, would yield at this\\nrate excepting on the most exposed coasts; though no doubt the degradation\\nof a lofty cliff would be more rapid from the breakage of the fallen\\nfragments. on the other hand, i do not believe that any line of coast, ten\\nor twenty miles in length, ever suffers degradation at the same time along\\nits whole indented length; and we {287} must remember that almost all\\nstrata contain harder layers or nodules, which from long resisting\\nattrition form a breakwater at the base. we may at least confidently\\nbelieve that no rocky coast 500 feet in height commonly yields at the rate\\nof a foot per century; for this would be the same in amount as a cliff one\\nyard in height retreating twelve yards in twenty-two years; and no one, i\\nthink, who has carefully observed the shape of old fallen fragments at the\\nbase of cliffs, will admit any near approach to such rapid wearing away.\\nhence, under ordinary circumstances, i should infer that for a cliff 500\\nfeet in height, a denudation of one inch per century for the whole length\\nwould be a sufficient allowance. at this rate, on the above data, the\\ndenudation of the weald must have required 306,662,400 years; or say three\\nhundred million years. but perhaps it would be safer to allow two or three\\ninches per century, and this would reduce the number of years to one\\nhundred and fifty or one hundred million years.\\n\\nthe action of fresh water on the gently inclined wealden district, when\\nupraised, could hardly have been great, but it would somewhat reduce the\\nabove estimate. on the other hand, during oscillations of level, which we\\nknow this area has undergone, the surface may have existed for millions of\\nyears as land, and thus have escaped the action of the sea: when deeply\\nsubmerged for perhaps equally long periods, it would, likewise, have\\nescaped the action of the coast-waves. so that it is not improbable that a\\nlonger period than 300 million years has elapsed since the latter part of\\nthe secondary period.\\n\\ni have made these few remarks because it is highly important for us to gain\\nsome notion, however imperfect, of the lapse of years. during each of these\\nyears, {288} over the whole world, the land and the water has been peopled\\nby hosts of living forms. what an infinite number of generations, which the\\nmind cannot grasp, must have succeeded each other in the long roll of\\nyears! now turn to our richest geological museums, and what a paltry\\ndisplay we behold!\\n\\n\\n\\n_on the poorness of our palг¦ontological collections._--that our\\npalг¦ontological collections are very imperfect, is admitted by every one.\\nthe remark of that admirable palг¦ontologist, the late edward forbes, should\\nnot be forgotten, namely, that numbers of our fossil species are known and\\nnamed from single and often broken specimens, or from a few specimens\\ncollected on some one spot. only a small portion of the surface of the\\nearth has been geologically explored, and no part with sufficient care, as\\nthe important discoveries made every year in europe prove. no organism\\nwholly soft can be preserved. shells and bones will decay and disappear\\nwhen left on the bottom of the sea, where sediment is not accumulating. i\\nbelieve we are continually taking a most erroneous view, when we tacitly\\nadmit to ourselves that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole\\nbed of the sea, at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil\\nremains. throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean, the bright\\nblue tint of the water bespeaks its purity. the many cases on record of a\\nformation conformably covered, after an enormous interval of time, by\\nanother and later formation, without the underlying bed having suffered in\\nthe interval any wear and tear, seem explicable only on the view of the\\nbottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition. the\\nremains which do become embedded, if in sand or gravel, will when the beds\\nare upraised generally be dissolved {289} by the percolation of rain-water.\\ni suspect that but few of the very many animals which live on the beach\\nbetween high and low watermark are preserved. for instance, the several\\nspecies of the chthamalinг¦ (a subfamily of sessile cirripedes) coat the\\nrocks all over the world in infinite numbers: they are all strictly\\nlittoral, with the exception of a single mediterranean species, which\\ninhabits deep water and has been found fossil in sicily, whereas not one\\nother species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation: yet it is\\nnow known that the genus chthamalus existed during the chalk period. the\\nmolluscan genus chiton offers a partially analogous case.\\n\\nwith respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the\\nsecondary and palг¦ozoic periods, it is superfluous to state that our\\nevidence from fossil remains is fragmentary in an extreme degree. for\\ninstance, not a land shell is known belonging to either of these vast\\nperiods, with the exception of one species discovered by sir c. lyell and\\ndr. dawson in the carboniferous strata of north america, of which shell\\nseveral specimens have now been collected. in regard to mammiferous\\nremains, a single glance at the historical table published in the\\nsupplement to lyell\\'s manual, will bring home the truth, how accidental and\\nrare is their preservation, far better than pages of detail. nor is their\\nrarity surprising, when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of\\ntertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine\\ndeposits; and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging to\\nthe age of our secondary or palг¦ozoic formations.\\n\\nbut the imperfection in the geological record mainly results from another\\nand more important cause than any of the foregoing; namely, from the\\nseveral formations {290} being separated from each other by wide intervals\\nof time. when we see the formations tabulated in written works, or when we\\nfollow them in nature, it is difficult to avoid believing that they are\\nclosely consecutive. but we know, for instance, from sir r. murchison\\'s\\ngreat work on russia, what wide gaps there are in that country between the\\nsuperimposed formations; so it is in north america, and in many other parts\\nof the world. the most skilful geologist, if his attention had been\\nexclusively confined to these large territories, would never have suspected\\nthat during the periods which were blank and barren in his own country,\\ngreat piles of sediment, charged with new and peculiar forms of life, had\\nelsewhere been accumulated. and if in each separate territory, hardly any\\nidea can be formed of the length of time which has elapsed between the\\nconsecutive formations, we may infer that this could nowhere be\\nascertained. the frequent and great changes in the mineralogical\\ncomposition of consecutive formations, generally implying great changes in\\nthe geography of the surrounding lands, whence the sediment has been\\nderived, accords with the belief of vast intervals of time having elapsed\\nbetween each formation.\\n\\nbut we can, i think, see why the geological formations of each region are\\nalmost invariably intermittent; that is, have not followed each other in\\nclose sequence. scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many\\nhundred miles of the south american coasts, which have been upraised\\nseveral hundred feet within the recent period, than the absence of any\\nrecent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short geological\\nperiod. along the whole west coast, which is inhabited by a peculiar marine\\nfauna, tertiary beds are so poorly developed, that no record of several\\n{291} successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be preserved to a\\ndistant age. a little reflection will explain why along the rising coast of\\nthe western side of south america, no extensive formations with recent or\\ntertiary remains can anywhere be found, though the supply of sediment must\\nfor ages have been great, from the enormous degradation of the coast-rocks\\nand from muddy streams entering the sea. the explanation, no doubt, is,\\nthat the littoral and sub-littoral deposits are continually worn away, as\\nsoon as they are brought up by the slow and gradual rising of the land\\nwithin the grinding action of the coast-waves.\\n\\nwe may, i think, safely conclude that sediment must be accumulated in\\nextremely thick, solid, or extensive masses, in order to withstand the\\nincessant action of the waves, when first upraised and during subsequent\\noscillations of level. such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment\\nmay be formed in two ways; either, in profound depths of the sea, in which\\ncase, judging from the researches of e. forbes, we may conclude that the\\nbottom will be inhabited by extremely few animals, and the mass when\\nupraised will give a most imperfect record of the forms of life which then\\nexisted; or, sediment may be accumulated to any thickness and extent over a\\nshallow bottom, if it continue slowly to subside. in this latter case, as\\nlong as the rate of subsidence and supply of sediment nearly balance each\\nother, the sea will remain shallow and favourable for life, and thus a\\nfossiliferous formation thick enough, when upraised, to resist any amount\\nof degradation, may be formed.\\n\\ni am convinced that all our ancient formations, which are rich in fossils,\\nhave thus been formed during subsidence. since publishing my views on this\\nsubject in 1845, i have watched the progress of {292} geology, and have\\nbeen surprised to note how author after author, in treating of this or that\\ngreat formation, has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated during\\nsubsidence. i may add, that the only ancient tertiary formation on the west\\ncoast of south america, which has been bulky enough to resist such\\ndegradation as it has as yet suffered, but which will hardly last to a\\ndistant geological age, was certainly deposited during a downward\\noscillation of level, and thus gained considerable thickness.\\n\\nall geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone numerous\\nslow oscillations of level, and apparently these oscillations have affected\\nwide spaces. consequently formations rich in fossils and sufficiently thick\\nand extensive to resist subsequent degradation, may have been formed over\\nwide spaces during periods of subsidence, but only where the supply of\\nsediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and to embed and preserve\\nthe remains before they had time to decay. on the other hand, as long as\\nthe bed of the sea remained stationary, _thick_ deposits could not have\\nbeen accumulated in the shallow parts, which are the most favourable to\\nlife. still less could this have happened during the alternate periods of\\nelevation; or, to speak more accurately, the beds which were then\\naccumulated will have been destroyed by being upraised and brought within\\nthe limits of the coast-action.\\n\\nthus the geological record will almost necessarily be rendered\\nintermittent. i feel much confidence in the truth of these views, for they\\nare in strict accordance with the general principles inculcated by sir c.\\nlyell; and e. forbes subsequently but independently arrived at a similar\\nconclusion.\\n\\none remark is here worth a passing notice. during periods of elevation the\\narea of the land and of the {293} adjoining shoal parts of the sea will be\\nincreased, and new stations will often be formed;--all circumstances most\\nfavourable, as previously explained, for the formation of new varieties and\\nspecies; but during such periods there will generally be a blank in the\\ngeological record. on the other hand, during subsidence, the inhabited area\\nand number of inhabitants will decrease (excepting the productions on the\\nshores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago), and\\nconsequently during subsidence, though there will be much extinction, fewer\\nnew varieties or species will be formed; and it is during these very\\nperiods of subsidence, that our great deposits rich in fossils have been\\naccumulated. nature may almost be said to have guarded against the frequent\\ndiscovery of her transitional or linking forms.\\n\\nfrom the foregoing considerations it cannot be doubted that the geological\\nrecord, viewed as a whole, is extremely imperfect; but if we confine our\\nattention to any one formation, it becomes more difficult to understand,\\nwhy we do not therein find closely graduated varieties between the allied\\nspecies which lived at its commencement and at its close. some cases are on\\nrecord of the same species presenting distinct varieties in the upper and\\nlower parts of the same formation, but, as they are rare, they may be here\\npassed over. although each formation has indisputably required a vast\\nnumber of years for its deposition, i can see several reasons why each\\nshould not include a graduated series of links between the species which\\nthen lived; but i can by no means pretend to assign due proportional weight\\nto the following considerations.\\n\\nalthough each formation may mark a very long lapse of years, each perhaps\\nis short compared with the period requisite to change one species into\\nanother. i am {294} aware that two palг¦ontologists, whose opinions are\\nworthy of much deference, namely bronn and woodward, have concluded that\\nthe average duration of each formation is twice or thrice as long as the\\naverage duration of specific forms. but insuperable difficulties, as it\\nseems to me, prevent us coming to any just conclusion on this head. when we\\nsee a species first appearing in the middle of any formation, it would be\\nrash in the extreme to infer that it had not elsewhere previously existed.\\nso again when we find a species disappearing before the uppermost layers\\nhave been deposited, it would be equally rash to suppose that it then\\nbecame wholly extinct. we forget how small the area of europe is compared\\nwith the rest of the world; nor have the several stages of the same\\nformation throughout europe been correlated with perfect accuracy.\\n\\nwith marine animals of all kinds, we may safely infer a large amount of\\nmigration during climatal and other changes; and when we see a species\\nfirst appearing in any formation, the probability is that it only then\\nfirst immigrated into that area. it is well known, for instance, that\\nseveral species appeared somewhat earlier in the palг¦ozoic beds of north\\namerica than in those of europe; time having apparently been required for\\ntheir migration from the american to the european seas. in examining the\\nlatest deposits of various quarters of the world, it has everywhere been\\nnoted, that some few still existing species are common in the deposit, but\\nhave become extinct in the immediately surrounding sea; or, conversely,\\nthat some are now abundant in the neighbouring sea, but are rare or absent\\nin this particular deposit. it is an excellent lesson to reflect on the\\nascertained amount of migration of the inhabitants of europe during the\\nglacial period, which forms only a part of one whole geological period;\\n{295} and likewise to reflect on the great changes of level, on the\\ninordinately great change of climate, on the prodigious lapse of time, all\\nincluded within this same glacial period. yet it may be doubted whether in\\nany quarter of the world, sedimentary deposits, _including fossil remains_,\\nhave gone on accumulating within the same area during the whole of this\\nperiod. it is not, for instance, probable that sediment was deposited\\nduring the whole of the glacial period near the mouth of the mississippi,\\nwithin that limit of depth at which marine animals can flourish; for we\\nknow what vast geographical changes occurred in other parts of america\\nduring this space of time. when such beds as were deposited in shallow\\nwater near the mouth of the mississippi during some part of the glacial\\nperiod shall have been upraised, organic remains will probably first appear\\nand disappear at different levels, owing to the migration of species and to\\ngeographical changes. and in the distant future, a geologist examining\\nthese beds, might be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life\\nof the embedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period,\\ninstead of having been really far greater, that is extending from before\\nthe glacial epoch to the present day.\\n\\nin order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper and\\nlower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have gone on\\naccumulating for a very long period, in order to have given sufficient time\\nfor the slow process of variation; hence the deposit will generally have to\\nbe a very thick one; and the species undergoing modification will have had\\nto live on the same area throughout this whole time. but we have seen that\\na thick fossiliferous formation can only be accumulated during a period of\\nsubsidence; and to keep the depth approximately the same, which is\\nnecessary in {296} order to enable the same species to live on the same\\nspace, the supply of sediment must nearly have counterbalanced the amount\\nof subsidence. but this same movement of subsidence will often tend to sink\\nthe area whence the sediment is derived, and thus diminish the supply\\nwhilst the downward movement continues. in fact, this nearly exact\\nbalancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of subsidence is\\nprobably a rare contingency; for it has been observed by more than one\\npalг¦ontologist, that very thick deposits are usually barren of organic\\nremains, except near their upper or lower limits.\\n\\nit would seem that each separate formation, like the whole pile of\\nformations in any country, has generally been intermittent in its\\naccumulation. when we see, as is so often the case, a formation composed of\\nbeds of different mineralogical composition, we may reasonably suspect that\\nthe process of deposition has been much interrupted, as a change in the\\ncurrents of the sea and a supply of sediment of a different nature will\\ngenerally have been due to geographical changes requiring much time. nor\\nwill the closest inspection of a formation give any idea of the time which\\nits deposition has consumed. many instances could be given of beds only a\\nfew feet in thickness, representing formations, elsewhere thousands of feet\\nin thickness, and which must have required an enormous period for their\\naccumulation; yet no one ignorant of this fact would have suspected the\\nvast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation. many cases could\\nbe given of the lower beds of a formation having been upraised, denuded,\\nsubmerged, and then re-covered by the upper beds of the same\\nformation,--facts, showing what wide, yet easily overlooked, intervals have\\noccurred in its accumulation. in other cases we have the plainest evidence\\n{297} in great fossilised trees, still standing upright as they grew, of\\nmany long intervals of time and changes of level during the process of\\ndeposition, which would never even have been suspected, had not the trees\\nchanced to have been preserved: thus messrs. lyell and dawson found\\ncarboniferous beds 1400 feet thick in nova scotia, with ancient\\nroot-bearing strata, one above the other, at no less than sixty-eight\\ndifferent levels. hence, when the same species occur at the bottom, middle,\\nand top of a formation, the probability is that they have not lived on the\\nsame spot during the whole period of deposition, but have disappeared and\\nreappeared, perhaps many times, during the same geological period. so that\\nif such species were to undergo a considerable amount of modification\\nduring any one geological period, a section would not probably include all\\nthe fine intermediate gradations which must on my theory have existed\\nbetween them, but abrupt, though perhaps very slight, changes of form.\\n\\nit is all-important to remember that naturalists have no golden rule by\\nwhich to distinguish species and varieties; they grant some little\\nvariability to each species, but when they meet with a somewhat greater\\namount of difference between any two forms, they rank both as species,\\nunless they are enabled to connect them together by close intermediate\\ngradations. and this from the reasons just assigned we can seldom hope to\\neffect in any one geological section. supposing b and c to be two species,\\nand a third, a, to be found in an underlying bed; even if a were strictly\\nintermediate between b and c, it would simply be ranked as a third and\\ndistinct species, unless at the same time it could be most closely\\nconnected with either one or both forms by intermediate varieties. nor\\nshould it be forgotten, as before explained, that a might be the actual\\nprogenitor {298} of b and c, and yet might not at all necessarily be\\nstrictly intermediate between them in all points of structure. so that we\\nmight obtain the parent-species and its several modified descendants from\\nthe lower and upper beds of a formation, and unless we obtained numerous\\ntransitional gradations, we should not recognise their relationship, and\\nshould consequently be compelled to rank them all as distinct species.\\n\\nit is notorious on what excessively slight differences many palг¦ontologists\\nhave founded their species; and they do this the more readily if the\\nspecimens come from different sub-stages of the same formation. some\\nexperienced conchologists are now sinking many of the very fine species of\\nd\\'orbigny and others into the rank of varieties; and on this view we do\\nfind the kind of evidence of change which on my theory we ought to find.\\nmoreover, if we look to rather wider intervals, namely, to distinct but\\nconsecutive stages of the same great formation, we find that the embedded\\nfossils, though almost universally ranked as specifically different, yet\\nare far more closely allied to each other than are the species found in\\nmore widely separated formations; but to this subject i shall have to\\nreturn in the following chapter.\\n\\none other consideration is worth notice: with animals and plants that can\\npropagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive, there is reason to\\nsuspect, as we have formerly seen, that their varieties are generally at\\nfirst local; and that such local varieties do not spread widely and\\nsupplant their parent-forms until they have been modified and perfected in\\nsome considerable degree. according to this view, the chance of discovering\\nin a formation in any one country all the early stages of transition\\nbetween any two forms, is small, for the successive changes are supposed to\\nhave been local or {299} confined to some one spot. most marine animals\\nhave a wide range; and we have seen that with plants it is those which have\\nthe widest range, that oftenest present varieties; so that with shells and\\nother marine animals, it is probably those which have had the widest range,\\nfar exceeding the limits of the known geological formations of europe,\\nwhich have oftenest given rise, first to local varieties and ultimately to\\nnew species; and this again would greatly lessen the chance of our being\\nable to trace the stages of transition in any one geological formation.\\n\\nit should not be forgotten, that at the present day, with perfect specimens\\nfor examination, two forms can seldom be connected by intermediate\\nvarieties and thus proved to be the same species, until many specimens have\\nbeen collected from many places; and in the case of fossil species this\\ncould rarely be effected by palг¦ontologists. we shall, perhaps, best\\nperceive the improbability of our being enabled to connect species by\\nnumerous, fine, intermediate, fossil links, by asking ourselves whether,\\nfor instance, geologists at some future period will be able to prove, that\\nour different breeds of cattle, sheep, horses, and dogs have descended from\\na single stock or from several aboriginal stocks; or, again, whether\\ncertain sea-shells inhabiting the shores of north america, which are ranked\\nby some conchologists as distinct species from their european\\nrepresentatives, and by other conchologists as only varieties, are really\\nvarieties or are, as it is called, specifically distinct. this could be\\neffected only by the future geologist discovering in a fossil state\\nnumerous intermediate gradations; and such success seems to me improbable\\nin the highest degree.\\n\\ngeological research, though it has added numerous species to existing and\\nextinct genera, and has made the {300} intervals between some few groups\\nless wide than they otherwise would have been, yet has done scarcely\\nanything in breaking down the distinction between species, by connecting\\nthem together by numerous, fine, intermediate varieties; and this not\\nhaving been effected, is probably the gravest and most obvious of all the\\nmany objections which may be urged against my views. hence it will be worth\\nwhile to sum up the foregoing remarks, under an imaginary illustration. the\\nmalay archipelago is of about the size of europe from the north cape to the\\nmediterranean, and from britain to russia; and therefore equals all the\\ngeological formations which have been examined with any accuracy, excepting\\nthose of the united states of america. i fully agree with mr.\\ngodwin-austen, that the present condition of the malay archipelago, with\\nits numerous large islands separated by wide and shallow seas, probably\\nrepresents the former state of europe, whilst most of our formations were\\naccumulating. the malay archipelago is one of the richest regions of the\\nwhole world in organic beings; yet if all the species were to be collected\\nwhich have ever lived there, how imperfectly would they represent the\\nnatural history of the world!\\n\\nbut we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of the\\narchipelago would be preserved in an excessively imperfect manner in the\\nformations which we suppose to be there accumulating. i suspect that not\\nmany of the strictly littoral animals, or of those which lived on naked\\nsubmarine rocks, would be embedded; and those embedded in gravel or sand,\\nwould not endure to a distant epoch. wherever sediment did not accumulate\\non the bed of the sea, or where it did not accumulate at a sufficient rate\\nto protect organic bodies from decay, no remains could be preserved.\\n\\ni believe that fossiliferous formations could be formed {301} in the\\narchipelago, of thickness sufficient to last to an age as distant in\\nfuturity as the secondary formations lie in the past, only during periods\\nof subsidence. these periods of subsidence would be separated from each\\nother by enormous intervals, during which the area would be either\\nstationary or rising; whilst rising, each fossiliferous formation would be\\ndestroyed, almost as soon as accumulated, by the incessant coast-action, as\\nwe now see on the shores of south america. during the periods of subsidence\\nthere would probably be much extinction of life; during the periods of\\nelevation, there would be much variation, but the geological record would\\nthen be least perfect.\\n\\nit may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of\\nsubsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago, together with a\\ncontemporaneous accumulation of sediment, would _exceed_ the average\\nduration of the same specific forms; and these contingencies are\\nindispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations\\nbetween any two or more species. if such gradations were not fully\\npreserved, transitional varieties would merely appear as so many distinct\\nspecies. it is, also, probable that each great period of subsidence would\\nbe interrupted by oscillations of level, and that slight climatal changes\\nwould intervene during such lengthy periods; and in these cases the\\ninhabitants of the archipelago would have to migrate, and no closely\\nconsecutive record of their modifications could be preserved in any one\\nformation.\\n\\nvery many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range thousands\\nof miles beyond its confines; and analogy leads me to believe that it would\\nbe chiefly these far-ranging species which would oftenest produce new\\nvarieties; and the varieties would at first generally be local or confined\\nto one place, but if possessed {302} of any decided advantage, or when\\nfurther modified and improved, they would slowly spread and supplant their\\nparent-forms. when such varieties returned to their ancient homes, as they\\nwould differ from their former state, in a nearly uniform, though perhaps\\nextremely slight degree, they would, according to the principles followed\\nby many palг¦ontologists, be ranked as new and distinct species.\\n\\nif then, there be some degree of truth in these remarks, we have no right\\nto expect to find in our geological formations, an infinite number of those\\nfine transitional forms, which on my theory assuredly have connected all\\nthe past and present species of the same group into one long and branching\\nchain of life. we ought only to look for a few links, some more closely,\\nsome more distantly related to each other; and these links, let them be\\never so close, if found in different stages of the same formation, would,\\nby most palг¦ontologists, be ranked as distinct species. but i do not\\npretend that i should ever have suspected how poor a record of the\\nmutations of life, the best preserved geological section presented, had not\\nthe difficulty of our not discovering innumerable transitional links\\nbetween the species which appeared at the commencement and close of each\\nformation, pressed so hardly on my theory.\\n\\n\\n\\n_on the sudden appearance of whole groups of allied species._--the abrupt\\nmanner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in certain\\nformations, has been urged by several palг¦ontologists--for instance, by\\nagassiz, pictet, and by none more forcibly than by professor sedgwick--as a\\nfatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species. if numerous\\nspecies, belonging to the same genera or families, have really {303}\\nstarted into life all at once, the fact would be fatal to the theory of\\ndescent with slow modification through natural selection. for the\\ndevelopment of a group of forms, all of which have descended from some one\\nprogenitor, must have been an extremely slow process; and the progenitors\\nmust have lived long ages before their modified descendants. but we\\ncontinually over-rate the perfection of the geological record, and falsely\\ninfer, because certain genera or families have not been found beneath a\\ncertain stage, that they did not exist before that stage. we continually\\nforget how large the world is, compared with the area over which our\\ngeological formations have been carefully examined; we forget that groups\\nof species may elsewhere have long existed and have slowly multiplied\\nbefore they invaded the ancient archipelagoes of europe and of the united\\nstates. we do not make due allowance for the enormous intervals of time,\\nwhich have probably elapsed between our consecutive formations,--longer\\nperhaps in most cases than the time required for the accumulation of each\\nformation. these intervals will have given time for the multiplication of\\nspecies from some one or some few parent-forms; and in the succeeding\\nformation such species will appear as if suddenly created.\\n\\ni may here recall a remark formerly made, namely that it might require a\\nlong succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar line\\nof life, for instance to fly through the air; but that when this had been\\neffected, and a few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other\\norganisms, a comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many\\ndivergent forms, which would be able to spread rapidly and widely\\nthroughout the world.\\n\\ni will now give a few examples to illustrate these {304} remarks, and to\\nshow how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of species\\nhave suddenly been produced. i may recall the well-known fact that in\\ngeological treatises, published not many years ago, the great class of\\nmammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement\\nof the tertiary series. and now one of the richest known accumulations of\\nfossil mammals, for its thickness, belongs to the middle of the secondary\\nseries; and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstone at\\nnearly the commencement of this great series. cuvier used to urge that no\\nmonkey occurred in any tertiary stratum; but now extinct species have been\\ndiscovered in india, south america, and in europe even as far back as the\\neocene stage. had it not been for the rare accident of the preservation of\\nfootsteps in the new red sandstone of the united states, who would have\\nventured to suppose that, besides reptiles, no less than at least thirty\\nkinds of birds, some of gigantic size, existed during that period? not a\\nfragment of bone has been discovered in these beds. notwithstanding that\\nthe number of joints shown in the fossil impressions correspond with the\\nnumber in the several toes of living birds\\' feet, some authors doubt\\nwhether the animals which left the impressions were really birds. until\\nquite recently these authors might have maintained, and some have\\nmaintained, that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence\\nduring an early tertiary period; but now we know, on the authority of\\nprofessor owen (as may be seen in lyell\\'s \\'manual\\'), that a bird certainly\\nlived during the deposition of the upper greensand.\\n\\ni may give another instance, which from having passed under my own eyes has\\nmuch struck me. in a memoir on fossil sessile cirripedes, i have stated\\nthat, from the {305} number of existing and extinct tertiary species; from\\nthe extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species all over the\\nworld, from the arctic regions to the equator, inhabiting various zones of\\ndepths from the upper tidal limits to 50 fathoms; from the perfect manner\\nin which specimens are preserved in the oldest tertiary beds; from the ease\\nwith which even a fragment of a valve can be recognised; from all these\\ncircumstances, i inferred that had sessile cirripedes existed during the\\nsecondary periods, they would certainly have been preserved and discovered;\\nand as not one species had then been discovered in beds of this age, i\\nconcluded that this great group had been suddenly developed at the\\ncommencement of the tertiary series. this was a sore trouble to me, adding\\nas i thought one more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of\\nspecies. but my work had hardly been published, when a skilful\\npalг¦ontologist, m. bosquet, sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an\\nunmistakeable sessile cirripede, which he had himself extracted from the\\nchalk of belgium. and, as if to make the case as striking as possible, this\\nsessile cirripede was a chthamalus, a very common, large, and ubiquitous\\ngenus, of which not one specimen has as yet been found even in any tertiary\\nstratum. hence we now positively know that sessile cirripedes existed\\nduring the secondary period; and these cirripedes might have been the\\nprogenitors of our many tertiary and existing species.\\n\\nthe case most frequently insisted on by palг¦ontologists of the apparently\\nsudden appearance of a whole group of species, is that of the teleostean\\nfishes, low down in the chalk period. this group includes the large\\nmajority of existing species. lately, professor pictet has carried their\\nexistence one sub-stage further back; and some palг¦ontologists believe that\\ncertain {306} much older fishes, of which the affinities are as yet\\nimperfectly known, are really teleostean. assuming, however, that the whole\\nof them did appear, as agassiz believes, at the commencement of the chalk\\nformation, the fact would certainly be highly remarkable; but i cannot see\\nthat it would be an insuperable difficulty on my theory, unless it could\\nlikewise be shown that the species of this group appeared suddenly and\\nsimultaneously throughout the world at this same period. it is almost\\nsuperfluous to remark that hardly any fossil-fish are known from south of\\nthe equator; and by running through pictet\\'s palг¦ontology it will be seen\\nthat very few species are known from several formations in europe. some few\\nfamilies of fish now have a confined range; the teleostean fish might\\nformerly have had a similarly confined range, and after having been largely\\ndeveloped in some one sea, might have spread widely. nor have we any right\\nto suppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely open from\\nsouth to north as they are at present. even at this day, if the malay\\narchipelago were converted into land, the tropical parts of the indian\\nocean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin, in which any great\\ngroup of marine animals might be multiplied; and here they would remain\\nconfined, until some of the species became adapted to a cooler climate, and\\nwere enabled to double the southern capes of africa or australia, and thus\\nreach other and distant seas.\\n\\nfrom these and similar considerations, but chiefly from our ignorance of\\nthe geology of other countries beyond the confines of europe and the united\\nstates; and from the revolution in our palг¦ontological ideas on many\\npoints, which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected,\\nit seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of\\norganic {307} beings throughout the world, as it would be for a naturalist\\nto land for five minutes on some one barren point in australia, and then to\\ndiscuss the number and range of its productions.\\n\\n\\n\\n_on the sudden appearance of groups of allied species in the lowest known\\nfossiliferous strata._--there is another and allied difficulty, which is\\nmuch graver. i allude to the manner in which numbers of species of the same\\ngroup, suddenly appear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks. most of the\\narguments which have convinced me that all the existing species of the same\\ngroup have descended from one progenitor, apply with nearly equal force to\\nthe earliest known species. for instance, i cannot doubt that all the\\nsilurian trilobites have descended from some one crustacean, which must\\nhave lived long before the silurian age, and which probably differed\\ngreatly from any known animal. some of the most ancient silurian animals,\\nas the nautilus, lingula, &c., do not differ much from living species; and\\nit cannot on my theory be supposed, that these old species were the\\nprogenitors of all the species of the orders to which they belong, for they\\ndo not present characters in any degree intermediate between them. if,\\nmoreover, they had been the progenitors of these orders, they would almost\\ncertainly have been long ago supplanted and exterminated by their numerous\\nand improved descendants.\\n\\nconsequently, if my theory be true, it is indisputable that before the\\nlowest silurian stratum was deposited, long periods elapsed, as long as, or\\nprobably far longer than, the whole interval from the silurian age to the\\npresent day; and that during these vast, yet quite unknown, periods of\\ntime, the world swarmed with living creatures. {308}\\n\\nto the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial\\nperiods, i can give no satisfactory answer. several of the most eminent\\ngeologists, with sir e. murchison at their head, are convinced that we see\\nin the organic remains of the lowest silurian stratum the dawn of life on\\nthis planet. other highly competent judges, as lyell and the late e.\\nforbes, dispute this conclusion. we should not forget that only a small\\nportion of the world is known with accuracy. m. barrande has lately added\\nanother and lower stage to the silurian system, abounding with new and\\npeculiar species. traces of life have been detected in the longmynd beds,\\nbeneath barrande\\'s so-called primordial zone. the presence of phosphatic\\nnodules and bituminous matter in some of the lowest azoic rocks, probably\\nindicates the former existence of life at these periods. but the difficulty\\nof understanding the absence of vast piles of fossiliferous strata, which\\non my theory no doubt were somewhere accumulated before the silurian epoch,\\nis very great. if these most ancient beds had been wholly worn away by\\ndenudation, or obliterated by metamorphic action, we ought to find only\\nsmall remnants of the formations next succeeding them in age, and these\\nought to be very generally in a metamorphosed condition. but the\\ndescriptions which we now possess of the silurian deposits over immense\\nterritories in russia and in north america, do not support the view, that\\nthe older a formation is, the more it has always suffered the extremity of\\ndenudation and metamorphism.\\n\\nthe case at present must remain inexplicable; and may be truly urged as a\\nvalid argument against the views here entertained. to show that it may\\nhereafter receive some explanation, i will give the following hypothesis.\\nfrom the nature of the organic remains which {309} do not appear to have\\ninhabited profound depths, in the several formations of europe and of the\\nunited states; and from the amount of sediment, miles in thickness, of\\nwhich the formations are composed, we may infer that from first to last\\nlarge islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was derived, occurred\\nin the neighbourhood of the existing continents of europe and north\\namerica. but we do not know what was the state of things in the intervals\\nbetween the successive formations; whether europe and the united states\\nduring these intervals existed as dry land, or as a submarine surface near\\nland, on which sediment was not deposited, or as the bed of an open and\\nunfathomable sea.\\n\\nlooking to the existing oceans, which are thrice as extensive as the land,\\nwe see them studded with many islands; but not one oceanic island is as yet\\nknown to afford even a remnant of any palг¦ozoic or secondary formation.\\nhence we may perhaps infer, that during the palг¦ozoic and secondary\\nperiods, neither continents nor continental islands existed where our\\noceans now extend; for had they existed there, palг¦ozoic and secondary\\nformations would in all probability have been accumulated from sediment\\nderived from their wear and tear; and would have been at least partially\\nupheaved by the oscillations of level, which we may fairly conclude must\\nhave intervened during these enormously long periods. if then we may infer\\nanything from these facts, we may infer that where our oceans now extend,\\noceans have extended from the remotest period of which we have any record;\\nand on the other hand, that where continents now exist, large tracts of\\nland have existed, subjected no doubt to great oscillations of level, since\\nthe earliest silurian period. the coloured map appended to my volume on\\ncoral reefs, led me to conclude that the great oceans are still mainly\\nareas of {310} subsidence, the great archipelagoes still areas of\\noscillations of level, and the continents areas of elevation. but have we\\nany right to assume that things have thus remained from the beginning of\\nthis world? our continents seem to have been formed by a preponderance,\\nduring many oscillations of level, of the force of elevation; but may not\\nthe areas of preponderant movement have changed in the lapse of ages? at a\\nperiod immeasurably antecedent to the silurian epoch, continents may have\\nexisted where oceans are now spread out; and clear and open oceans may have\\nexisted where our continents now stand. nor should we be justified in\\nassuming that if, for instance, the bed of the pacific ocean were now\\nconverted into a continent, we should there find formations older than the\\nsilurian strata, supposing such to have been formerly deposited; for it\\nmight well happen that strata which had subsided some miles nearer to the\\ncentre of the earth, and which had been pressed on by an enormous weight of\\nsuperincumbent water, might have undergone far more metamorphic action than\\nstrata which have always remained nearer to the surface. the immense areas\\nin some parts of the world, for instance in south america, of bare\\nmetamorphic rocks, which must have been heated under great pressure, have\\nalways seemed to me to require some special explanation; and we may perhaps\\nbelieve that we see in these large areas, the many formations long anterior\\nto the silurian epoch in a completely metamorphosed condition.\\n\\n\\n\\nthe several difficulties here discussed, namely our not finding in the\\nsuccessive formations infinitely numerous transitional links between the\\nmany species which now exist or have existed; the sudden manner {311} in\\nwhich whole groups of species appear in our european formations; the almost\\nentire absence, as at present known, of fossiliferous formations beneath\\nthe silurian strata, are all undoubtedly of the gravest nature. we see this\\nin the plainest manner by the fact that all the most eminent\\npalг¦ontologists, namely cuvier, agassiz, barrande, falconer, e. forbes,\\n&c., and all our greatest geologists, as lyell, murchison, sedgwick, &c.,\\nhave unanimously, often vehemently, maintained the immutability of species.\\nbut i have reason to believe that one great authority, sir charles lyell,\\nfrom further reflexion entertains grave doubts on this subject. i feel how\\nrash it is to differ from these authorities, to whom, with others, we owe\\nall our knowledge. those who think the natural geological record in any\\ndegree perfect, and who do not attach much weight to the facts and\\narguments of other kinds given in this volume, will undoubtedly at once\\nreject my theory. for my part, following out lyell\\'s metaphor, i look at\\nthe natural geological record, as a history of the world imperfectly kept,\\nand written in a changing dialect; of this history we possess the last\\nvolume alone, relating only to two or three countries. of this volume, only\\nhere and there a short chapter has been preserved; and of each page, only\\nhere and there a few lines. each word of the slowly-changing language, in\\nwhich the history is supposed to be written, being more or less different\\nin the interrupted succession of chapters, may represent the apparently\\nabruptly changed forms of life, entombed in our consecutive, but widely\\nseparated, formations. on this view, the difficulties above discussed are\\ngreatly diminished, or even disappear.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{312}\\n\\nchapter x.\\n\\non the geological succession of organic

species to each other and to living species--on the state of\\n    development of ancient forms--on the succession of the same types\\n    within the same areas--summary of preceding and present chapters.\\n\\nlet us now see whether the several facts and rules relating to the\\ngeological succession of organic beings, better accord with the common view\\nof the immutability of species, or with that of their slow and gradual\\nmodification, through descent and natural selection.\\n\\nnew species have appeared very slowly, one after another, both on the land\\nand in the waters. lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to resist the\\nevidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary stages; and every\\nyear tends to fill up the blanks between them, and to make the percentage\\nsystem of lost and new forms more gradual. in some of the most recent beds,\\nthough undoubtedly of high antiquity if measured by years, only one or two\\nspecies are lost forms, and only one or two are new forms, having here\\nappeared for the first time, either locally, or, as far as we know, on the\\nface of the earth. if we may trust the observations of philippi in sicily,\\nthe successive changes in the marine inhabitants of that island have been\\nmany and most gradual. the secondary formations are more broken; but, as\\nbronn has remarked, neither the appearance {313} nor disappearance of their\\nmany now extinct species has been simultaneous in each separate formation.\\n\\nspecies of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate,\\nor in the same degree. in the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may\\nstill be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms. falconer has\\ngiven a striking instance of a similar fact, in an existing crocodile\\nassociated with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles in the\\nsub-himalayan deposits. the silurian lingula differs but little from the\\nliving species of this genus; whereas most of the other silurian molluscs\\nand all the crustaceans have changed greatly. the productions of the land\\nseem to change at a quicker rate than those of the sea, of which a striking\\ninstance has lately been observed in switzerland. there is some reason to\\nbelieve that organisms, considered high in the scale of nature, change more\\nquickly than those that are low: though there are exceptions to this rule.\\nthe amount of organic change, as pictet has remarked, does not strictly\\ncorrespond with the succession of our geological formations; so that\\nbetween each two consecutive formations, the forms of life have seldom\\nchanged in exactly the same degree. yet if we compare any but the most\\nclosely related formations, all the species will be found to have undergone\\nsome change. when a species has once disappeared from the face of the\\nearth, we have reason to believe that the same identical form never\\nreappears. the strongest apparent exception to this latter rule, is that of\\nthe so-called \"colonies\" of m. barrande, which intrude for a period in the\\nmidst of an older formation, and then allow the pre-existing fauna to\\nreappear; but lyell\\'s explanation, namely, that it is a case of temporary\\nmigration from a distinct geographical province, seems to me satisfactory.\\n{314}\\n\\nthese several facts accord well with my theory. i believe in no fixed law\\nof development, causing all the inhabitants of a country to change\\nabruptly, or simultaneously, or to an equal degree. the process of\\nmodification must be extremely slow. the variability of each species is\\nquite independent of that of all others. whether such variability be taken\\nadvantage of by natural selection, and whether the variations be\\naccumulated to a greater or lesser amount, thus causing a greater or lesser\\namount of modification in the varying species, depends on many complex\\ncontingencies,--on the variability being of a beneficial nature, on the\\npower of intercrossing, on the rate of breeding, on the slowly changing\\nphysical conditions of the country, and more especially on the nature of\\nthe other inhabitants with which the varying species comes into\\ncompetition. hence it is by no means surprising that one species should\\nretain the same identical form much longer than others; or, if changing,\\nthat it should change less. we see the same fact in geographical\\ndistribution; for instance, in the land-shells and coleopterous insects of\\nmadeira having come to differ considerably from their nearest allies on the\\ncontinent of europe, whereas the marine shells and birds have remained\\nunaltered. we can perhaps understand the apparently quicker rate of change\\nin terrestrial and in more highly organised productions compared with\\nmarine and lower productions, by the more complex relations of the higher\\nbeings to their organic and inorganic conditions of life, as explained in a\\nformer chapter. when many of the inhabitants of a country have become\\nmodified and improved, we can understand, on the principle of competition,\\nand on that of the many all-important relations of organism to organism,\\nthat any form which does not become in some degree modified and improved,\\n{315} will be liable to be exterminated. hence we can see why all the\\nspecies in the same region do at last, if we look to wide enough intervals\\nof time, become modified; for those which do not change will become\\nextinct.\\n\\nin members of the same class the average amount of change, during long and\\nequal periods of time, may, perhaps, be nearly the same; but as the\\naccumulation of long-enduring fossiliferous formations depends on great\\nmasses of sediment having been deposited on areas whilst subsiding, our\\nformations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly\\nintermittent intervals; consequently the amount of organic change exhibited\\nby the fossils embedded in consecutive formations is not equal. each\\nformation, on this view, does not mark a new and complete act of creation,\\nbut only an occasional scene, taken almost at hazard, in a slowly changing\\ndrama.\\n\\nwe can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never\\nreappear, even if the very same conditions of life, organic and inorganic,\\nshould recur. for though the offspring of one species might be adapted (and\\nno doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances) to fill the exact\\nplace of another species in the economy of nature, and thus supplant it;\\nyet the two forms--the old and the new--would not be identically the same;\\nfor both would almost certainly inherit different characters from their\\ndistinct progenitors. for instance, it is just possible, if our\\nfantail-pigeons were all destroyed, that fanciers, by striving during long\\nages for the same object, might make a new breed hardly distinguishable\\nfrom our present fantail; but if the parent rock-pigeon were also\\ndestroyed, and in nature we have every reason to believe that the\\nparent-form will generally be supplanted and exterminated by its improved\\noffspring, it is quite {316} incredible that a fantail, identical with the\\nexisting breed, could be raised from any other species of pigeon, or even\\nfrom the other well-established races of the domestic pigeon, for the\\nnewly-formed fantail would be almost sure to inherit from its new\\nprogenitor some slight characteristic differences.\\n\\ngroups of species, that is, genera and families, follow the same general\\nrules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species, changing\\nmore or less quickly, and in a greater or lesser degree. a group does not\\nreappear after it has once disappeared; or its existence, as long as it\\nlasts, is continuous. i am aware that there are some apparent exceptions to\\nthis rule, but the exceptions are surprisingly few, so few that e. forbes,\\npictet, and woodward (though all strongly opposed to such views as i\\nmaintain) admit its truth; and the rule strictly accords with my theory.\\nfor as all the species of the same group have descended from some one\\nspecies, it is clear that as long as any species of the group have appeared\\nin the long succession of ages, so long must its members have continuously\\nexisted, in order to have generated either new and modified or the same old\\nand unmodified forms. species of the genus lingula, for instance, must have\\ncontinuously existed by an unbroken succession of generations, from the\\nlowest silurian stratum to the present day.\\n\\nwe have seen in the last chapter that the species of a group sometimes\\nfalsely appear to have come in abruptly; and i have attempted to give an\\nexplanation of this fact, which if true would have been fatal to my views.\\nbut such cases are certainly exceptional; the general rule being a gradual\\nincrease in number, till the group reaches its maximum, and then, sooner or\\nlater, it gradually decreases. if the number of the species of a genus, or\\nthe number of {317} the genera of a family, be represented by a vertical\\nline of varying thickness, crossing the successive geological formations in\\nwhich the species are found, the line will sometimes falsely appear to\\nbegin at its lower end, not in a sharp point, but abruptly; it then\\ngradually thickens upwards, sometimes keeping for a space of equal\\nthickness, and ultimately thins out in the upper beds, marking the decrease\\nand final extinction of the species. this gradual increase in number of the\\nspecies of a group is strictly conformable with my theory; as the species\\nof the same genus, and the genera of the same family, can increase only\\nslowly and progressively; for the process of modification and the\\nproduction of a number of allied forms must be slow and gradual,--one\\nspecies giving rise first to two or three varieties, these being slowly\\nconverted into species, which in their turn produce by equally slow steps\\nother species, and so on, like the branching of a great tree from a single\\nstem, till the group becomes large.\\n\\n\\n\\n_on extinction._--we have as yet spoken only incidentally of the\\ndisappearance of species and of groups of species. on the theory of natural\\nselection the extinction of old forms and the production of new and\\nimproved forms are intimately connected together. the old notion of all the\\ninhabitants of the earth having been swept away at successive periods by\\ncatastrophes, is very generally given up, even by those geologists, as elie\\nde beaumont, murchison, barrande, &c, whose general views would naturally\\nlead them to this conclusion. on the contrary, we have every reason to\\nbelieve, from the study of the tertiary formations, that species and groups\\nof species gradually disappear, one after another, first from one spot,\\nthen from another, and finally from the world. both single species and\\nwhole {318} groups of species last for very unequal periods; some groups,\\nas we have seen, having endured from the earliest known dawn of life to the\\npresent day; some having disappeared before the close of the palг¦ozoic\\nperiod. no fixed law seems to determine the length of time during which any\\nsingle species or any single genus endures. there is reason to believe that\\nthe complete extinction of the species of a group is generally a slower\\nprocess than their production: if the appearance and disappearance of a\\ngroup of species be represented, as before, by a vertical line of varying\\nthickness, the line is found to taper more gradually at its upper end,\\nwhich marks the progress of extermination, than at its lower end, which\\nmarks the first appearance and increase in numbers of the species. in some\\ncases, however, the extermination of whole groups of beings, as of\\nammonites towards the close of the secondary period, has been wonderfully\\nsudden.\\n\\nthe whole subject of the extinction of species has been involved in the\\nmost gratuitous mystery. some authors have even supposed that as the\\nindividual has a definite length of life, so have species a definite\\nduration. no one i think can have marvelled more at the extinction of\\nspecies, than i have done. when i found in la plata the tooth of a horse\\nembedded with the remains of mastodon, megatherium, toxodon, and other\\nextinct monsters, which all co-existed with still living shells at a very\\nlate geological period, i was filled with astonishment; for seeing that the\\nhorse, since its introduction by the spaniards into south america, has run\\nwild over the whole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled\\nrate, i asked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former\\nhorse under conditions of life apparently so favourable. but how utterly\\ngroundless was my astonishment! {319} professor owen soon perceived that\\nthe tooth, though so like that of the existing horse, belonged to an\\nextinct species. had this horse been still living, but in some degree rare,\\nno naturalist would have felt the least surprise at its rarity; for rarity\\nis the attribute of a vast number of species of all classes, in all\\ncountries. if we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare, we answer\\nthat something is unfavourable in its conditions of life; but what that\\nsomething is, we can hardly ever tell. on the supposition of the fossil\\nhorse still existing as a rare species, we might have felt certain from the\\nanalogy of all other mammals, even of the slow-breeding elephant, and from\\nthe history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in south america,\\nthat under more favourable conditions it would in a very few years have\\nstocked the whole continent. but we could not have told what the\\nunfavourable conditions were which checked its increase, whether some one\\nor several contingencies, and at what period of the horse\\'s life, and in\\nwhat degree, they severally acted. if the conditions had gone on, however\\nslowly, becoming less and less favourable, we assuredly should not have\\nperceived the fact, yet the fossil horse would certainly have become rarer\\nand rarer, and finally extinct;--its place being seized on by some more\\nsuccessful competitor.\\n\\nit is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every living\\nbeing is constantly being checked by unperceived injurious agencies; and\\nthat these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient to cause rarity,\\nand finally extinction. we see in many cases in the more recent tertiary\\nformations, that rarity precedes extinction; and we know that this has been\\nthe progress of events with those animals which have been exterminated,\\neither locally or wholly, through {320} man\\'s agency. i may repeat what i\\npublished in 1845, namely, that to admit that species generally become rare\\nbefore they become extinct--to feel no surprise at the rarity of a species,\\nand yet to marvel greatly when it ceases to exist, is much the same as to\\nadmit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of death--to feel\\nno surprise at sickness, but when the sick man dies, to wonder and to\\nsuspect that he died by some unknown deed of violence.\\n\\nthe theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new\\nvariety, and ultimately each new species, is produced and maintained by\\nhaving some advantage over those with which it comes into competition; and\\nthe consequent extinction of less-favoured forms almost inevitably follows.\\nit is the same with our domestic productions: when a new and slightly\\nimproved variety has been raised, it at first supplants the less improved\\nvarieties in the same neighbourhood; when much improved it is transported\\nfar and near, like our short-horn cattle, and takes the place of other\\nbreeds in other countries. thus the appearance of new forms and the\\ndisappearance of old forms, both natural and artificial, are bound\\ntogether. in certain flourishing groups, the number of new specific forms\\nwhich have been produced within a given time is probably greater than that\\nof the old specific forms which have been exterminated; but we know that\\nthe number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing, at least\\nduring the later geological periods, so that looking to later times we may\\nbelieve that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about\\nthe same number of old forms.\\n\\nthe competition will generally be most severe, as formerly explained and\\nillustrated by examples, between the forms which are most like each other\\nin all respects. {321} hence the improved and modified descendants of a\\nspecies will generally cause the extermination of the parent-species; and\\nif many new forms have been developed from any one species, the nearest\\nallies of that species, _i.e._ the species of the same genus, will be the\\nmost liable to extermination. thus, as i believe, a number of new species\\ndescended from one species, that is a new genus, comes to supplant an old\\ngenus, belonging to the same family. but it must often have happened that a\\nnew species belonging to some one group will have seized on the place\\noccupied by a species belonging to a distinct group, and thus caused its\\nextermination; and if many allied forms be developed from the successful\\nintruder, many will have to yield their places; and it will generally be\\nallied forms, which will suffer from some inherited inferiority in common.\\nbut whether it be species belonging to the same or to a distinct class,\\nwhich yield their places to other species which have been modified and\\nimproved, a few of the sufferers may often long be preserved, from being\\nfitted to some peculiar line of life, or from inhabiting some distant and\\nisolated station, where they have escaped severe competition. for instance,\\na single species of trigonia, a great genus of shells in the secondary\\nformations, survives in the australian seas; and a few members of the great\\nand almost extinct group of ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters.\\ntherefore the utter extinction of a group is generally, as we have seen, a\\nslower process than its production.\\n\\nwith respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or\\norders, as of trilobites at the close of the palг¦ozoic period and of\\nammonites at the close of the secondary period, we must remember what has\\nbeen already said on the probable wide intervals of time {322} between our\\nconsecutive formations; and in these intervals there may have been much\\nslow extermination. moreover, when by sudden immigration or by unusually\\nrapid development, many species of a new group have taken possession of a\\nnew area, they will have exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner\\nmany of the old inhabitants; and the forms which thus yield their places\\nwill commonly be allied, for they will partake of some inferiority in\\ncommon.\\n\\nthus, as it seems to me, the manner in which single species and whole\\ngroups of species become extinct, accords well with the theory of natural\\nselection. we need not marvel at extinction; if we must marvel, let it be\\nat our presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand the many\\ncomplex contingencies, on which the existence of each species depends. if\\nwe forget for an instant, that each species tends to increase inordinately,\\nand that some check is always in action, yet seldom perceived by us, the\\nwhole economy of nature will be utterly obscured. whenever we can precisely\\nsay why this species is more abundant in individuals than that; why this\\nspecies and not another can be naturalised in a given country; then, and\\nnot till then, we may justly feel surprise why we cannot account for the\\nextinction of this particular species or group of species.\\n\\n\\n\\n_on the forms of life changing almost simultaneously throughout the\\nworld._--scarcely any palг¦ontological discovery is more striking than the\\nfact, that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the\\nworld. thus our european chalk formation can be recognised in many distant\\nparts of the world, under the most different climates, where not a fragment\\nof the mineral chalk itself can be found; namely, in north {323} america,\\nin equatorial south america, in tierra del fuego, at the cape of good hope,\\nand in the peninsula of india. for at these distant points, the organic\\nremains in certain beds present an unmistakeable degree of resemblance to\\nthose of the chalk. it is not that the same species are met with; for in\\nsome cases not one species is identically the same, but they belong to the\\nsame families, genera, and sections of genera, and sometimes are similarly\\ncharacterised in such trifling points as mere superficial sculpture.\\nmoreover other forms, which are not found in the chalk of europe, but which\\noccur in the formations either above or below, are similarly absent at\\nthese distant points of the world. in the several successive palг¦ozoic\\nformations of russia, western europe and north america, a similar\\nparallelism in the forms of life has been observed by several authors: so\\nit is, according to lyell, with the several european and north american\\ntertiary deposits. even if the few fossil species which are common to the\\nold and new worlds be kept wholly out of view, the general parallelism in\\nthe successive forms of life, in the stages of the widely separated\\npalг¦ozoic and tertiary periods, would still be manifest, and the several\\nformations could be easily correlated.\\n\\nthese observations, however, relate to the marine inhabitants of distant\\nparts of the world: we have not sufficient data to judge whether the\\nproductions of the land and of fresh water change at distant points in the\\nsame parallel manner. we may doubt whether they have thus changed: if the\\nmegatherium, mylodon, macrauchenia, and toxodon had been brought to europe\\nfrom la plata, without any information in regard to their geological\\nposition, no one would have suspected that they had co-existed with still\\nliving sea-shells; but as these anomalous monsters co-existed with the\\n{324} mastodon and horse, it might at least have been inferred that they\\nhad lived during one of the later tertiary stages.\\n\\nwhen the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed\\nsimultaneously throughout the world, it must not be supposed that this\\nexpression relates to the same thousandth or hundred-thousandth year, or\\neven that it has a very strict geological sense; for if all the marine\\nanimals which live at the present day in europe, and all those that lived\\nin europe during the pleistocene period (an enormously remote period as\\nmeasured by years, including the whole glacial epoch), were to be compared\\nwith those now living in south america or in australia, the most skilful\\nnaturalist would hardly be able to say whether the existing or the\\npleistocene inhabitants of europe resembled most closely those of the\\nsouthern hemisphere. so, again, several highly competent observers believe\\nthat the existing productions of the united states are more closely related\\nto those which lived in europe during certain later tertiary stages, than\\nto those which now live here; and if this be so, it is evident that\\nfossiliferous beds deposited at the present day on the shores of north\\namerica would hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older\\neuropean beds. nevertheless, looking to a remotely future epoch, there can,\\ni think, be little doubt that all the more modern _marine_ formations,\\nnamely, the upper pliocene, the pleistocene and strictly modern beds, of\\neurope, north and south america, and australia, from containing fossil\\nremains in some degree allied, and from not including those forms which are\\nonly found in the older underlying deposits, would be correctly ranked as\\nsimultaneous in a geological sense.\\n\\nthe fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously, in the above large\\nsense, at distant parts of the world, has greatly struck those admirable\\nobservers, mm. {325} de verneuil and d\\'archiac. after referring to the\\nparallelism of the palг¦ozoic forms of life in various parts of europe, they\\nadd, \"if struck by this strange sequence, we turn our attention to north\\namerica, and there discover a series of analogous phenomena, it will appear\\ncertain that all these modifications of species, their extinction, and the\\nintroduction of new ones, cannot be owing to mere changes in marine\\ncurrents or other causes more or less local and temporary, but depend on\\ngeneral laws which govern the whole animal kingdom.\" m. barrande has made\\nforcible remarks to precisely the same effect. it is, indeed, quite futile\\nto look to changes of currents, climate, or other physical conditions, as\\nthe cause of these great mutations in the forms of life throughout the\\nworld, under the most different climates. we must, as barrande has\\nremarked, look to some special law. we shall see this more clearly when we\\ntreat of the present distribution of organic beings, and find how slight is\\nthe relation between the physical conditions of various countries, and the\\nnature of their inhabitants.\\n\\nthis great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life throughout\\nthe world, is explicable on the theory of natural selection. new species\\nare formed by new varieties arising, which have some advantage over older\\nforms; and those forms, which are already dominant, or have some advantage\\nover the other forms in their own country, would naturally oftenest give\\nrise to new varieties or incipient species; for these latter must be\\nvictorious in a still higher degree in order to be preserved and to\\nsurvive. we have distinct evidence on this head, in the plants which are\\ndominant, that is, which are commonest in their own homes, and are most\\nwidely diffused, having produced the greatest number of new varieties. it\\nis also natural that the {326} dominant, varying, and far-spreading\\nspecies, which already have invaded to a certain extent the territories of\\nother species, should be those which would have the best chance of\\nspreading still further, and of giving rise in new countries to new\\nvarieties and species. the process of diffusion may often be very slow,\\nbeing dependent on climatal and geographical changes, or on strange\\naccidents, but in the long run the dominant forms will generally succeed in\\nspreading. the diffusion would, it is probable, be slower with the\\nterrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than with the marine\\ninhabitants of the continuous sea. we might therefore expect to find, as we\\napparently do find, a less strict degree of parallel succession in the\\nproductions of the land than of the sea.\\n\\ndominant species spreading from any region might encounter still more\\ndominant species, and then their triumphant course, or even their\\nexistence, would cease. we know not at all precisely what are all the\\nconditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominant\\nspecies; but we can, i think, clearly see that a number of individuals,\\nfrom giving a better chance of the appearance of favourable variations, and\\nthat severe competition with many already existing forms, would be highly\\nfavourable, as would be the power of spreading into new territories. a\\ncertain amount of isolation, recurring at long intervals of time, would\\nprobably be also favourable, as before explained. one quarter of the world\\nmay have been most favourable for the production of new and dominant\\nspecies on the land, and another for those in the waters of the sea. if two\\ngreat regions had been for a long period favourably circumstanced in an\\nequal degree, whenever their inhabitants met, the battle would be prolonged\\nand severe; and some from one birthplace and some from the other might be\\nvictorious. but in the course of time, the {327} forms dominant in the\\nhighest degree, wherever produced, would tend everywhere to prevail. as\\nthey prevailed, they would cause the extinction of other and inferior\\nforms; and as these inferior forms would be allied in groups by\\ninheritance, whole groups would tend slowly to disappear; though here and\\nthere a single member might long be enabled to survive.\\n\\nthus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense,\\nsimultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout the world,\\naccords well with the principle of new species having been formed by\\ndominant species spreading widely and varying; the new species thus\\nproduced being themselves dominant owing to inheritance, and to having\\nalready had some advantage over their parents or over other species; these\\nagain spreading, varying, and producing new species. the forms which are\\nbeaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious forms, will\\ngenerally be allied in groups, from inheriting some inferiority in common;\\nand therefore as new and improved groups spread throughout the world, old\\ngroups will disappear from the world; and the succession of forms in both\\nways will everywhere tend to correspond.\\n\\nthere is one other remark connected with this subject worth making. i have\\ngiven my reasons for believing that all our greater fossiliferous\\nformations were deposited during periods of subsidence; and that blank\\nintervals of vast duration occurred during the periods when the bed of the\\nsea was either stationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was not\\nthrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains. during\\nthese long and blank intervals i suppose that the inhabitants of each\\nregion underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction, and\\nthat there was much migration from {328} other parts of the world. as we\\nhave reason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement,\\nit is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been\\naccumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world; but we\\nare far from having any right to conclude that this has invariably been the\\ncase, and that large areas have invariably been affected by the same\\nmovements. when two formations have been deposited in two regions during\\nnearly, but not exactly the same period, we should find in both, from the\\ncauses explained in the foregoing paragraphs, the same general succession\\nin the forms of life; but the species would not exactly correspond; for\\nthere will have been a little more time in the one region than in the other\\nfor modification, extinction, and immigration.\\n\\ni suspect that cases of this nature occur in europe. mr. prestwich, in his\\nadmirable memoirs on the eocene deposits of england and france, is able to\\ndraw a close general parallelism between the successive stages in the two\\ncountries; but when he compares certain stages in england with those in\\nfrance, although he finds in both a curious accordance in the numbers of\\nthe species belonging to the same genera, yet the species themselves differ\\nin a manner very difficult to account for, considering the proximity of the\\ntwo areas,--unless, indeed, it be assumed that an isthmus separated two\\nseas inhabited by distinct, but contemporaneous, faunas. lyell has made\\nsimilar observations on some of the later tertiary formations. barrande,\\nalso, shows that there is a striking general parallelism in the successive\\nsilurian deposits of bohemia and scandinavia; nevertheless he finds a\\nsurprising amount of difference in the species. if the several formations\\nin these regions have not been deposited during the same exact {329}\\nperiods,--a formation in one region often corresponding with a blank\\ninterval in the other,--and if in both regions the species have gone on\\nslowly changing during the accumulation of the several formations and\\nduring the long intervals of time between them; in this case, the several\\nformations in the two regions could be arranged in the same order, in\\naccordance with the general succession of the form of life, and the order\\nwould falsely appear to be strictly parallel; nevertheless the species\\nwould not all be the same in the apparently corresponding stages in the two\\nregions.\\n\\n\\n\\n_on the affinities of extinct species to each other, and to living\\nforms._--let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living\\nspecies. they all fall into one grand natural system; and this fact is at\\nonce explained on the principle of descent. the more ancient any form is,\\nthe more, as a general rule, it differs from living forms. but, as buckland\\nlong ago remarked, all fossils can be classed either in still existing\\ngroups, or between them. that the extinct forms of life help to fill up the\\nwide intervals between existing genera, families, and orders, cannot be\\ndisputed. for if we confine our attention either to the living or to the\\nextinct alone, the series is far less perfect than if we combine both into\\none general system. with respect to the vertebrata, whole pages could be\\nfilled with striking illustrations from our great palaeontologist, owen,\\nshowing how extinct animals fall in between existing groups. cuvier ranked\\nthe ruminants and pachyderms, as the two most distinct orders of mammals;\\nbut owen has discovered so many fossil links, that he has had to alter the\\nwhole classification of these two orders; and has placed certain pachyderms\\nin the same sub-order with ruminants: for example, he dissolves by fine\\ngradations the apparently {330} wide difference between the pig and the\\ncamel. in regard to the invertebrata, barrande, and a higher authority\\ncould not be named, asserts that he is every day taught that palaeozoic\\nanimals, though belonging to the same orders, families, or genera with\\nthose living at the present day, were not at this early epoch limited in\\nsuch distinct groups as they now are.\\n\\nsome writers have objected to any extinct species or group of species being\\nconsidered as intermediate between living species or groups. if by this\\nterm it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate in all its\\ncharacters between two living forms, the objection is probably valid. but i\\napprehend that in a perfectly natural classification many fossil species\\nwould have to stand between living species, and some extinct genera between\\nliving genera, even between genera belonging to distinct families. the most\\ncommon case, especially with respect to very distinct groups, such as fish\\nand reptiles, seems to be, that supposing them to be distinguished at the\\npresent day from each other by a dozen characters, the ancient members of\\nthe same two groups would be distinguished by a somewhat lesser number of\\ncharacters, so that the two groups, though formerly quite distinct, at that\\nperiod made some small approach to each other.\\n\\nit is a common belief that the more ancient a form is, by so much the more\\nit tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely separated\\nfrom each other. this remark no doubt must be restricted to those groups\\nwhich have undergone much change in the course of geological ages; and it\\nwould be difficult to prove the truth of the proposition, for every now and\\nthen even a living animal, as the lepidosiren, is discovered having\\naffinities directed towards very distinct groups. yet if we compare the\\nolder reptiles and {331} batrachians, the older fish, the older\\ncephalopods, and the eocene mammals, with the more recent members of the\\nsame classes, we must admit that there is some truth in the remark.\\n\\nlet us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the\\ntheory of descent with modification. as the subject is somewhat complex, i\\nmust request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter. we\\nmay suppose that the numbered letters represent genera, and the dotted\\nlines diverging from them the species in each genus. the diagram is much\\ntoo simple, too few genera and too few species being given, but this is\\nunimportant for us. the horizontal lines may represent successive\\ngeological formations, and all the forms beneath the uppermost line may be\\nconsidered as extinct. the three existing genera, a^{14}, q^{14}, p^{14},\\nwill form a small family; b^{14} and f^{14} a closely allied family or\\nsub-family; and o^{14}, e^{14}, m^{14}, a third family. these three\\nfamilies, together with the many extinct genera on the several lines of\\ndescent diverging from the parent-form (a), will form an order; for all\\nwill have inherited something in common from their ancient and common\\nprogenitor. on the principle of the continued tendency to divergence of\\ncharacter, which was formerly illustrated by this diagram, the more recent\\nany form is, the more it will generally differ from its ancient progenitor.\\nhence we can understand the rule that the most ancient fossils differ most\\nfrom existing forms. we must not, however, assume that divergence of\\ncharacter is a necessary contingency; it depends solely on the descendants\\nfrom a species being thus enabled to seize on many and different places in\\nthe economy of nature. therefore it is quite possible, as we have seen in\\nthe case of some silurian forms, that a species might go on being slightly\\nmodified in relation to its slightly altered conditions of {332} life, and\\nyet retain throughout a vast period the same general characteristics. this\\nis represented in the diagram by the letter f^{14}.\\n\\nall the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from (a), make, as before\\nremarked, one order; and this order, from the continued effects of\\nextinction and divergence of character, has become divided into several\\nsub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have perished at\\ndifferent periods, and some to have endured to the present day.\\n\\nby looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms,\\nsupposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were discovered at\\nseveral points low down in the series, the three existing families on the\\nuppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other. if, for\\ninstance, the genera a^1, a^5, a^{10}, f^8, m^3, m^6, m^9, were\\ndisinterred, these three families would be so closely linked together that\\nthey probably would have to be united into one great family, in nearly the\\nsame manner as has occurred with ruminants and pachyderms. yet he who\\nobjected to call the extinct genera, which thus linked the living genera of\\nthree families together, intermediate in character, would be justified, as\\nthey are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long and circuitous\\ncourse through many widely different forms. if many extinct forms were to\\nbe discovered above one of the middle horizontal lines or geological\\nformations --for instance, above no. vi.--but none from beneath this line,\\nthen only the two families on the left hand (namely, a^{14}, &c, and\\nb^{14},&c.) would have to be united into one family; and the two other\\nfamilies (namely, a^{14} to f^{14} now including five genera, and o^{14} to\\nm^{14}) would yet remain distinct. these two families, however, would be\\nless distinct from each other than they were before the discovery of the\\nfossils. if, for instance, we suppose the existing genera of the two\\nfamilies to differ from each {333} other by a dozen characters, in this\\ncase the genera, at the early period marked vi., would differ by a lesser\\nnumber of characters; for at this early stage of descent they have not\\ndiverged in character from the common progenitor of the order, nearly so\\nmuch as they subsequently diverged. thus it comes that ancient and extinct\\ngenera are often in some slight degree intermediate in character between\\ntheir modified descendants, or between their collateral relations.\\n\\nin nature the case will be far more complicated than is represented in the\\ndiagram; for the groups will have been more numerous, they will have\\nendured for extremely unequal lengths of time, and will have been modified\\nin various degrees. as we possess only the last volume of the geological\\nrecord, and that in a very broken condition, we have no right to expect,\\nexcept in very rare cases, to fill up wide intervals in the natural system,\\nand thus unite distinct families or orders. all that we have a right to\\nexpect, is that those groups, which have within known geological periods\\nundergone much modification, should in the older formations make some\\nslight approach to each other; so that the older members should differ less\\nfrom each other in some of their characters than do the existing members of\\nthe same groups; and this by the concurrent evidence of our best\\npalг¦ontologists seems frequently to be the case.\\n\\nthus, on the theory of descent with modification, the main facts with\\nrespect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each other\\nand to living forms, seem to me explained in a satisfactory manner. and\\nthey are wholly inexplicable on any other view.\\n\\non this same theory, it is evident that the fauna of any great period in\\nthe earth\\'s history will be intermediate in general character between that\\nwhich preceded and that which succeeded it. thus, the species which lived\\nat the sixth great stage of descent in the {334} diagram are the modified\\noffspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and are the parents of\\nthose which became still more modified at the seventh stage; hence they\\ncould hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character between the forms\\nof life above and below. we must, however, allow for the entire extinction\\nof some preceding forms, and in any one region for the immigration of new\\nforms from other regions, and for a large amount of modification, during\\nthe long and blank intervals between the successive formations. subject to\\nthese allowances, the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is\\nintermediate in character, between the preceding and succeeding faunas. i\\nneed give only one instance, namely, the manner in which the fossils of the\\ndevonian system, when this system was first discovered, were at once\\nrecognised by palг¦ontologists as intermediate in character between those of\\nthe overlying carboniferous, and underlying silurian system. but each fauna\\nis not necessarily exactly intermediate, as unequal intervals of time have\\nelapsed between consecutive formations.\\n\\nit is no real objection to the truth of the statement, that the fauna of\\neach period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the\\npreceding and succeeding faunas, that certain genera offer exceptions to\\nthe rule. for instance, mastodons and elephants, when arranged by dr.\\nfalconer in two series, first according to their mutual affinities and then\\naccording to their periods of existence, do not accord in arrangement. the\\nspecies extreme in character are not the oldest, or the most recent; nor\\nare those which are intermediate in character, intermediate in age. but\\nsupposing for an instant, in this and other such cases, that the record of\\nthe first appearance and disappearance of the species was perfect, we have\\nno reason to believe that forms successively produced necessarily endure\\nfor {335} corresponding lengths of time: a very ancient form might\\noccasionally last much longer than a form elsewhere subsequently produced,\\nespecially in the case of terrestrial productions inhabiting separated\\ndistricts. to compare small things with great: if the principal living and\\nextinct races of the domestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be\\nin serial affinity, this arrangement would not closely accord with the\\norder in time of their production, and still less with the order of their\\ndisappearance; for the parent rock-pigeon now lives; and many varieties\\nbetween the rock-pigeon and the carrier have become extinct; and carriers\\nwhich are extreme in the important character of length of beak originated\\nearlier than short-beaked tumblers, which are at the opposite end of the\\nseries in this same respect.\\n\\nclosely connected with the statement, that the organic remains from an\\nintermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character, is the\\nfact, insisted on by all palг¦ontologists, that fossils from two consecutive\\nformations are far more closely related to each other, than are the fossils\\nfrom two remote formations. pictet gives as a well-known instance, the\\ngeneral resemblance of the organic remains from the several stages of the\\nchalk formation, though the species are distinct in each stage. this fact\\nalone, from its generality, seems to have shaken professor pictet in his\\nfirm belief in the immutability of species. he who is acquainted with the\\ndistribution of existing species over the globe, will not attempt to\\naccount for the close resemblance of the distinct species in closely\\nconsecutive formations, by the physical conditions of the ancient areas\\nhaving remained nearly the same. let it be remembered that the forms of\\nlife, at least those inhabiting the sea, have changed almost simultaneously\\nthroughout the world, and therefore under the most different climates and\\nconditions. consider the {336} prodigious vicissitudes of climate during\\nthe pleistocene period, which includes the whole glacial period, and note\\nhow little the specific forms of the inhabitants of the sea have been\\naffected.\\n\\non the theory of descent, the full meaning of the fact of fossil remains\\nfrom closely consecutive formations, though ranked as distinct species,\\nbeing closely related, is obvious. as the accumulation of each formation\\nhas often been interrupted, and as long blank intervals have intervened\\nbetween successive formations, we ought not to expect to find, as i\\nattempted to show in the last chapter, in any one or two formations all the\\nintermediate varieties between the species which appeared at the\\ncommencement and close of these periods; but we ought to find after\\nintervals, very long as measured by years, but only moderately long as\\nmeasured geologically, closely allied forms, or, as they have been called\\nby some authors, representative species; and these we assuredly do find. we\\nfind, in short, such evidence of the slow and scarcely sensible mutation of\\nspecific forms, as we have a just right to expect to find.\\n\\n\\n\\n_on the state of development of ancient forms._--there has been much\\ndiscussion whether recent forms are more highly developed than ancient. i\\nwill not here enter on this subject, for naturalists have not as yet\\ndefined to each other\\'s satisfaction what is meant by high and low forms.\\nthe best definition probably is, that the higher forms have their organs\\nmore distinctly specialised for different functions; and as such division\\nof physiological labour seems to be an advantage to each being, natural\\nselection will constantly tend in so far to make the later and more\\nmodified forms higher than their early progenitors, or than the slightly\\nmodified descendants of such progenitors. in a more general sense the {337}\\nmore recent forms must, on my theory, be higher than the more ancient; for\\neach new species is formed by having had some advantage in the struggle for\\nlife over other and preceding forms. if under a nearly similar climate, the\\neocene inhabitants of one quarter of the world were put into competition\\nwith the existing inhabitants of the same or some other quarter, the eocene\\nfauna or flora would certainly be beaten and exterminated; as would a\\nsecondary fauna by an eocene, and a palг¦ozoic fauna by a secondary fauna. i\\ndo not doubt that this process of improvement has affected in a marked and\\nsensible manner the organisation of the more recent and victorious forms of\\nlife, in comparison with the ancient and beaten forms; but i can see no way\\nof testing this sort of progress. crustaceans, for instance, not the\\nhighest in their own class, may have beaten the highest molluscs. from the\\nextraordinary manner in which european productions have recently spread\\nover new zealand, and have seized on places which must have been previously\\noccupied, we may believe, if all the animals and plants of great britain\\nwere set free in new zealand, that in the course of time a multitude of\\nbritish forms would become thoroughly naturalized there, and would\\nexterminate many of the natives. on the other hand, from what we see now\\noccurring in new zealand, and from hardly a single inhabitant of the\\nsouthern hemisphere having become wild in any part of europe, we may doubt,\\nif all the productions of new zealand were set free in great britain,\\nwhether any considerable number would be enabled to seize on places now\\noccupied by our native plants and animals. under this point of view, the\\nproductions of great britain may be said to be higher than those of new\\nzealand. yet the most skilful naturalist from an examination of the {338}\\nspecies of the two countries could not have foreseen this result.\\n\\nagassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the\\nembryos of recent animals of the same classes; or that the geological\\nsuccession of extinct forms is in some degree parallel to the embryological\\ndevelopment of recent forms. i must follow pictet and huxley in thinking\\nthat the truth of this doctrine is very far from proved. yet i fully expect\\nto see it hereafter confirmed, at least in regard to subordinate groups,\\nwhich have branched off from each other within comparatively recent times.\\nfor this doctrine of agassiz accords well with the theory of natural\\nselection. in a future chapter i shall attempt to show that the adult\\ndiffers from its embryo, owing to variations supervening at a not early\\nage, and being inherited at a corresponding age. this process, whilst it\\nleaves the embryo almost unaltered, continually adds, in the course of\\nsuccessive generations, more and more difference to the adult.\\n\\nthus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture, preserved by nature,\\nof the ancient and less modified condition of each animal. this view may be\\ntrue, and yet it may never be capable of full proof. seeing, for instance,\\nthat the oldest known mammals, reptiles, and fish strictly belong to their\\nown proper classes, though some of these old forms are in a slight degree\\nless distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same\\ngroups at the present day, it would be vain to look for animals having the\\ncommon embryological character of the vertebrata, until beds far beneath\\nthe lowest silurian strata are discovered--a discovery of which the chance\\nis very small.\\n\\n\\n\\n_on the succession of the same types within the same {339} areas, during\\nthe later tertiary periods._--mr. clift many years ago showed that the\\nfossil mammals from the australian caves were closely allied to the living\\nmarsupials of that continent. in south america, a similar relationship is\\nmanifest, even to an uneducated eye, in the gigantic pieces of armour like\\nthose of the armadillo, found in several parts of la plata; and professor\\nowen has shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals,\\nburied there in such numbers, are related to south american types. this\\nrelationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of\\nfossil bones made by mm. lund and clausen in the caves of brazil. i was so\\nmuch impressed with these facts that i strongly insisted, in 1839 and 1845,\\non this \"law of the succession of types,\"--on \"this wonderful relationship\\nin the same continent between the dead and the living.\" professor owen has\\nsubsequently extended the same generalisation to the mammals of the old\\nworld. we see the same law in this author\\'s restorations of the extinct and\\ngigantic birds of new zealand. we see it also in the birds of the caves of\\nbrazil. mr. woodward has shown that the same law holds good with\\nsea-shells, but from the wide distribution of most genera of molluscs, it\\nis not well displayed by them. other cases could be added, as the relation\\nbetween the extinct and living land-shells of madeira; and between the\\nextinct and living brackish-water shells of the aralo-caspian sea.\\n\\nnow what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types\\nwithin the same areas mean? he would be a bold man, who after comparing the\\npresent climate of australia and of parts of south america under the same\\nlatitude, would attempt to account, on the one hand, by dissimilar physical\\nconditions for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of these two\\ncontinents, {340} and, on the other hand, by similarity of conditions, for\\nthe uniformity of the same types in each during the later tertiary periods.\\nnor can it be pretended that it is an immutable law that marsupials should\\nhave been chiefly or solely produced in australia; or that edentata and\\nother american types should have been solely produced in south america. for\\nwe know that europe in ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials;\\nand i have shown in the publications above alluded to, that in america the\\nlaw of distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what\\nit now is. north america formerly partook strongly of the present character\\nof the southern half of the continent; and the southern half was formerly\\nmore closely allied, than it is at present, to the northern half. in a\\nsimilar manner we know from falconer and cautley\\'s discoveries, that\\nnorthern india was formerly more closely related in its mammals to africa\\nthan it is at the present time. analogous facts could be given in relation\\nto the distribution of marine animals.\\n\\non the theory of descent with modification, the great law of the long\\nenduring, but not immutable, succession of the same types within the same\\nareas, is at once explained; for the inhabitants of each quarter of the\\nworld will obviously tend to leave in that quarter, during the next\\nsucceeding period of time, closely allied though in some degree modified\\ndescendants. if the inhabitants of one continent formerly differed greatly\\nfrom those of another continent, so will their modified descendants still\\ndiffer in nearly the same manner and degree. but after very long intervals\\nof time and after great geographical changes, permitting much\\ninter-migration, the feebler will yield to the more dominant forms, and\\nthere will be nothing immutable in the laws of past and present\\ndistribution. {341}\\n\\nit may be asked in ridicule, whether i suppose that the megatherium and\\nother allied huge monsters have left behind them in south america, the\\nsloth, armadillo, and anteater, as their degenerate descendants. this\\ncannot for an instant be admitted. these huge animals have become wholly\\nextinct, and have left no progeny. but in the caves of brazil, there are\\nmany extinct species which are closely allied in size and in other\\ncharacters to the species still living in south america; and some of these\\nfossils may be the actual progenitors of living species. it must not be\\nforgotten that, on my theory, all the species of the same genus have\\ndescended from some one species; so that if six genera, each having eight\\nspecies, be found in one geological formation, and in the next succeeding\\nformation there be six other allied or representative genera with the same\\nnumber of species, then we may conclude that only one species of each of\\nthe six older genera has left modified descendants, constituting the six\\nnew genera. the other seven species of the old genera have all died out and\\nhave left no progeny. or, which would probably be a far commoner case, two\\nor three species of two or three alone of the six older genera will have\\nbeen the parents of the six new genera; the other old species and the other\\nwhole old genera having become utterly extinct. in failing orders, with the\\ngenera and species decreasing in numbers, as apparently is the case of the\\nedentata of south america, still fewer genera and species will have left\\nmodified blood-descendants.\\n\\n\\n\\n_summary of the preceding and present chapters._--i have attempted to show\\nthat the geological record is extremely imperfect; that only a small\\nportion of the globe has been geologically explored with care; that {342}\\nonly certain classes of organic beings have been largely preserved in a\\nfossil state; that the number both of specimens and of species, preserved\\nin our museums, is absolutely as nothing compared with the incalculable\\nnumber of generations which must have passed away even during a single\\nformation; that, owing to subsidence being necessary for the accumulation\\nof fossiliferous deposits thick enough to resist future degradation,\\nenormous intervals of time have elapsed between the successive formations;\\nthat there has probably been more extinction during the periods of\\nsubsidence, and more variation during the periods of elevation, and during\\nthe latter the record will have been least perfectly kept; that each single\\nformation has not been continuously deposited; that the duration of each\\nformation is, perhaps, short compared with the average duration of specific\\nforms; that migration has played an important part in the first appearance\\nof new forms in any one area and formation; that widely ranging species are\\nthose which have varied most, and have oftenest given rise to new species;\\nand that varieties have at first often been local. all these causes taken\\nconjointly, must have tended to make the geological record extremely\\nimperfect, and will to a large extent explain why we do not find\\ninterminable varieties, connecting together all the extinct and existing\\nforms of life by the finest graduated steps.\\n\\nhe who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record, will\\nrightly reject my whole theory. for he may ask in vain where are the\\nnumberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the\\nclosely allied or representative species, found in the several stages of\\nthe same great formation. he may disbelieve in the enormous intervals of\\ntime which have elapsed between our consecutive formations; he {343} may\\noverlook how important a part migration must have played, when the\\nformations of any one great region alone, as that of europe, are\\nconsidered; he may urge the apparent, but often falsely apparent, sudden\\ncoming in of whole groups of species. he may ask where are the remains of\\nthose infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the\\nfirst bed of the silurian system was deposited: i can answer this latter\\nquestion only hypothetically, by saying that as far as we can see, where\\nour oceans now extend they have for an enormous period extended, and where\\nour oscillating continents now stand they have stood ever since the\\nsilurian epoch; but that long before that period, the world may have\\npresented a wholly different aspect; and that the older continents, formed\\nof formations older than any known to us, may now all be in a metamorphosed\\ncondition, or may lie buried under the ocean.\\n\\npassing from these difficulties, all the other great leading facts in\\npalг¦ontology seem to me simply to follow on the theory of descent with\\nmodification through natural selection. we can thus understand how it is\\nthat new species come in slowly and successively; how species of different\\nclasses do not necessarily change together, or at the same rate, or in the\\nsame degree; yet in the long run that all undergo modification to some\\nextent. the extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of\\nthe production of new forms. we can understand why when a species has once\\ndisappeared it never reappears. groups of species increase in numbers\\nslowly, and endure for unequal periods of time; for the process of\\nmodification is necessarily slow, and depends on many complex\\ncontingencies. the dominant species of the larger dominant groups tend to\\nleave many modified {344} descendants, and thus new sub-groups and groups\\nare formed. as these are formed, the species of the less vigorous groups,\\nfrom their inferiority inherited from a common progenitor, tend to become\\nextinct together, and to leave no modified offspring on the face of the\\nearth. but the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a\\nvery slow process, from the survival of a few descendants, lingering in\\nprotected and isolated situations. when a group has once wholly\\ndisappeared, it does not reappear; for the link of generation has been\\nbroken.\\n\\nwe can understand how the spreading of the dominant forms of life, which\\nare those that oftenest vary, will in the long run tend to people the world\\nwith allied, but modified, descendants; and these will generally succeed in\\ntaking the places of those groups of species which are their inferiors in\\nthe struggle for existence. hence, after long intervals of time, the\\nproductions of the world will appear to have changed simultaneously.\\n\\nwe can understand how it is that all the forms of life, ancient and recent,\\nmake together one grand system; for all are connected by generation. we can\\nunderstand, from the continued tendency to divergence of character, why the\\nmore ancient a form is, the more it generally differs from those now\\nliving. why ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between\\nexisting forms, sometimes blending two groups previously classed as\\ndistinct into one; but more commonly only bringing them a little closer\\ntogether. the more ancient a form is, the more often, apparently, it\\ndisplays characters in some degree intermediate between groups now\\ndistinct; for the more ancient a form is, the more nearly it will be\\nrelated to, and consequently resemble, the common progenitor of groups,\\nsince {345} become widely divergent. extinct forms are seldom directly\\nintermediate between existing forms; but are intermediate only by a long\\nand circuitous course through many extinct and very different forms. we can\\nclearly see why the organic remains of closely consecutive formations are\\nmore closely allied to each other, than are those of remote formations; for\\nthe forms are more closely linked together by generation: we can clearly\\nsee why the remains of an intermediate formation are intermediate in\\ncharacter.\\n\\nthe inhabitants of each successive period in the world\\'s history have\\nbeaten their predecessors in the race for life, and are, in so far, higher\\nin the scale of nature; and this may account for that vague yet ill-defined\\nsentiment, felt by many palг¦ontologists, that organisation on the whole has\\nprogressed. if it should hereafter be proved that ancient animals resemble\\nto a certain extent the embryos of more recent animals of the same class,\\nthe fact will be intelligible. the succession of the same types of\\nstructure within the same areas during the later geological periods ceases\\nto be mysterious, and is simply explained by inheritance.\\n\\nif then the geological record be as imperfect as i believe it to be, and it\\nmay at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much more\\nperfect, the main objections to the theory of natural selection are greatly\\ndiminished or disappear. on the other hand, all the chief laws of\\npalг¦ontology plainly proclaim, as it seems to me, that species have been\\nproduced by ordinary generation: old forms having been supplanted by new\\nand improved forms of life, produced by the laws of variation still acting\\nround us, and preserved by natural selection.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{346}\\n\\nchapter xi.\\n\\ngeographical distribution.\\n\\n    present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical\\n    conditions--importance of barriers--affinity of the productions of the\\n    same continent--centres of creation--means of dispersal, by changes of\\n    climate and of the level of the land, and by occasional\\n    means--dispersal during the glacial period co-extensive with the world.\\n\\nin considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of the\\nglobe, the first great fact which strikes us is, that neither the\\nsimilarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions can\\nbe accounted for by their climatal and other physical conditions. of late,\\nalmost every author who has studied the subject has come to this\\nconclusion. the case of america alone would almost suffice to prove its\\ntruth: for if we exclude the northern parts where the circumpolar land is\\nalmost continuous, all authors agree that one of the most fundamental\\ndivisions in geographical distribution is that between the new and old\\nworlds; yet if we travel over the vast american continent, from the central\\nparts of the united states to its extreme southern point, we meet with the\\nmost diversified conditions; the most humid districts, arid deserts, lofty\\nmountains, grassy plains, forests, marshes, lakes, and great rivers, under\\nalmost every temperature. there is hardly a climate or condition in the old\\nworld which cannot be paralleled in the new--at least as closely as the\\nsame species generally require; for it is a most rare case to find a group\\nof organisms confined to any small spot, having conditions peculiar in only\\na slight {347} degree; for instance, small areas in the old world could be\\npointed out hotter than any in the new world, yet these are not inhabited\\nby a peculiar fauna or flora. notwithstanding this parallelism in the\\nconditions of the old and new worlds, how widely different are their living\\nproductions!\\n\\nin the southern hemisphere, if we compare large tracts of land in\\naustralia, south africa, and western south america, between latitudes 25в°\\nand 35в°, we shall find parts extremely similar in all their conditions, yet\\nit would not be possible to point out three faunas and floras more utterly\\ndissimilar. or again we may compare the productions of south america south\\nof lat. 35в° with those north of 25в°, which consequently inhabit a\\nconsiderably different climate, and they will be found incomparably more\\nclosely related to each other, than they are to the productions of\\naustralia or africa under nearly the same climate. analogous facts could be\\ngiven with respect to the inhabitants of the sea.\\n\\na second great fact which strikes us in our general review is, that\\nbarriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a\\nclose and important manner to the differences between the productions of\\nvarious regions. we see this in the great difference of nearly all the\\nterrestrial productions of the new and old worlds, excepting in the\\nnorthern parts, where the land almost joins, and where, under a slightly\\ndifferent climate, there might have been free migration for the northern\\ntemperate forms, as there now is for the strictly arctic productions. we\\nsee the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants of\\naustralia, africa, and south america under the same latitude: for these\\ncountries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible. on\\neach continent, also, we see the same fact; for on the opposite sides of\\n{348} lofty and continuous mountain-ranges, and of great deserts, and\\nsometimes even of large rivers, we find different productions; though as\\nmountain-chains, deserts, &c., are not as impassable, or likely to have\\nendured so long as the oceans separating continents, the differences are\\nvery inferior in degree to those characteristic of distinct continents.\\n\\nturning to the sea, we find the same law. no two marine faunas are more\\ndistinct, with hardly a fish, shell, or crab in common, than those of the\\neastern and western shores of south and central america; yet these great\\nfaunas are separated only by the narrow, but impassable, isthmus of panama.\\nwestward of the shores of america, a wide space of open ocean extends, with\\nnot an island as a halting-place for emigrants; here we have a barrier of\\nanother kind, and as soon as this is passed we meet in the eastern islands\\nof the pacific, with another and totally distinct fauna. so that here three\\nmarine faunas range far northward and southward, in parallel lines not far\\nfrom each other, under corresponding climates; but from being separated\\nfrom each other by impassable barriers, either of land or open sea, they\\nare wholly distinct. on the other hand, proceeding still further westward\\nfrom the eastern islands of the tropical parts of the pacific, we encounter\\nno impassable barriers, and we have innumerable islands as halting-places,\\nor continuous coasts, until after travelling over a hemisphere we come to\\nthe shores of africa; and over this vast space we meet with no well-defined\\nand distinct marine faunas. although hardly one shell, crab or fish is\\ncommon to the above-named three approximate faunas of eastern and western\\namerica and the eastern pacific islands, yet many fish range from the\\npacific into the indian ocean, and many shells are common to the eastern\\nislands of the pacific {349} and the eastern shores of africa, on almost\\nexactly opposite meridians of longitude.\\n\\na third great fact, partly included in the foregoing statements, is the\\naffinity of the productions of the same continent or sea, though the\\nspecies themselves are distinct at different points and stations. it is a\\nlaw of the widest generality, and every continent offers innumerable\\ninstances. nevertheless the naturalist in travelling, for instance, from\\nnorth to south never fails to be struck by the manner in which successive\\ngroups of beings, specifically distinct, yet clearly related, replace each\\nother. he hears from closely allied, yet distinct kinds of birds, notes\\nnearly similar, and sees their nests similarly constructed, but not quite\\nalike, with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner. the plains near the\\nstraits of magellan are inhabited by one species of rhea (american\\nostrich), and northward the plains of la plata by another species of the\\nsame genus; and not by a true ostrich or emu, like those found in africa\\nand australia under the same latitude. on these same plains of la plata, we\\nsee the agouti and bizcacha, animals having nearly the same habits as our\\nhares and rabbits and belonging to the same order of rodents, but they\\nplainly display an american type of structure. we ascend the lofty peaks of\\nthe cordillera and we find an alpine species of bizcacha; we look to the\\nwaters, and we do not find the beaver or musk-rat, but the coypu and\\ncapybara, rodents of the american type. innumerable other instances could\\nbe given. if we look to the islands off the american shore, however much\\nthey may differ in geological structure, the inhabitants, though they may\\nbe all peculiar species, are essentially american. we may look back to past\\nages, as shown in the last chapter, and we find american types then\\nprevalent on {350} the american continent and in the american seas. we see\\nin these facts some deep organic bond, prevailing throughout space and\\ntime, over the same areas of land and water, and independent of their\\nphysical conditions. the naturalist must feel little curiosity, who is not\\nled to inquire what this bond is.\\n\\nthis bond, on my theory, is simply inheritance, that cause which alone, as\\nfar as we positively know, produces organisms quite like, or, as we see in\\nthe case of varieties, nearly like each other. the dissimilarity of the\\ninhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification through\\nnatural selection, and in a quite subordinate degree to the direct\\ninfluence of different physical conditions. the degree of dissimilarity\\nwill depend on the migration of the more dominant forms of life from one\\nregion into another having been effected with more or less ease, at periods\\nmore or less remote;--on the nature and number of the former\\nimmigrants;--and on their action and reaction, in their mutual struggles\\nfor life;--the relation of organism to organism being, as i have already\\noften remarked, the most important of all relations. thus the high\\nimportance of barriers comes into play by checking migration; as does time\\nfor the slow process of modification through natural selection.\\nwidely-ranging species, abounding in individuals, which have already\\ntriumphed over many competitors in their own widely-extended homes will\\nhave the best chance of seizing on new places, when they spread into new\\ncountries. in their new homes they will be exposed to new conditions, and\\nwill frequently undergo further modification and improvement; and thus they\\nwill become still further victorious, and will produce groups of modified\\ndescendants. on this principle of inheritance with modification, we can\\nunderstand how it is that sections of genera, whole genera, {351} and even\\nfamilies are confined to the same areas, as is so commonly and notoriously\\nthe case.\\n\\ni believe, as was remarked in the last chapter, in no law of necessary\\ndevelopment. as the variability of each species is an independent property,\\nand will be taken advantage of by natural selection, only so far as it\\nprofits the individual in its complex struggle for life, so the degree of\\nmodification in different species will be no uniform quantity. if, for\\ninstance, a number of species, which stand in direct competition with each\\nother, migrate in a body into a new and afterwards isolated country, they\\nwill be little liable to modification; for neither migration nor isolation\\nin themselves can do anything. these principles come into play only by\\nbringing organisms into new relations with each other, and in a lesser\\ndegree with the surrounding physical conditions. as we have seen in the\\nlast chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character from\\nan enormously remote geological period, so certain species have migrated\\nover vast spaces, and have not become greatly modified.\\n\\non these views, it is obvious, that the several species of the same genus,\\nthough inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world, must originally\\nhave proceeded from the same source, as they have descended from the same\\nprogenitor. in the case of those species, which have undergone during whole\\ngeological periods but little modification, there is not much difficulty in\\nbelieving that they may have migrated from the same region; for during the\\nvast geographical and climatal changes which will have supervened since\\nancient times, almost any amount of migration is possible. but in many\\nother cases, in which we have reason to believe that the species of a genus\\nhave been produced within comparatively recent times, there is great\\ndifficulty on this head. it {352} is also obvious that the individuals of\\nthe same species, though now inhabiting distant and isolated regions, must\\nhave proceeded from one spot, where their parents were first produced: for,\\nas explained in the last chapter, it is incredible that individuals\\nidentically the same should ever have been produced through natural\\nselection from parents specifically distinct.\\n\\nwe are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by\\nnaturalists, namely, whether species have been created at one or more\\npoints of the earth\\'s surface. undoubtedly there are very many cases of\\nextreme difficulty, in understanding how the same species could possibly\\nhave migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated\\npoints, where now found. nevertheless the simplicity of the view that each\\nspecies was first produced within a single region captivates the mind. he\\nwho rejects it, rejects the _vera causa_ of ordinary generation with\\nsubsequent migration, and calls in the agency of a miracle. it is\\nuniversally admitted, that in most cases the area inhabited by a species is\\ncontinuous; and when a plant or animal inhabits two points so distant from\\neach other, or with an interval of such a nature, that the space could not\\nbe easily passed over by migration, the fact is given as something\\nremarkable and exceptional. the capacity of migrating across the sea is\\nmore distinctly limited in terrestrial mammals, than perhaps in any other\\norganic beings; and, accordingly, we find no inexplicable cases of the same\\nmammal inhabiting distant points of the world. no geologist will feel any\\ndifficulty in such cases as great britain having been formerly united to\\neurope, and consequently possessing the same quadrupeds. but if the same\\nspecies can be produced at two separate points, why do we not find a single\\nmammal common to europe and {353} australia or south america? the\\nconditions of life are nearly the same, so that a multitude of european\\nanimals and plants have become naturalised in america and australia; and\\nsome of the aboriginal plants are identically the same at these distant\\npoints of the northern and southern hemispheres? the answer, as i believe,\\nis, that mammals have not been able to migrate, whereas some plants, from\\ntheir varied means of dispersal, have migrated across the vast and broken\\ninterspace. the great and striking influence which barriers of every kind\\nhave had on distribution, is intelligible only on the view that the great\\nmajority of species have been produced on one side alone, and have not been\\nable to migrate to the other side. some few families, many sub-families,\\nvery many genera, and a still greater number of sections of genera are\\nconfined to a single region; and it has been observed by several\\nnaturalists, that the most natural genera, or those genera in which the\\nspecies are most closely related to each other, are generally local, or\\nconfined to one area. what a strange anomaly it would be, if, when coming\\none step lower in the series, to the individuals of the same species, a\\ndirectly opposite rule prevailed; and species were not local, but had been\\nproduced in two or more distinct areas!\\n\\nhence it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the view of\\neach species having been produced in one area alone, and having\\nsubsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration and\\nsubsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most\\nprobable. undoubtedly many cases occur, in which we cannot explain how the\\nsame species could have passed from one point to the other. but the\\ngeographical and climatal changes, which have certainly occurred within\\nrecent geological times, must have interrupted or rendered discontinuous\\nthe {354} formerly continuous range of many species. so that we are reduced\\nto consider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous\\nand of so grave a nature, that we ought to give up the belief, rendered\\nprobable by general considerations, that each species has been produced\\nwithin one area, and has migrated thence as far as it could. it would be\\nhopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same\\nspecies, now living at distant and separated points; nor do i for a moment\\npretend that any explanation could be offered of many such cases. but after\\nsome preliminary remarks, i will discuss a few of the most striking classes\\nof facts; namely, the existence of the same species on the summits of\\ndistant mountain-ranges, and at distant points in the arctic and antarctic\\nregions; and secondly (in the following chapter), the wide distribution of\\nfreshwater productions; and thirdly, the occurrence of the same terrestrial\\nspecies on islands and on the mainland, though separated by hundreds of\\nmiles of open sea. if the existence of the same species at distant and\\nisolated points of the earth\\'s surface, can in many instances be explained\\non the view of each species having migrated from a single birthplace; then,\\nconsidering our ignorance with respect to former climatal and geographical\\nchanges and various occasional means of transport, the belief that this has\\nbeen the universal law, seems to me incomparably the safest.\\n\\nin discussing this subject, we shall be enabled at the same time to\\nconsider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the several\\ndistinct species of a genus, which on my theory have all descended from a\\ncommon progenitor, can have migrated (undergoing modification during some\\npart of their migration) from the area inhabited by their progenitor. if it\\ncan be shown to be almost invariably the case, that a region, of which\\n{355} most of its inhabitants are closely related to, or belong to the same\\ngenera with the species of a second region, has probably received at some\\nformer period immigrants from this other region, my theory will be\\nstrengthened; for we can clearly understand, on the principle of\\nmodification, why the inhabitants of a region should be related to those of\\nanother region, whence it has been stocked. a volcanic island, for\\ninstance, upheaved and formed at the distance of a few hundreds of miles\\nfrom a continent, would probably receive from it in the course of time a\\nfew colonists, and their descendants, though modified, would still be\\nplainly related by inheritance to the inhabitants of the continent. cases\\nof this nature are common, and are, as we shall hereafter more fully see,\\ninexplicable on the theory of independent creation. this view of the\\nrelation of species in one region to those in another, does not differ much\\n(by substituting the word variety for species) from that lately advanced in\\nan ingenious paper by mr. wallace, in which he concludes, that \"every\\nspecies has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a\\npre-existing closely allied species.\" and i now know from correspondence,\\nthat this coincidence he attributes to generation with modification.\\n\\nthe previous remarks on \"single and multiple centres of creation\" do not\\ndirectly bear on another allied question,--namely whether all the\\nindividuals of the same species have descended from a single pair, or\\nsingle hermaphrodite, or whether, as some authors suppose, from many\\nindividuals simultaneously created. with those organic beings which never\\nintercross (if such exist), the species, on my theory, must have descended\\nfrom a succession of improved varieties, which will never have blended with\\nother individuals or varieties, but will have supplanted each other; so\\nthat, at each {356} successive stage of modification and improvement, all\\nthe individuals of each variety will have descended from a single parent.\\nbut in the majority of cases, namely, with all organisms which habitually\\nunite for each birth, or which often intercross, i believe that during the\\nslow process of modification the individuals of the species will have been\\nkept nearly uniform by intercrossing; so that many individuals will have\\ngone on simultaneously changing, and the whole amount of modification will\\nnot have been due, at each stage, to descent from a single parent. to\\nillustrate what i mean: our english racehorses differ slightly from the\\nhorses of every other breed; but they do not owe their difference and\\nsuperiority to descent from any single pair, but to continued care in\\nselecting and training many individuals during many generations.\\n\\nbefore discussing the three classes of facts, which i have selected as\\npresenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of \"single\\ncentres of creation,\" i must say a few words on the means of dispersal.\\n\\n\\n\\n_means of dispersal._--sir c. lyell and other authors have ably treated\\nthis subject. i can give here only the briefest abstract of the more\\nimportant facts. change of climate must have had a powerful influence on\\nmigration: a region when its climate was different may have been a high\\nroad for migration, but now be impassable; i shall, however, presently have\\nto discuss this branch of the subject in some detail. changes of level in\\nthe land must also have been highly influential: a narrow isthmus now\\nseparates two marine faunas; submerge it, or let it formerly have been\\nsubmerged, and the two faunas will now blend or may formerly have blended:\\nwhere the sea now extends, land may at a former period have connected\\nislands or {357} possibly even continents together, and thus have allowed\\nterrestrial productions to pass from one to the other. no geologist will\\ndispute that great mutations of level have occurred within the period of\\nexisting organisms. edward forbes insisted that all the islands in the\\natlantic must recently have been connected with europe or africa, and\\neurope likewise with america. other authors have thus hypothetically\\nbridged over every ocean, and have united almost every island to some\\nmainland. if indeed the arguments used by forbes are to be trusted, it must\\nbe admitted that scarcely a single island exists which has not recently\\nbeen united to some continent. this view cuts the gordian knot of the\\ndispersal of the same species to the most distant points, and removes many\\na difficulty: but to the best of my judgment we are not authorized in\\nadmitting such enormous geographical changes within the period of existing\\nspecies. it seems to me that we have abundant evidence of great\\noscillations of level in our continents; but not of such vast changes in\\ntheir position and extension, as to have united them within the recent\\nperiod to each other and to the several intervening oceanic islands. i\\nfreely admit the former existence of many islands, now buried beneath the\\nsea, which may have served as halting places for plants and for many\\nanimals during their migration. in the coral-producing oceans such sunken\\nislands are now marked, as i believe, by rings of coral or atolls standing\\nover them. whenever it is fully admitted, as i believe it will some day be,\\nthat each species has proceeded from a single birthplace, and when in the\\ncourse of time we know something definite about the means of distribution,\\nwe shall be enabled to speculate with security on the former extension of\\nthe land. but i do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the\\n{358} recent period continents which are now quite separate, have been\\ncontinuously, or almost continuously, united with each other, and with the\\nmany existing oceanic islands. several facts in distribution,--such as the\\ngreat difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every\\ncontinent,--the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands\\nand even seas to their present inhabitants,--a certain degree of relation\\n(as we shall hereafter see) between the distribution of mammals and the\\ndepth of the sea,--these and other such facts seem to me opposed to the\\nadmission of such prodigious geographical revolutions within the recent\\nperiod, as are necessitated on the view advanced by forbes and admitted by\\nhis many followers. the nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants\\nof oceanic islands likewise seem to me opposed to the belief of their\\nformer continuity with continents. nor does their almost universally\\nvolcanic composition favour the admission that they are the wrecks of\\nsunken continents;--if they had originally existed as mountain-ranges on\\nthe land, some at least of the islands would have been formed, like other\\nmountain-summits, of granite, metamorphic schists, old fossiliferous or\\nother such rocks, instead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter.\\n\\ni must now say a few words on what are called accidental means, but which\\nmore properly might be called occasional means of distribution. i shall\\nhere confine myself to plants. in botanical works, this or that plant is\\nstated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination; but for transport across\\nthe sea, the greater or less facilities may be said to be almost wholly\\nunknown. until i tried, with mr. berkeley\\'s aid, a few experiments, it was\\nnot even known how far seeds could resist the injurious action of\\nsea-water. to my surprise i found that {359} out of 87 kinds, 64 germinated\\nafter an immersion of 28 days, and a few survived an immersion of 137 days.\\nfor convenience\\' sake i chiefly tried small seeds, without the capsule or\\nfruit; and as all of these sank in a few days, they could not be floated\\nacross wide spaces of the sea, whether or not they were injured by the\\nsalt-water. afterwards i tried some larger fruits, capsules, &c., and some\\nof these floated for a long time. it is well known what a difference there\\nis in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber; and it occurred to me that\\nfloods might wash down plants or branches, and that these might be dried on\\nthe banks, and then by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea.\\nhence i was led to dry stems and branches of 94 plants with ripe fruit, and\\nto place them on sea-water. the majority sank quickly, but some which\\nwhilst green floated for a very short time, when dried floated much longer;\\nfor instance, ripe hazel-nuts sank immediately, but when dried they floated\\nfor 90 days, and afterwards when planted they germinated; an asparagus\\nplant with ripe berries floated for 23 days, when dried it floated for 85\\ndays, and the seeds afterwards germinated; the ripe seeds of helosciadium\\nsank in two days, when dried they floated for above 90 days, and afterwards\\ngerminated. altogether out of the 94 dried plants, 18 floated for above 28\\ndays, and some of the 18 floated for a very much longer period. so that as\\n64/87 seeds germinated after an immersion of 28 days; and as 18/94 plants\\nwith ripe fruit (but not all the same species as in the foregoing\\nexperiment) floated, after being dried, for above 28 days, as far as we may\\ninfer anything from these scanty facts, we may conclude that the seeds of\\n14/100 plants of any country might be floated by sea-currents during 28\\ndays, and would retain their power of germination. in johnston\\'s physical\\natlas, the average {360} rate of the several atlantic currents is 33 miles\\nper diem (some currents running at the rate of 60 miles per diem); on this\\naverage, the seeds of 14/100 plants belonging to one country might be\\nfloated across 924 miles of sea to another country; and when stranded, if\\nblown to a favourable spot by an inland gale, they would germinate.\\n\\nsubsequently to my experiments, m. martens tried similar ones, but in a\\nmuch better manner, for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea, so\\nthat they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really floating\\nplants. he tried 98 seeds, mostly different from mine; but he chose many\\nlarge fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live near the sea; and\\nthis would have favoured the average length of their flotation and of their\\nresistance to the injurious action of the salt-water. on the other hand he\\ndid not previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit; and this, as\\nwe have seen, would have caused some of them to have floated much longer.\\nthe result was that 18/98 of his seeds floated for 42 days, and were then\\ncapable of germination. but i do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves\\nwould float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as\\nin our experiments. therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the\\nseeds of about 10/100 plants of a flora, after having been dried, could be\\nfloated across a space of sea 900 miles in width, and would then germinate.\\nthe fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small, is\\ninteresting; as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be\\ntransported by any other means; and alph. de candolle has shown that such\\nplants generally have restricted ranges.\\n\\nbut seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner. drift timber\\nis thrown up on most islands, {361} even on those in the midst of the\\nwidest oceans; and the natives of the coral-islands in the pacific, procure\\nstones for their tools, solely from the roots of drifted trees, these\\nstones being a valuable royal tax. i find on examination, that when\\nirregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees, small parcels\\nof earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind\\nthem,--so perfectly that not a particle could be washed away in the longest\\ntransport: out of one small portion of earth thus _completely_ enclosed by\\nwood in an oak about 50 years old, three dicotyledonous plants germinated:\\ni am certain of the accuracy of this observation. again, i can show that\\nthe carcasses of birds, when floating on the sea, sometimes escape being\\nimmediately devoured; and seeds of many kinds in the crops of floating\\nbirds long retain their vitality: peas and vetches, for instance, are\\nkilled by even a few days\\' immersion in sea-water; but some taken out of\\nthe crop of a pigeon, which had floated on artificial salt-water for 30\\ndays, to my surprise nearly all germinated.\\n\\nliving birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the\\ntransportation of seeds. i could give many facts showing how frequently\\nbirds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the ocean.\\nwe may i think safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of\\nflight would often be 35 miles an hour; and some authors have given a far\\nhigher estimate. i have never seen an instance of nutritious seeds passing\\nthrough the intestines of a bird; but hard seeds of fruit pass uninjured\\nthrough even the digestive organs of a turkey. in the course of two months,\\ni picked up in my garden 12 kinds of seeds, out of the excrement of small\\nbirds, and these seemed perfect, and some of them, which i tried,\\ngerminated. {362} but the following fact is more important: the crops of\\nbirds do not secrete gastric juice, and do not in the least injure, as i\\nknow by trial, the germination of seeds; now after a bird has found and\\ndevoured a large supply of food, it is positively asserted that all the\\ngrains do not pass into the gizzard for 12 or even 18 hours. a bird in this\\ninterval might easily be blown to the distance of 500 miles, and hawks are\\nknown to look out for tired birds, and the contents of their torn crops\\nmight thus readily get scattered. mr. brent informs me that a friend of his\\nhad to give up flying carrier-pigeons from france to england, as the hawks\\non the english coast destroyed so many on their arrival. some hawks and\\nowls bolt their prey whole, and after an interval of from twelve to twenty\\nhours, disgorge pellets, which, as i know from experiments made in the\\nzoological gardens, include seeds capable of germination. some seeds of the\\noat, wheat, millet, canary, hemp, clover, and beet germinated after having\\nbeen from twelve to twenty-one hours in the stomachs of different birds of\\nprey; and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two\\ndays and fourteen hours. freshwater fish, i find, eat seeds of many land\\nand water plants: fish are frequently devoured by birds, and thus the seeds\\nmight be transported from place to place. i forced many kinds of seeds into\\nthe stomachs of dead fish, and then gave their bodies to fishing-eagles,\\nstorks, and pelicans; these birds after an interval of many hours, either\\nrejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement; and\\nseveral of these seeds retained their power of germination. certain seeds,\\nhowever, were always killed by this process.\\n\\nalthough the beaks and feet of birds are generally quite clean, i can show\\nthat earth sometimes adheres to them: in one instance i removed twenty-two\\ngrains {363} of dry argillaceous earth from one foot of a partridge, and in\\nthis earth there was a pebble quite as large as the seed of a vetch. thus\\nseeds might occasionally be transported to great distances; for many facts\\ncould be given showing that soil almost everywhere is charged with seeds.\\nreflect for a moment on the millions of quails which annually cross the\\nmediterranean; and can we doubt that the earth adhering to their feet would\\nsometimes include a few minute seeds? but i shall presently have to recur\\nto this subject.\\n\\nas icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones, and\\nhave even carried brushwood, bones, and the nest of a land-bird, i can\\nhardly doubt that they must occasionally have transported seeds from one\\npart to another of the arctic and antarctic regions, as suggested by lyell;\\nand during the glacial period from one part of the now temperate regions to\\nanother. in the azores, from the large number of the species of plants\\ncommon to europe, in comparison with the plants of other oceanic islands\\nnearer to the mainland, and (as remarked by mr. h. c. watson) from the\\nsomewhat northern character of the flora in comparison with the latitude, i\\nsuspected that these islands had been partly stocked by ice-borne seeds,\\nduring the glacial epoch. at my request sir c. lyell wrote to m. hartung to\\ninquire whether he had observed erratic boulders on these islands, and he\\nanswered that he had found large fragments of granite and other rocks,\\nwhich do not occur in the archipelago. hence we may safely infer that\\nicebergs formerly landed their rocky burthens on the shores of these\\nmid-ocean islands, and it is at least possible that they may have brought\\nthither the seeds of northern plants.\\n\\nconsidering that the several above means of transport, and that several\\nother means, which without {364} doubt remain to be discovered, have been\\nin action year after year, for centuries and tens of thousands of years, it\\nwould i think be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become\\nwidely transported. these means of transport are sometimes called\\naccidental, but this is not strictly correct: the currents of the sea are\\nnot accidental, nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind. it should\\nbe observed that scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very\\ngreat distances; for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a\\ngreat length of time to the action of sea-water; nor could they be long\\ncarried in the crops or intestines of birds. these means, however, would\\nsuffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred miles in\\nbreadth, or from island to island, or from a continent to a neighbouring\\nisland, but not from one distant continent to another. the floras of\\ndistant continents would not by such means become mingled in any great\\ndegree; but would remain as distinct as we now see them to be. the\\ncurrents, from their course, would never bring seeds from north america to\\nbritain, though they might and do bring seeds from the west indies to our\\nwestern shores, where, if not killed by so long an immersion in salt-water,\\nthey could not endure our climate. almost every year, one or two land-birds\\nare blown across the whole atlantic ocean, from north america to the\\nwestern shores of ireland and england; but seeds could be transported by\\nthese wanderers only by one means, namely, in dirt sticking to their feet,\\nwhich is in itself a rare accident. even in this case, how small would the\\nchance be of a seed falling on favourable soil, and coming to maturity! but\\nit would be a great error to argue that because a well-stocked island, like\\ngreat britain, has not, as far as is known {365} (and it would be very\\ndifficult to prove this), received within the last few centuries, through\\noccasional means of transport, immigrants from europe or any other\\ncontinent, that a poorly-stocked island, though standing more remote from\\nthe mainland, would not receive colonists by similar means. i do not doubt\\nthat out of twenty seeds or animals transported to an island, even if far\\nless well-stocked than britain, scarcely more than one would be so well\\nfitted to its new home, as to become naturalised. but this, as it seems to\\nme, is no valid argument against what would be effected by occasional means\\nof transport, during the long lapse of geological time, whilst an island\\nwas being upheaved and formed, and before it had become fully stocked with\\ninhabitants. on almost bare land, with few or no destructive insects or\\nbirds living there, nearly every seed, which chanced to arrive, if fitted\\nfor the climate, would be sure to germinate and survive.\\n\\n\\n\\n_dispersal during the glacial period._--the identity of many plants and\\nanimals, on mountain-summits, separated from each other by hundreds of\\nmiles of lowlands, where the alpine species could not possibly exist, is\\none of the most striking cases known of the same species living at distant\\npoints, without the apparent possibility of their having migrated from one\\nto the other. it is indeed a remarkable fact to see so many of the same\\nplants living on the snowy regions of the alps or pyrenees, and in the\\nextreme northern parts of europe; but it is far more remarkable, that the\\nplants on the white mountains, in the united states of america, are all the\\nsame with those of labrador, and nearly all the same, as we hear from asa\\ngray, with those on the loftiest mountains of europe. even as long ago as\\n1747, such facts led gmelin to conclude that the {366} same species must\\nhave been independently created at several distinct points; and we might\\nhave remained in this same belief, had not agassiz and others called vivid\\nattention to the glacial period, which, as we shall immediately see,\\naffords a simple explanation of these facts. we have evidence of almost\\nevery conceivable kind, organic and inorganic, that within a very recent\\ngeological period, central europe and north america suffered under an\\narctic climate. the ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell their tale\\nmore plainly, than do the mountains of scotland and wales, with their\\nscored flanks, polished surfaces, and perched boulders, of the icy streams\\nwith which their valleys were lately filled. so greatly has the climate of\\neurope changed, that in northern italy, gigantic moraines, left by old\\nglaciers, are now clothed by the vine and maize. throughout a large part of\\nthe united states, erratic boulders, and rocks scored by drifted icebergs\\nand coast-ice, plainly reveal a former cold period.\\n\\nthe former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the\\ninhabitants of europe, as explained with remarkable clearness by edward\\nforbes, is substantially as follows. but we shall follow the changes more\\nreadily, by supposing a new glacial period to come slowly on, and then pass\\naway, as formerly occurred. as the cold came on, and as each more southern\\nzone became fitted for arctic beings and ill-fitted for their former more\\ntemperate inhabitants, the latter would be supplanted and arctic\\nproductions would take their places. the inhabitants of the more temperate\\nregions would at the same time travel southward, unless they were stopped\\nby barriers, in which case they would perish. the mountains would become\\ncovered with snow and ice, and their former alpine inhabitants would\\ndescend to the plains. by the time that the cold had reached {367} its\\nmaximum, we should have a uniform arctic fauna and flora, covering the\\ncentral parts of europe, as far south as the alps and pyrenees, and even\\nstretching into spain. the now temperate regions of the united states would\\nlikewise be covered by arctic plants and animals, and these would be nearly\\nthe same with those of europe; for the present circumpolar inhabitants,\\nwhich we suppose to have everywhere travelled southward, are remarkably\\nuniform round the world. we may suppose that the glacial period came on a\\nlittle earlier or later in north america than in europe, so will the\\nsouthern migration there have been a little earlier or later; but this will\\nmake no difference in the final result.\\n\\nas the warmth returned, the arctic forms would retreat northward, closely\\nfollowed up in their retreat by the productions of the more temperate\\nregions. and as the snow melted from the bases of the mountains, the arctic\\nforms would seize on the cleared and thawed ground, always ascending higher\\nand higher, as the warmth increased, whilst their brethren were pursuing\\ntheir northern journey. hence, when the warmth had fully returned, the same\\narctic species, which had lately lived in a body together on the lowlands\\nof the old and new worlds, would be left isolated on distant\\nmountain-summits (having been exterminated on all lesser heights) and in\\nthe arctic regions of both hemispheres.\\n\\nthus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so immensely\\nremote as on the mountains of the united states and of europe. we can thus\\nalso understand the fact that the alpine plants of each mountain-range are\\nmore especially related to the arctic forms living due north or nearly due\\nnorth of them: for the migration as the cold came on, and the re-migration\\non the returning warmth, will generally {368} have been due south and\\nnorth. the alpine plants, for example, of scotland, as remarked by mr.\\nh. c. watson, and those of the pyrenees, as remarked by ramond, are more\\nespecially allied to the plants of northern scandinavia; those of the\\nunited states to labrador; those of the mountains of siberia to the arctic\\nregions of that country. these views, grounded as they are on the perfectly\\nwell-ascertained occurrence of a former glacial period, seem to me to\\nexplain in so satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the alpine\\nand arctic productions of europe and america, that when in other regions we\\nfind the same species on distant mountain-summits, we may almost conclude\\nwithout other evidence, that a colder climate permitted their former\\nmigration across the low intervening tracts, since become too warm for\\ntheir existence.\\n\\nif the climate, since the glacial period, has ever been in any degree\\nwarmer than at present (as some geologists in the united states believe to\\nhave been the case, chiefly from the distribution of the fossil gnathodon),\\nthen the arctic and temperate productions will at a very late period have\\nmarched a little further north, and subsequently have retreated to their\\npresent homes; but i have met with no satisfactory evidence with respect to\\nthis intercalated slightly warmer period, since the glacial period.\\n\\nthe arctic forms, during their long southern migration and re-migration\\nnorthward, will have been exposed to nearly the same climate, and, as is\\nespecially to be noticed, they will have kept in a body together;\\nconsequently their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed, and,\\nin accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume, they will not\\nhave been liable to much modification. but with our alpine productions,\\nleft isolated from the moment of the returning warmth, {369} first at the\\nbases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains, the case will have\\nbeen somewhat different; for it is not likely that all the same arctic\\nspecies will have been left on mountain ranges distant from each other, and\\nhave survived there ever since; they will, also, in all probability have\\nbecome mingled with ancient alpine species, which must have existed on the\\nmountains before the commencement of the glacial epoch, and which during\\nits coldest period will have been temporarily driven down to the plains;\\nthey will, also, have been exposed to somewhat different climatal\\ninfluences. their mutual relations will thus have been in some degree\\ndisturbed; consequently they will have been liable to modification; and\\nthis we find has been the case; for if we compare the present alpine plants\\nand animals of the several great european mountain-ranges, though very many\\nof the species are identically the same, some present varieties, some are\\nranked as doubtful forms, and some few are distinct yet closely allied or\\nrepresentative species.\\n\\nin illustrating what, as i believe, actually took place during the glacial\\nperiod, i assumed that at its commencement the arctic productions were as\\nuniform round the polar regions as they are at the present day. but the\\nforegoing remarks on distribution apply not only to strictly arctic forms,\\nbut also to many sub-arctic and to some few northern temperate forms, for\\nsome of these are the same on the lower mountains and on the plains of\\nnorth america and europe; and it may be reasonably asked how i account for\\nthe necessary degree of uniformity of the sub-arctic and northern temperate\\nforms round the world, at the commencement of the glacial period. at the\\npresent day, the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions of the old\\nand new worlds are separated from each other by the {370} atlantic ocean\\nand by the extreme northern part of the pacific. during the glacial period,\\nwhen the inhabitants of the old and new worlds lived further southwards\\nthan at present, they must have been still more completely separated by\\nwider spaces of ocean. i believe the above difficulty may be surmounted by\\nlooking to still earlier changes of climate of an opposite nature. we have\\ngood reason to believe that during the newer pliocene period, before the\\nglacial epoch, and whilst the majority of the inhabitants of the world were\\nspecifically the same as now, the climate was warmer than at the present\\nday. hence we may suppose that the organisms now living under the climate\\nof latitude 60в°, during the pliocene period lived further north under the\\npolar circle, in latitude 66в°-67в°; and that the strictly arctic productions\\nthen lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole. now if we look at a\\nglobe, we shall see that under the polar circle there is almost continuous\\nland from western europe, through siberia, to eastern america. and to this\\ncontinuity of the circumpolar land, and to the consequent freedom for\\nintermigration under a more favourable climate, i attribute the necessary\\namount of uniformity in the sub-arctic and northern temperate productions\\nof the old and new worlds, at a period anterior to the glacial epoch.\\n\\nbelieving, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have long\\nremained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected to large,\\nbut partial oscillations of level, i am strongly inclined to extend the\\nabove view, and to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period,\\nsuch as the older pliocene period, a large number of the same plants and\\nanimals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land; and that these\\nplants and animals, both in the old and {371} new worlds, began slowly to\\nmigrate southwards as the climate became less warm, long before the\\ncommencement of the glacial period. we now see, as i believe, their\\ndescendants, mostly in a modified condition, in the central parts of europe\\nand the united states. on this view we can understand the relationship,\\nwith very little identity, between the productions of north america and\\neurope,--a relationship which is most remarkable, considering the distance\\nof the two areas, and their separation by the atlantic ocean. we can\\nfurther understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers, that\\nthe productions of europe and america during the later tertiary stages were\\nmore closely related to each other than they are at the present time; for\\nduring these warmer periods the northern parts of the old and new worlds\\nwill have been almost continuously united by land, serving as a bridge,\\nsince rendered impassable by cold, for the intermigration of their\\ninhabitants.\\n\\nduring the slowly decreasing warmth of the pliocene period, as soon as the\\nspecies in common, which inhabited the new and old worlds, migrated south\\nof the polar circle, they must have been completely cut off from each\\nother. this separation, as far as the more temperate productions are\\nconcerned, took place long ages ago. and as the plants and animals migrated\\nsouthward, they will have become mingled in the one great region with the\\nnative american productions, and have had to compete with them; and in the\\nother great region, with those of the old world. consequently we have here\\neverything favourable for much modification,--for far more modification\\nthan with the alpine productions, left isolated, within a much more recent\\nperiod, on the several mountain-ranges and on the arctic lands of the two\\nworlds. hence it has come, that when we compare {372} the now living\\nproductions of the temperate regions of the new and old worlds, we find\\nvery few identical species (though asa gray has lately shown that more\\nplants are identical than was formerly supposed), but we find in every\\ngreat class many forms, which some naturalists rank as geographical races,\\nand others as distinct species; and a host of closely allied or\\nrepresentative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as specifically\\ndistinct.\\n\\nas on the land, so in the waters of the sea, a slow southern migration of a\\nmarine fauna, which during the pliocene or even a somewhat earlier period,\\nwas nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the polar circle, will\\naccount, on the theory of modification, for many closely allied forms now\\nliving in areas completely sundered. thus, i think, we can understand the\\npresence of many existing and tertiary representative forms on the eastern\\nand western shores of temperate north america; and the still more striking\\ncase of many closely allied crustaceans (as described in dana\\'s admirable\\nwork), of some fish and other marine animals, in the mediterranean and in\\nthe seas of japan,--areas now separated by a continent and by nearly a\\nhemisphere of equatorial ocean.\\n\\nthese cases of relationship, without identity, of the inhabitants of seas\\nnow disjoined, and likewise of the past and present inhabitants of the\\ntemperate lands of north america and europe, are inexplicable on the theory\\nof creation. we cannot say that they have been created alike, in\\ncorrespondence with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas;\\nfor if we compare, for instance, certain parts of south america with the\\nsouthern continents of the old world, we see countries closely\\ncorresponding in all their physical conditions, but with their inhabitants\\nutterly dissimilar. {373}\\n\\nbut we must return to our more immediate subject, the glacial period. i am\\nconvinced that forbes\\'s view may be largely extended. in europe we have the\\nplainest evidence of the cold period, from the western shores of britain to\\nthe oural range, and southward to the pyrenees. we may infer from the\\nfrozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation, that siberia was\\nsimilarly affected. along the himalaya, at points 900 miles apart, glaciers\\nhave left the marks of their former low descent; and in sikkim, dr. hooker\\nsaw maize growing on gigantic ancient moraines. south of the equator, we\\nhave some direct evidence of former glacial action in new zealand; and the\\nsame plants, found on widely separated mountains in that island, tell the\\nsame story. if one account which has been published can be trusted, we have\\ndirect evidence of glacial action in the south-eastern corner of australia.\\n\\nlooking to america; in the northern half, ice-borne fragments of rock have\\nbeen observed on the eastern side as far south as lat. 36в°-37в°, and on the\\nshores of the pacific, where the climate is now so different, as far south\\nas lat. 46в°; erratic boulders have, also, been noticed on the rocky\\nmountains. in the cordillera of equatorial south america, glaciers once\\nextended far below their present level. in central chili i was astonished\\nat the structure of a vast mound of detritus, about 800 feet in height,\\ncrossing a valley of the andes; and this i now feel convinced was a\\ngigantic moraine, left far below any existing glacier. further south on\\nboth sides of the continent, from lat. 41в° to the southernmost extremity,\\nwe have the clearest evidence of former glacial action, in huge boulders\\ntransported far from their parent source.\\n\\nwe do not know that the glacial epoch was strictly simultaneous at these\\nseveral far distant points on {374} opposite sides of the world. but we\\nhave good evidence in almost every case, that the epoch was included within\\nthe latest geological period. we have, also, excellent evidence, that it\\nendured for an enormous time, as measured by years, at each point. the cold\\nmay have come on, or have ceased, earlier at one point of the globe than at\\nanother, but seeing that it endured for long at each, and that it was\\ncontemporaneous in a geological sense, it seems to me probable that it was,\\nduring a part at least of the period, actually simultaneous throughout the\\nworld. without some distinct evidence to the contrary, we may at least\\nadmit as probable that the glacial action was simultaneous on the eastern\\nand western sides of north america, in the cordillera under the equator and\\nunder the warmer temperate zones, and on both sides of the southern\\nextremity of the continent. if this be admitted, it is difficult to avoid\\nbelieving that the temperature of the whole world was at this period\\nsimultaneously cooler. but it would suffice for my purpose, if the\\ntemperature was at the same time lower along certain broad belts of\\nlongitude.\\n\\non this view of the whole world, or at least of broad longitudinal belts,\\nhaving been simultaneously colder from pole to pole, much light can be\\nthrown on the present distribution of identical and allied species. in\\namerica, dr. hooker has shown that between forty and fifty of the flowering\\nplants of tierra del fuego, forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty\\nflora, are common to europe, enormously remote as these two points are; and\\nthere are many closely allied species. on the lofty mountains of equatorial\\namerica a host of peculiar species belonging to european genera occur. on\\nthe highest mountains of brazil, some few european genera were found by\\ngardner, which do not exist in the wide {375} intervening hot countries. so\\non the silla of caraccas the illustrious humboldt long ago found species\\nbelonging to genera characteristic of the cordillera. on the mountains of\\nabyssinia, several european forms and some few representatives of the\\npeculiar flora of the cape of good hope occur. at the cape of good hope a\\nvery few european species, believed not to have been introduced by man, and\\non the mountains, some few representative european forms are found, which\\nhave not been discovered in the intertropical parts of africa. on the\\nhimalaya, and on the isolated mountain-ranges of the peninsula of india, on\\nthe heights of ceylon, and on the volcanic cones of java, many plants\\noccur, either identically the same or representing each other, and at the\\nsame time representing plants of europe, not found in the intervening hot\\nlowlands. a list of the genera collected on the loftier peaks of java\\nraises a picture of a collection made on a hill in europe! still more\\nstriking is the fact that southern australian forms are clearly represented\\nby plants growing on the summits of the mountains of borneo. some of these\\naustralian forms, as i hear from dr. hooker, extend along the heights of\\nthe peninsula of malacca, and are thinly scattered, on the one hand over\\nindia and on the other as far north as japan.\\n\\non the southern mountains of australia, dr. f. mгјller has discovered\\nseveral european species; other species, not introduced by man, occur on\\nthe lowlands; and a long list can be given, as i am informed by dr. hooker,\\nof european genera, found in australia, but not in the intermediate torrid\\nregions. in the admirable \\'introduction to the flora of new zealand,\\' by\\ndr. hooker, analogous and striking facts are given in regard to the plants\\nof that large island. hence we see that throughout the world, the plants\\ngrowing on the {376} more lofty mountains, and on the temperate lowlands of\\nthe northern and southern hemispheres, are sometimes identically the same;\\nbut they are much oftener specifically distinct, though related to each\\nother in a most remarkable manner.\\n\\nthis brief abstract applies to plants alone: some strictly analogous facts\\ncould be given on the distribution of terrestrial animals. in marine\\nproductions, similar cases occur; as an example, i may quote a remark by\\nthe highest authority, prof. dana, that \"it is certainly a wonderful fact\\nthat new zealand should have a closer resemblance in its crustacea to great\\nbritain, its antipode, than to any other part of the world.\" sir j.\\nrichardson, also, speaks of the reappearance on the shores of new zealand,\\ntasmania, &c., of northern forms of fish. dr. hooker informs me that\\ntwenty-five species of algг¦ are common to new zealand and to europe, but\\nhave not been found in the intermediate tropical seas.\\n\\nit should be observed that the northern species and forms found in the\\nsouthern parts of the southern hemisphere, and on the mountain-ranges of\\nthe intertropical regions, are not arctic, but belong to the northern\\ntemperate zones. as mr. h. c. watson has recently remarked, \"in receding\\nfrom polar towards equatorial latitudes, the alpine or mountain floras\\nreally become less and less arctic.\" many of the forms living on the\\nmountains of the warmer regions of the earth and in the southern hemisphere\\nare of doubtful value, being ranked by some naturalists as specifically\\ndistinct, by others as varieties; but some are certainly identical, and\\nmany, though closely related to northern forms, must be ranked as distinct\\nspecies.\\n\\nnow let us see what light can be thrown on the foregoing facts, on the\\nbelief, supported as it is by a large {377} body of geological evidence,\\nthat the whole world, or a large part of it, was during the glacial period\\nsimultaneously much colder than at present. the glacial period, as measured\\nby years, must have been very long; and when we remember over what vast\\nspaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread within a few\\ncenturies, this period will have been ample for any amount of migration. as\\nthe cold came slowly on, all the tropical plants and other productions will\\nhave retreated from both sides towards the equator, followed in the rear by\\nthe temperate productions, and these by the arctic; but with the latter we\\nare not now concerned. the tropical plants probably suffered much\\nextinction; how much no one can say; perhaps formerly the tropics supported\\nas many species as we see at the present day crowded together at the cape\\nof good hope, and in parts of temperate australia. as we know that many\\ntropical plants and animals can withstand a considerable amount of cold,\\nmany might have escaped extermination during a moderate fall of\\ntemperature, more especially by escaping into the lowest, most protected,\\nand warmest districts. but the great fact to bear in mind is, that all\\ntropical productions will have suffered to a certain extent. on the other\\nhand, the temperate productions, after migrating nearer to the equator,\\nthough they will have been placed under somewhat new conditions, will have\\nsuffered less. and it is certain that many temperate plants, if protected\\nfrom the inroads of competitors, can withstand a much warmer climate than\\ntheir own. hence, it seems to me possible, bearing in mind that the\\ntropical productions were in a suffering state and could not have presented\\na firm front against intruders, that a certain number of the more vigorous\\nand dominant temperate forms might have penetrated the native ranks and\\nhave reached or {378} even crossed the equator. the invasion would, of\\ncourse, have been greatly favoured by high land, and perhaps by a dry\\nclimate; for dr. falconer informs me that it is the damp with the heat of\\nthe tropics which is so destructive to perennial plants from a temperate\\nclimate. on the other hand, the most humid and hottest districts will have\\nafforded an asylum to the tropical natives. the mountain-ranges north-west\\nof the himalaya, and the long line of the cordillera, seem to have afforded\\ntwo great lines of invasion: and it is a striking fact, lately communicated\\nto me by dr. hooker, that all the flowering plants, about forty-six in\\nnumber, common to tierra del fuego and to europe still exist in north\\namerica, which must have lain on the line of march. but i do not doubt that\\nsome temperate productions entered and crossed even the _lowlands_ of the\\ntropics at the period when the cold was most intense,--when arctic forms\\nhad migrated some twenty-five degrees of latitude from their native country\\nand covered the land at the foot of the pyrenees. at this period of extreme\\ncold, i believe that the climate under the equator at the level of the sea\\nwas about the same with that now felt there at the height of six or seven\\nthousand feet. during this the coldest period, i suppose that large spaces\\nof the tropical lowlands were clothed with a mingled tropical and temperate\\nvegetation, like that now growing with strange luxuriance at the base of\\nthe himalaya, as graphically described by hooker.\\n\\nthus, as i believe, a considerable number of plants, a few terrestrial\\nanimals, and some marine productions, migrated during the glacial period\\nfrom the northern and southern temperate zones into the intertropical\\nregions, and some even crossed the equator. as the warmth returned, these\\ntemperate forms would naturally ascend the higher mountains, being\\nexterminated on the {379} lowlands; those which had not reached the equator\\nwould re-migrate northward or southward towards their former homes; but the\\nforms, chiefly northern, which had crossed the equator, would travel still\\nfurther from their homes into the more temperate latitudes of the opposite\\nhemisphere. although we have reason to believe from geological evidence\\nthat the whole body of arctic shells underwent scarcely any modification\\nduring their long southern migration and re-migration northward, the case\\nmay have been wholly different with those intruding forms which settled\\nthemselves on the intertropical mountains, and in the southern hemisphere.\\nthese being surrounded by strangers will have had to compete with many new\\nforms of life; and it is probable that selected modifications in their\\nstructure, habits, and constitutions will have profited them. thus many of\\nthese wanderers, though still plainly related by inheritance to their\\nbrethren of the northern or southern hemispheres, now exist in their new\\nhomes as well-marked varieties or as distinct species.\\n\\nit is a remarkable fact, strongly insisted on by hooker in regard to\\namerica, and by alph. de candolle in regard to australia, that many more\\nidentical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from the north\\nto the south, than in a reversed direction. we see, however, a few southern\\nvegetable forms on the mountains of borneo and abyssinia. i suspect that\\nthis preponderant migration from north to south is due to the greater\\nextent of land in the north, and to the northern forms having existed in\\ntheir own homes in greater numbers, and having consequently been advanced\\nthrough natural selection and competition to a higher stage of perfection\\nor dominating power, than the southern forms. and thus, when they became\\ncommingled during the glacial period, the northern forms {380} were enabled\\nto beat the less powerful southern forms. just in the same manner as we see\\nat the present day, that very many european productions cover the ground in\\nla plata, and in a lesser degree in australia, and have to a certain extent\\nbeaten the natives; whereas extremely few southern forms have become\\nnaturalised in any part of europe, though hides, wool, and other objects\\nlikely to carry seeds have been largely imported into europe during the\\nlast two or three centuries from la plata, and during the last thirty or\\nforty years from australia. something of the same kind must have occurred\\non the intertropical mountains: no doubt before the glacial period they\\nwere stocked with endemic alpine forms; but these have almost everywhere\\nlargely yielded to the more dominant forms, generated in the larger areas\\nand more efficient workshops of the north. in many islands the native\\nproductions are nearly equalled or even outnumbered by the naturalised; and\\nif the natives have not been actually exterminated, their numbers have been\\ngreatly reduced, and this is the first stage towards extinction. a mountain\\nis an island on the land; and the intertropical mountains before the\\nglacial period must have been completely isolated; and i believe that the\\nproductions of these islands on the land yielded to those produced within\\nthe larger areas of the north, just in the same way as the productions of\\nreal islands have everywhere lately yielded to continental forms,\\nnaturalised by man\\'s agency.\\n\\ni am far from supposing that all difficulties are removed on the view here\\ngiven in regard to the range and affinities of the allied species which\\nlive in the northern and southern temperate zones and on the mountains of\\nthe intertropical regions. very many difficulties remain to be solved. i do\\nnot pretend to {381} indicate the exact lines and means of migration, or\\nthe reason why certain species and not others have migrated; why certain\\nspecies have been modified and have given rise to new groups of forms, and\\nothers have remained unaltered. we cannot hope to explain such facts, until\\nwe can say why one species and not another becomes naturalised by man\\'s\\nagency in a foreign land; why one ranges twice or thrice as far, and is\\ntwice or thrice as common, as another species within their own homes.\\n\\ni have said that many difficulties remain to be solved: some of the most\\nremarkable are stated with admirable clearness by dr. hooker in his\\nbotanical works on the antarctic regions. these cannot be here discussed. i\\nwill only say that as far as regards the occurrence of identical species at\\npoints so enormously remote as kerguelen land, new zealand, and fuegia, i\\nbelieve that towards the close of the glacial period, icebergs, as\\nsuggested by lyell, have been largely concerned in their dispersal. but the\\nexistence of several quite distinct species, belonging to genera\\nexclusively confined to the south, at these and other distant points of the\\nsouthern hemisphere, is, on my theory of descent with modification, a far\\nmore remarkable case of difficulty. for some of these species are so\\ndistinct, that we cannot suppose that there has been time since the\\ncommencement of the glacial period for their migration, and for their\\nsubsequent modification to the necessary degree. the facts seem to me to\\nindicate that peculiar and very distinct species have migrated in radiating\\nlines from some common centre; and i am inclined to look in the southern,\\nas in the northern hemisphere, to a former and warmer period, before the\\ncommencement of the glacial period, when the antarctic lands, now covered\\nwith ice, supported a highly peculiar {382} and isolated flora. i suspect\\nthat before this flora was exterminated by the glacial epoch, a few forms\\nwere widely dispersed to various points of the southern hemisphere by\\noccasional means of transport, and by the aid, as halting-places, of\\nexisting and now sunken islands: by these means, as i believe, the southern\\nshores of america, australia, new zealand, have become slightly tinted by\\nthe same peculiar forms of vegetable life.\\n\\nsir c. lyell in a striking passage has speculated, in language almost\\nidentical with mine, on the effects of great alternations of climate on\\ngeographical distribution. i believe that the world has recently felt one\\nof his great cycles of change; and that on this view, combined with\\nmodification through natural selection, a multitude of facts in the present\\ndistribution both of the same and of allied forms of life can be explained.\\nthe living waters may be said to have flowed during one short period from\\nthe north and from the south, and to have crossed at the equator; but to\\nhave flowed with greater force from the north so as to have freely\\ninundated the south. as the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines,\\nthough rising higher on the shores where the tide rises highest, so have\\nthe living waters left their living drift on our mountain-summits, in a\\nline gently rising from the arctic lowlands to a great height under the\\nequator. the various beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage\\nraces of man, driven up and surviving in the mountain-fastnesses of almost\\nevery land, which serve as a record, full of interest to us, of the former\\ninhabitants of the surrounding lowlands.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *

of terrestrial mammals--on the\\n    relation of the inhabitants of islands to those of the nearest\\n    mainland--on colonisation from the nearest source with subsequent\\n    modification--summary of the last and present chapters.\\n\\nas lakes and river-systems are separated from each other by barriers of\\nland, it might have been thought that fresh-water productions would not\\nhave ranged widely within the same country, and as the sea is apparently a\\nstill more impassable barrier, that they never would have extended to\\ndistant countries. but the case is exactly the reverse. not only have many\\nfresh-water species, belonging to quite different classes, an enormous\\nrange, but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner throughout the\\nworld. i well remember, when first collecting in the fresh waters of\\nbrazil, feeling much surprise at the similarity of the fresh-water insects,\\nshells, &c., and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding terrestrial\\nbeings, compared with those of britain.\\n\\nbut this power in fresh-water productions of ranging widely, though so\\nunexpected, can, i think, in most cases be explained by their having become\\nfitted, in a manner highly useful to them, for short and frequent\\nmigrations from pond to pond, or from stream to stream; and liability to\\nwide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary\\nconsequence. we can here consider only a few cases. in regard to {384}\\nfish, i believe that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of\\ndistant continents. but on the same continent the species often range\\nwidely and almost capriciously; for two river-systems will have some fish\\nin common and some different. a few facts seem to favour the possibility of\\ntheir occasional transport by accidental means; like that of the live fish\\nnot rarely dropped by whirlwinds in india, and the vitality of their ova\\nwhen removed from the water. but i am inclined to attribute the dispersal\\nof fresh-water fish mainly to slight changes within the recent period in\\nthe level of the land, having caused rivers to flow into each other.\\ninstances, also, could be given of this having occurred during floods,\\nwithout any change of level. we have evidence in the loess of the rhine of\\nconsiderable changes of level in the land within a very recent geological\\nperiod, and when the surface was peopled by existing land and fresh-water\\nshells. the wide difference of the fish on opposite sides of continuous\\nmountain-ranges, which from an early period must have parted river-systems\\nand completely prevented their inosculation, seems to lead to this same\\nconclusion. with respect to allied fresh-water fish occurring at very\\ndistant points of the world, no doubt there are many cases which cannot at\\npresent be explained: but some fresh-water fish belong to very ancient\\nforms, and in such cases there will have been ample time for great\\ngeographical changes, and consequently time and means for much migration.\\nin the second place, salt-water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to\\nlive in fresh water; and, according to valenciennes, there is hardly a\\nsingle group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh water, so that we may\\nimagine that a marine member of a fresh-water group might travel far along\\nthe shores of the sea, and {385} subsequently become modified and adapted\\nto the fresh waters of a distant land.\\n\\nsome species of fresh-water shells have a very wide range, and allied\\nspecies, which, on my theory, are descended from a common parent and must\\nhave proceeded from a single source, prevail throughout the world. their\\ndistribution at first perplexed me much, as their ova are not likely to be\\ntransported by birds, and they are immediately killed by sea-water, as are\\nthe adults. i could not even understand how some naturalised species have\\nrapidly spread throughout the same country. but two facts, which i have\\nobserved--and no doubt many others remain to be observed--throw some light\\non this subject. when a duck suddenly emerges from a pond covered with\\nduck-weed, i have twice seen these little plants adhering to its back; and\\nit has happened to me, in removing a little duckweed from one aquarium to\\nanother, that i have quite unintentionally stocked the one with fresh-water\\nshells from the other. but another agency is perhaps more effectual: i\\nsuspended a duck\\'s feet, which might represent those of a bird sleeping in\\na natural pond, in an aquarium, where many ova of fresh-water shells were\\nhatching; and i found that numbers of the extremely minute and just-hatched\\nshells crawled on the feet, and clung to them so firmly that when taken out\\nof the water they could not be jarred off, though at a somewhat more\\nadvanced age they would voluntarily drop off. these just hatched molluscs,\\nthough aquatic in their nature, survived on the duck\\'s feet, in damp air,\\nfrom twelve to twenty hours; and in this length of time a duck or heron\\nmight fly at least six or seven hundred miles, and would be sure to alight\\non a pool or rivulet, if blown across sea to an oceanic island or to any\\nother distant point. sir charles lyell also {386} informs me that a dyticus\\nhas been caught with an ancylus (a fresh-water shell like a limpet) firmly\\nadhering to it; and a water-beetle of the same family, a colymbetes, once\\nflew on board the \\'beagle,\\' when forty-five miles distant from the nearest\\nland: how much farther it might have flown with a favouring gale no one can\\ntell.\\n\\nwith respect to plants, it has long been known what enormous ranges many\\nfresh-water and even marsh-species have, both over continents and to the\\nmost remote oceanic islands. this is strikingly shown, as remarked by alph.\\nde candolle, in large groups of terrestrial plants, which have only a very\\nfew aquatic members; for these latter seem immediately to acquire, as if in\\nconsequence, a very wide range. i think favourable means of dispersal\\nexplain this fact. i have before mentioned that earth occasionally, though\\nrarely, adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks of birds. wading\\nbirds, which frequent the muddy edges of ponds, if suddenly flushed, would\\nbe the most likely to have muddy feet. birds of this order i can show are\\nthe greatest wanderers, and are occasionally found on the most remote and\\nbarren islands in the open ocean; they would not be likely to alight on the\\nsurface of the sea, so that the dirt would not be washed off their feet;\\nwhen making land, they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh-water\\nhaunts. i do not believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of\\nponds is with seeds: i have tried several little experiments, but will here\\ngive only the most striking case: i took in february three table-spoonfuls\\nof mud from three different points, beneath water, on the edge of a little\\npond; this mud when dry weighed only 6вѕ ounces; i kept it covered up in my\\nstudy for six months, pulling up and counting each plant as it grew; the\\nplants were {387} of many kinds, and were altogether 537 in number; and yet\\nthe viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup! considering these\\nfacts, i think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if water-birds did\\nnot transport the seeds of fresh-water plants to vast distances, and if\\nconsequently the range of these plants was not very great. the same agency\\nmay have come into play with the eggs of some of the smaller fresh-water\\nanimals.\\n\\nother and unknown agencies probably have also played a part. i have stated\\nthat fresh-water fish eat some kinds of seeds, though they reject many\\nother kinds after having swallowed them; even small fish swallow seeds of\\nmoderate size, as of the yellow water-lily and potamogeton. herons and\\nother birds, century after century, have gone on daily devouring fish; they\\nthen take flight and go to other waters, or are blown across the sea; and\\nwe have seen that seeds retain their power of germination, when rejected in\\npellets or in excrement, many hours afterwards. when i saw the great size\\nof the seeds of that fine water-lily, the nelumbium, and remembered alph.\\nde candolle\\'s remarks on this plant, i thought that its distribution must\\nremain quite inexplicable; but audubon states that he found the seeds of\\nthe great southern water-lily (probably, according to dr. hooker, the\\nnelumbium luteum) in a heron\\'s stomach; although i do not know the fact,\\nyet analogy makes me believe that a heron flying to another pond and\\ngetting a hearty meal of fish, would probably reject from its stomach a\\npellet containing the seeds of the nelumbium undigested; or the seeds might\\nbe dropped by the bird whilst feeding its young, in the same way as fish\\nare known sometimes to be dropped.\\n\\nin considering these several means of distribution, {388} it should be\\nremembered that when a pond or stream is first formed, for instance, on a\\nrising islet, it will be unoccupied; and a single seed or egg will have a\\ngood chance of succeeding. although there will always be a struggle for\\nlife between the individuals of the species, however few, already occupying\\nany pond, yet as the number of kinds is small, compared with those on the\\nland, the competition will probably be less severe between aquatic than\\nbetween terrestrial species; consequently an intruder from the waters of a\\nforeign country, would have a better chance of seizing on a place, than in\\nthe case of terrestrial colonists. we should, also, remember that some,\\nperhaps many, freshwater productions are low in the scale of nature, and\\nthat we have reason to believe that such low beings change or become\\nmodified less quickly than the high; and this will give longer time than\\nthe average for the migration of the same aquatic species. we should not\\nforget the probability of many species having formerly ranged as\\ncontinuously as fresh-water productions ever can range, over immense areas,\\nand having subsequently become extinct in intermediate regions. but the\\nwide distribution of fresh-water plants and of the lower animals, whether\\nretaining the same identical form or in some degree modified, i believe\\nmainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals,\\nmore especially by fresh-water birds, which have large powers of flight,\\nand naturally travel from one to another and often distant piece of water.\\nnature, like a careful gardener, thus takes her seeds from a bed of a\\nparticular nature, and drops them in another equally well fitted for them.\\n\\n\\n\\n_on the inhabitants of oceanic islands._--we now come to the last of the\\nthree classes of facts, which i {389} have selected as presenting the\\ngreatest amount of difficulty, on the view that all the individuals both of\\nthe same and of allied species have descended from a single parent; and\\ntherefore have all proceeded from a common birthplace, notwithstanding that\\nin the course of time they have come to inhabit distant points of the\\nglobe. i have already stated that i cannot honestly admit forbes\\'s view on\\ncontinental extensions, which, if legitimately followed out, would lead to\\nthe belief that within the recent period all existing islands have been\\nnearly or quite joined to some continent. this view would remove many\\ndifficulties, but it would not, i think, explain all the facts in regard to\\ninsular productions. in the following remarks i shall not confine myself to\\nthe mere question of dispersal; but shall consider some other facts, which\\nbear on the truth of the two theories of independent creation and of\\ndescent with modification.\\n\\nthe species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number\\ncompared with those on equal continental areas: alph. de candolle admits\\nthis for plants, and wollaston for insects. if we look to the large size\\nand varied stations of new zealand, extending over 780 miles of latitude,\\nand compare its flowering plants, only 750 in number, with those on an\\nequal area at the cape of good hope or in australia, we must, i think,\\nadmit that something quite independently of any difference in physical\\nconditions has caused so great a difference in number. even the uniform\\ncounty of cambridge has 847 plants, and the little island of anglesea 764,\\nbut a few ferns and a few introduced plants are included in these numbers,\\nand the comparison in some other respects is not quite fair. we have\\nevidence that the barren island of ascension aboriginally possessed under\\nhalf-a-dozen flowering plants; {390} yet many have become naturalised on\\nit, as they have on new zealand and on every other oceanic island which can\\nbe named. in st. helena there is reason to believe that the naturalised\\nplants and animals have nearly or quite exterminated many native\\nproductions. he who admits the doctrine of the creation of each separate\\nspecies, will have to admit, that a sufficient number of the best adapted\\nplants and animals have not been created on oceanic islands; for man has\\nunintentionally stocked them from various sources far more fully and\\nperfectly than has nature.\\n\\nalthough in oceanic islands the number of kinds of inhabitants is scanty,\\nthe proportion of endemic species (_i.e._ those found nowhere else in the\\nworld) is often extremely large. if we compare, for instance, the number of\\nthe endemic land-shells in madeira, or of the endemic birds in the\\ngalapagos archipelago, with the number found on any continent, and then\\ncompare the area of the islands with that of the continent, we shall see\\nthat this is true. this fact might have been expected on my theory, for, as\\nalready explained, species occasionally arriving after long intervals in a\\nnew and isolated district, and having to compete with new associates, will\\nbe eminently liable to modification, and will often produce groups of\\nmodified descendants. but it by no means follows, that, because in an\\nisland nearly all the species of one class are peculiar, those of another\\nclass, or of another section of the same class, are peculiar; and this\\ndifference seems to depend partly on the species which do not become\\nmodified having immigrated with facility and in a body, so that their\\nmutual relations have not been much disturbed; and partly on the frequent\\narrival of unmodified immigrants from the mother-country, and the\\nconsequent intercrossing with them. with respect to the effects of this\\nintercrossing, {391} it should be remembered that the offspring of such\\ncrosses would almost certainly gain in vigour; so that even an occasional\\ncross would produce more effect than might at first have been anticipated.\\nto give a few examples: in the galapagos islands nearly every land-bird,\\nbut only two out of the eleven marine birds, are peculiar; and it is\\nobvious that marine birds could arrive at these islands more easily than\\nland-birds. bermuda, on the other hand, which lies at about the same\\ndistance from north america as the galapagos islands do from south america,\\nand which has a very peculiar soil, does not possess one endemic land-bird;\\nand we know from mr. j. m. jones\\'s admirable account of bermuda, that very\\nmany north american birds, during their great annual migrations, visit\\neither periodically or occasionally this island. madeira does not possess\\none peculiar bird, and many european and african birds are almost every\\nyear blown there, as i am informed by mr. e. v. harcourt. so that these two\\nislands of bermuda and madeira have been stocked by birds, which for long\\nages have struggled together in their former homes, and have become\\nmutually adapted to each other; and when settled in their new homes, each\\nkind will have been kept by the others to their proper places and habits,\\nand will consequently have been little liable to modification. any tendency\\nto modification will, also, have been checked by intercrossing with the\\nunmodified immigrants from the mother-country. madeira, again, is inhabited\\nby a wonderful number of peculiar land-shells, whereas not one species of\\nsea-shell is confined to its shores: now, though we do not know how\\nsea-shells are dispersed, yet we can see that their eggs or larvae, perhaps\\nattached to seaweed or floating timber, or to the feet of wading-birds,\\nmight be transported far more easily than {392} land-shells, across three\\nor four hundred miles of open sea. the different orders of insects in\\nmadeira apparently present analogous facts.\\n\\noceanic islands are sometimes deficient in certain classes, and their\\nplaces are apparently occupied by the other inhabitants; in the galapagos\\nislands reptiles, and in new zealand gigantic wingless birds, take the\\nplace of mammals. in the plants of the galapagos islands, dr. hooker has\\nshown that the proportional numbers of the different orders are very\\ndifferent from what they are elsewhere. such cases are generally accounted\\nfor by the physical conditions of the islands; but this explanation seems\\nto me not a little doubtful. facility of immigration, i believe, has been\\nat least as important as the nature of the conditions.\\n\\nmany remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants\\nof remote islands. for instance, in certain islands not tenanted by\\nmammals, some of the endemic plants have beautifully hooked seeds; yet few\\nrelations are more striking than the adaptation of hooked seeds for\\ntransportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds. this case presents no\\ndifficulty on my view, for a hooked seed might be transported to an island\\nby some other means; and the plant then becoming slightly modified, but\\nstill retaining its hooked seeds, would form an endemic species, having as\\nuseless an appendage as any rudimentary organ,--for instance, as the\\nshrivelled wings under the soldered elytra of many insular beetles. again,\\nislands often possess trees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere\\ninclude only herbaceous species; now trees, as alph. de candolle has shown,\\ngenerally have, whatever the cause may be, confined ranges. hence trees\\nwould be little likely to reach distant oceanic islands; and an herbaceous\\nplant, though it would have no chance of {393} successfully competing in\\nstature with a fully developed tree, when established on an island and\\nhaving to compete with herbaceous plants alone, might readily gain an\\nadvantage by growing taller and taller and overtopping the other plants. if\\nso, natural selection would often tend to add to the stature of herbaceous\\nplants when growing on an oceanic island, to whatever order they belonged,\\nand thus convert them first into bushes and ultimately into trees.\\n\\nwith respect to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands, bory st.\\nvincent long ago remarked that batrachians (frogs, toads, newts) have never\\nbeen found on any of the many islands with which the great oceans are\\nstudded. i have taken pains to verify this assertion, and i have found it\\nstrictly true. i have, however, been assured that a frog exists on the\\nmountains of the great island of new zealand; but i suspect that this\\nexception (if the information be correct) may be explained through glacial\\nagency. this general absence of frogs, toads, and newts on so many oceanic\\nislands cannot be accounted for by their physical conditions; indeed it\\nseems that islands are peculiarly well fitted for these animals; for frogs\\nhave been introduced into madeira, the azores, and mauritius, and have\\nmultiplied so as to become a nuisance. but as these animals and their spawn\\nare known to be immediately killed by sea-water, on my view we can see that\\nthere would be great difficulty in their transportal across the sea, and\\ntherefore why they do not exist on any oceanic island. but why, on the\\ntheory of creation, they should not have been created there, it would be\\nvery difficult to explain.\\n\\nmammals offer another and similar case. i have carefully searched the\\noldest voyages, but have not finished my search; as yet i have not found a\\nsingle {394} instance, free from doubt, of a terrestrial mammal (excluding\\ndomesticated animals kept by the natives) inhabiting an island situated\\nabove 300 miles from a continent or great continental island; and many\\nislands situated at a much less distance are equally barren. the falkland\\nislands, which are inhabited by a wolf-like fox, come nearest to an\\nexception; but this group cannot be considered as oceanic, as it lies on a\\nbank connected with the mainland; moreover, icebergs formerly brought\\nboulders to its western shores, and they may have formerly transported\\nfoxes, as so frequently now happens in the arctic regions. yet it cannot be\\nsaid that small islands will not support small mammals, for they occur in\\nmany parts of the world on very small islands, if close to a continent; and\\nhardly an island can be named on which our smaller quadrupeds have not\\nbecome naturalised and greatly multiplied. it cannot be said, on the\\nordinary view of creation, that there has not been time for the creation of\\nmammals; many volcanic islands are sufficiently ancient, as shown by the\\nstupendous degradation which they have suffered and by their tertiary\\nstrata: there has also been time for the production of endemic species\\nbelonging to other classes; and on continents it is thought that mammals\\nappear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals. though\\nterrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands, aг«rial mammals do\\noccur on almost every island. new zealand possesses two bats found nowhere\\nelse in the world: norfolk island, the viti archipelago, the bonin islands,\\nthe caroline and marianne archipelagoes, and mauritius, all possess their\\npeculiar bats. why, it may be asked, has the supposed creative force\\nproduced bats and no other mammals on remote islands? on my view this\\nquestion can easily be answered; for no {395} terrestrial mammal can be\\ntransported across a wide space of sea, but bats can fly across. bats have\\nbeen seen wandering by day far over the atlantic ocean; and two north\\namerican species either regularly or occasionally visit bermuda, at the\\ndistance of 600 miles from the mainland. i hear from mr. tomes, who has\\nspecially studied this family, that many of the same species have enormous\\nranges, and are found on continents and on far distant islands. hence we\\nhave only to suppose that such wandering species have been modified through\\nnatural selection in their new homes in relation to their new position, and\\nwe can understand the presence of endemic bats on islands, with the absence\\nof all terrestrial mammals.\\n\\nbesides the absence of terrestrial mammals in relation to the remoteness of\\nislands from continents, there is also a relation, to a certain extent\\nindependent of distance, between the depth of the sea separating an island\\nfrom the neighbouring mainland, and the presence in both of the same\\nmammiferous species or of allied species in a more or less modified\\ncondition. mr. windsor earl has made some striking observations on this\\nhead in regard to the great malay archipelago, which is traversed near\\ncelebes by a space of deep ocean; and this space separates two widely\\ndistinct mammalian faunas. on either side the islands are situated on\\nmoderately deep submarine banks, and they are inhabited by closely allied\\nor identical quadrupeds. no doubt some few anomalies occur in this great\\narchipelago, and there is much difficulty in forming a judgment in some\\ncases owing to the probable naturalisation of certain mammals through man\\'s\\nagency; but we shall soon have much light thrown on the natural history of\\nthis archipelago by the admirable zeal and researches of mr. wallace. i\\nhave not as yet had time to {396} follow up this subject in all other\\nquarters of the world; but as far as i have gone, the relation generally\\nholds good. we see britain separated by a shallow channel from europe, and\\nthe mammals are the same on both sides; we meet with analogous facts on\\nmany islands separated by similar channels from australia. the west indian\\nislands stand on a deeply submerged bank, nearly 1000 fathoms in depth, and\\nhere we find american forms, but the species and even the genera are\\ndistinct. as the amount of modification in all cases depends to a certain\\ndegree on the lapse of time, and as during changes of level it is obvious\\nthat islands separated by shallow channels are more likely to have been\\ncontinuously united within a recent period to the mainland than islands\\nseparated by deeper channels, we can understand the frequent relation\\nbetween the depth of the sea and the degree of affinity of the mammalian\\ninhabitants of islands with those of a neighbouring continent,--an\\ninexplicable relation on the view of independent acts of creation.\\n\\nall the foregoing remarks on the inhabitants of oceanic islands,--namely,\\nthe scarcity of kinds--the richness in endemic forms in particular classes\\nor sections of classes,--the absence of whole groups, as of batrachians,\\nand of terrestrial mammals notwithstanding the presence of aг«rial\\nbats,--the singular proportions of certain orders of plants,--herbaceous\\nforms having been developed into trees, &c.,--seem to me to accord better\\nwith the view of occasional means of transport having been largely\\nefficient in the long course of time, than with the view of all our oceanic\\nislands having been formerly connected by continuous land with the nearest\\ncontinent; for on this latter view the migration would probably have been\\nmore complete; and if modification be admitted, all the forms of life would\\nhave been more {397} equally modified, in accordance with the paramount\\nimportance of the relation of organism to organism.\\n\\ni do not deny that there are many and grave difficulties in understanding\\nhow several of the inhabitants of the more remote islands, whether still\\nretaining the same specific form or modified since their arrival, could\\nhave reached their present homes. but the probability of many islands\\nhaving existed as halting-places, of which not a wreck now remains, must\\nnot be overlooked. i will here give a single instance of one of the cases\\nof difficulty. almost all oceanic islands, even the most isolated and\\nsmallest, are inhabited by land-shells, generally by endemic species, but\\nsometimes by species found elsewhere. dr. aug. a. gould has given several\\ninteresting cases in regard to the land-shells of the islands of the\\npacific. now it is notorious that land-shells are very easily killed by\\nsalt; their eggs, at least such as i have tried, sink in sea-water and are\\nkilled by it. yet there must be, on my view, some unknown, but highly\\nefficient means for their transportal. would the just-hatched young\\noccasionally crawl on and adhere to the feet of birds roosting on the\\nground, and thus get transported? it occurred to me that land-shells, when\\nhybernating and having a membranous diaphragm over the mouth of the shell,\\nmight be floated in chinks of drifted timber across moderately wide arms of\\nthe sea. and i found that several species did in this state withstand\\nuninjured an immersion in sea-water during seven days: one of these shells\\nwas the helix pomatia, and after it had again hybernated i put it in\\nsea-water for twenty days, and it perfectly recovered. as this species has\\na thick calcareous operculum, i removed it, and when it had formed a new\\nmembranous one, i immersed it for fourteen days in sea-water, and it\\nrecovered and crawled away: but more experiments are wanted on this head.\\n{398}\\n\\nthe most striking and important fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of\\nislands, is their affinity to those of the nearest mainland, without being\\nactually the same species. numerous instances could be given of this fact.\\ni will give only one, that of the galapagos archipelago, situated under the\\nequator, between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of south america. here\\nalmost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakeable stamp of\\nthe american continent. there are twenty-six land-birds, and twenty-five of\\nthese are ranked by mr. gould as distinct species, supposed to have been\\ncreated here; yet the close affinity of most of these birds to american\\nspecies in every character, in their habits, gestures, and tones of voice,\\nwas manifest. so it is with the other animals, and with nearly all the\\nplants, as shown by dr. hooker in his admirable memoir on the flora of this\\narchipelago. the naturalist, looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic\\nislands in the pacific, distant several hundred miles from the continent,\\nyet feels that he is standing on american land. why should this be so? why\\nshould the species which are supposed to have been created in the galapagos\\narchipelago, and nowhere else, bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those\\ncreated in america? there is nothing in the conditions of life, in the\\ngeological nature of the islands, in their height or climate, or in the\\nproportions in which the several classes are associated together, which\\nresembles closely the conditions of the south american coast: in fact there\\nis a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects. on the other hand,\\nthere is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the\\nsoil, in climate, height, and size of the islands, between the galapagos\\nand cape de verde archipelagos: but what an entire and absolute difference\\nin their inhabitants! the inhabitants of the cape de verde islands are\\nrelated to {399} those of africa, like those of the galapagos to america. i\\nbelieve this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary\\nview of independent creation; whereas on the view here maintained, it is\\nobvious that the galapagos islands would be likely to receive colonists,\\nwhether by occasional means of transport or by formerly continuous land,\\nfrom america; and the cape de verde islands from africa; and that such\\ncolonists would be liable to modification;--the principle of inheritance\\nstill betraying their original birthplace.\\n\\nmany analogous facts could be given: indeed it is an almost universal rule\\nthat the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the nearest\\ncontinent, or of other near islands. the exceptions are few, and most of\\nthem can be explained. thus the plants of kerguelen land, though standing\\nnearer to africa than to america, are related, and that very closely, as we\\nknow from dr. hooker\\'s account, to those of america: but on the view that\\nthis island has been mainly stocked by seeds brought with earth and stones\\non icebergs, drifted by the prevailing currents, this anomaly disappears.\\nnew zealand in its endemic plants is much more closely related to\\naustralia, the nearest mainland, than to any other region: and this is what\\nmight have been expected; but it is also plainly related to south america,\\nwhich, although the next nearest continent, is so enormously remote, that\\nthe fact becomes an anomaly. but this difficulty almost disappears on the\\nview that both new zealand, south america, and other southern lands were\\nlong ago partially stocked from a nearly intermediate though distant point,\\nnamely from the antarctic islands, when they were clothed with vegetation,\\nbefore the commencement of the glacial period. the affinity, which, though\\nfeeble, i am assured by dr. hooker is real, between the flora of the\\nsouth-western corner of australia and of the cape of good {400} hope, is a\\nfar more remarkable case, and is at present inexplicable: but this affinity\\nis confined to the plants, and will, i do not doubt, be some day explained.\\n\\nthe law which causes the inhabitants of an archipelago, though specifically\\ndistinct, to be closely allied to those of the nearest continent, we\\nsometimes see displayed on a small scale, yet in a most interesting manner,\\nwithin the limits of the same archipelago. thus the several islands of the\\ngalapagos archipelago are tenanted, as i have elsewhere shown, in a quite\\nmarvellous manner, by very closely related species; so that the inhabitants\\nof each separate island, though mostly distinct, are related in an\\nincomparably closer degree to each other than to the inhabitants of any\\nother part of the world. and this is just what might have been expected on\\nmy view, for the islands are situated so near each other that they would\\nalmost certainly receive immigrants from the same original source, or from\\neach other. but this dissimilarity between the endemic inhabitants of the\\nislands may be used as an argument against my views; for it may be asked,\\nhow has it happened in the several islands situated within sight of each\\nother, having the same geological nature, the same height, climate, &c.,\\nthat many of the immigrants should have been differently modified, though\\nonly in a small degree. this long appeared to me a great difficulty: but it\\narises in chief part from the deeply-seated error of considering the\\nphysical conditions of a country as the most important for its inhabitants;\\nwhereas it cannot, i think, be disputed that the nature of the other\\ninhabitants, with which each has to compete, is as least as important, and\\ngenerally a far more important element of success. now if we look to those\\ninhabitants of the galapagos archipelago which are found in other parts of\\nthe world (laying on one side for the moment the {401} endemic species,\\nwhich cannot be here fairly included, as we are considering how they have\\ncome to be modified since their arrival), we find a considerable amount of\\ndifference in the several islands. this difference might indeed have been\\nexpected on the view of the islands having been stocked by occasional means\\nof transport--a seed, for instance, of one plant having been brought to one\\nisland, and that of another plant to another island. hence when in former\\ntimes an immigrant settled on any one or more of the islands, or when it\\nsubsequently spread from one island to another, it would undoubtedly be\\nexposed to different conditions of life in the different islands, for it\\nwould have to compete with different sets of organisms: a plant for\\ninstance, would find the best-fitted ground more perfectly occupied by\\ndistinct plants in one island than in another, and it would be exposed to\\nthe attacks of somewhat different enemies. if then it varied, natural\\nselection would probably favour different varieties in the different\\nislands. some species, however, might spread and yet retain the same\\ncharacter throughout the group, just as we see on continents some species\\nspreading widely and remaining the same.\\n\\nthe really surprising fact in this case of the galapagos archipelago, and\\nin a lesser degree in some analogous instances, is that the new species\\nformed in the separate islands have not quickly spread to the other\\nislands. but the islands, though in sight of each other, are separated by\\ndeep arms of the sea, in most cases wider than the british channel, and\\nthere is no reason to suppose that they have at any former period been\\ncontinuously united. the currents of the sea are rapid and sweep across the\\narchipelago, and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare; so that the\\nislands are far more effectually separated from each other than they appear\\nto be on a map. nevertheless a good many {402} species, both those found in\\nother parts of the world and those confined to the archipelago, are common\\nto the several islands, and we may infer from certain facts that these have\\nprobably spread from some one island to the others. but we often take, i\\nthink, an erroneous view of the probability of closely-allied species\\ninvading each other\\'s territory, when put into free intercommunication.\\nundoubtedly if one species has any advantage whatever over another, it will\\nin a very brief time wholly or in part supplant it; but if both are equally\\nwell fitted for their own places in nature, both probably will hold their\\nown places and keep separate for almost any length of time. being familiar\\nwith the fact that many species, naturalised through man\\'s agency, have\\nspread with astonishing rapidity over new countries, we are apt to infer\\nthat most species would thus spread; but we should remember that the forms\\nwhich become naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied\\nto the aboriginal inhabitants, but are very distinct species, belonging in\\na large proportion of cases, as shown by alph. de candolle, to distinct\\ngenera. in the galapagos archipelago, many even of the birds, though so\\nwell adapted for flying from island to island, are distinct on each; thus\\nthere are three closely-allied species of mocking-thrush, each confined to\\nits own island. now let us suppose the mocking-thrush of chatham island to\\nbe blown to charles island, which has its own mocking-thrush: why should it\\nsucceed in establishing itself there? we may safely infer that charles\\nisland is well stocked with its own species, for annually more eggs are\\nlaid there than can possibly be reared; and we may infer that the\\nmocking-thrush peculiar to charles island is at least as well fitted for\\nits home as is the species peculiar to chatham island. sir c. lyell and mr.\\nwollaston have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this {403}\\nsubject; namely, that madeira and the adjoining islet of porto santo\\npossess many distinct but representative land-shells, some of which live in\\ncrevices of stone; and although large quantities of stone are annually\\ntransported from porto santo to madeira, yet this latter island has not\\nbecome colonised by the porto santo species: nevertheless both islands have\\nbeen colonised by some european land-shells, which no doubt had some\\nadvantage over the indigenous species. from these considerations i think we\\nneed not greatly marvel at the endemic and representative species, which\\ninhabit the several islands of the galapagos archipelago, not having\\nuniversally spread from island to island. in many other instances, as in\\nthe several districts of the same continent, pre-occupation has probably\\nplayed an important part in checking the commingling of species under the\\nsame conditions of life. thus, the south-east and south-west corners of\\naustralia have nearly the same physical conditions, and are united by\\ncontinuous land, yet they are inhabited by a vast number of distinct\\nmammals, birds, and plants.\\n\\nthe principle which determines the general character of the fauna and flora\\nof oceanic islands, namely, that the inhabitants, when not identically the\\nsame, yet are plainly related to the inhabitants of that region whence\\ncolonists could most readily have been derived,--the colonists having been\\nsubsequently modified and better fitted to their new homes,--is of the\\nwidest application throughout nature. we see this on every mountain, in\\nevery lake and marsh. for alpine species, excepting in so far as the same\\nforms, chiefly of plants, have spread widely throughout the world during\\nthe recent glacial epoch, are related to those of the surrounding\\nlowlands;--thus we have in south america, alpine humming-birds, alpine\\nrodents, alpine plants, {404} &c., all of strictly american forms, and it\\nis obvious that a mountain, as it became slowly upheaved, would naturally\\nbe colonised from the surrounding lowlands. so it is with the inhabitants\\nof lakes and marshes, excepting in so far as great facility of transport\\nhas given the same general forms to the whole world. we see this same\\nprinciple in the blind animals inhabiting the caves of america and of\\neurope. other analogous facts could be given. and it will, i believe, be\\nuniversally found to be true, that wherever in two regions, let them be\\never so distant, many closely-allied or representative species occur, there\\nwill likewise be found some identical species, showing, in accordance with\\nthe foregoing view, that at some former period there has been\\nintercommunication or migration between the two regions. and wherever many\\nclosely-allied species occur, there will be found many forms which some\\nnaturalists rank as distinct species, and some as varieties; these doubtful\\nforms showing us the steps in the process of modification.\\n\\nthis relation between the power and extent of migration of a species,\\neither at the present time or at some former period under different\\nphysical conditions, and the existence at remote points of the world of\\nother species allied to it, is shown in another and more general way. mr.\\ngould remarked to me long ago, that in those genera of birds which range\\nover the world, many of the species have very wide ranges. i can hardly\\ndoubt that this rule is generally true, though it would be difficult to\\nprove it. amongst mammals, we see it strikingly displayed in bats, and in a\\nlesser degree in the felidг¦ and canidг¦. we see it, if we compare the\\ndistribution of butterflies and beetles. so it is with most fresh-water\\nproductions, in which so many genera range over the world, and many\\nindividual species have {405} enormous ranges. it is not meant that in\\nworld-ranging genera all the species have a wide range, or even that they\\nhave on an _average_ a wide range; but only that some of the species range\\nvery widely; for the facility with which widely-ranging species vary and\\ngive rise to new forms will largely determine their average range. for\\ninstance, two varieties of the same species inhabit america and europe, and\\nthe species thus has an immense range; but, if the variation had been a\\nlittle greater, the two varieties would have been ranked as distinct\\nspecies, and the common range would have been greatly reduced. still less\\nis it meant, that a species which apparently has the capacity of crossing\\nbarriers and ranging widely, as in the case of certain powerfully-winged\\nbirds, will necessarily range widely; for we should never forget that to\\nrange widely implies not only the power of crossing barriers, but the more\\nimportant power of being victorious in distant lands in the struggle for\\nlife with foreign associates. but on the view of all the species of a genus\\nhaving descended from a single parent, though now distributed to the most\\nremote points of the world, we ought to find, and i believe as a general\\nrule we do find, that some at least of the species range very widely; for\\nit is necessary that the unmodified parent should range widely, undergoing\\nmodification during its diffusion, and should place itself under diverse\\nconditions favourable for the conversion of its offspring, firstly into new\\nvarieties and ultimately into new species.\\n\\nin considering the wide distribution of certain genera, we should bear in\\nmind that some are extremely ancient, and must have branched off from a\\ncommon parent at a remote epoch; so that in such cases there will have been\\nample time for great climatal and geographical changes and for accidents of\\ntransport; and consequently for the migration of some of the species into\\nall {406} quarters of the world, where they may have become slightly\\nmodified in relation to their new conditions. there is, also, some reason\\nto believe from geological evidence that organisms low in the scale within\\neach great class, generally change at a slower rate than the higher forms;\\nand consequently the lower forms will have had a better chance of ranging\\nwidely and of still retaining the same specific character. this fact,\\ntogether with the seeds and eggs of many low forms being very minute and\\nbetter fitted for distant transportation, probably accounts for a law which\\nhas long been observed, and which has lately been admirably discussed by\\nalph. de candolle in regard to plants, namely, that the lower any group of\\norganisms is, the more widely it is apt to range.\\n\\nthe relations just discussed,--namely, low and slowly-changing organisms\\nranging more widely than the high,--some of the species of widely-ranging\\ngenera themselves ranging widely,--such facts, as alpine, lacustrine, and\\nmarsh productions being related (with the exceptions before specified) to\\nthose on the surrounding low lands and dry lands, though these stations are\\nso different,--the very close relation of the distinct species which\\ninhabit the islets of the same archipelago,--and especially the striking\\nrelation of the inhabitants of each whole archipelago or island to those of\\nthe nearest mainland,--are, i think, utterly inexplicable on the ordinary\\nview of the independent creation of each species, but are explicable on the\\nview of colonisation from the nearest or readiest source, together with the\\nsubsequent modification and better adaptation of the colonists to their new\\nhomes.\\n\\n\\n\\n_summary of last and present chapters._--in these chapters i have\\nendeavoured to show, that if we make due allowance for our ignorance of the\\nfull effects of all {407} the changes of climate and of the level of the\\nland, which have certainly occurred within the recent period, and of other\\nsimilar changes which may have occurred within the same period; if we\\nremember how profoundly ignorant we are with respect to the many and\\ncurious means of occasional transport,--a subject which has hardly ever\\nbeen properly experimentised on; if we bear in mind how often a species may\\nhave ranged continuously over a wide area, and then have become extinct in\\nthe intermediate tracts, i think the difficulties in believing that all the\\nindividuals of the same species, wherever located, have descended from the\\nsame parents, are not insuperable. and we are led to this conclusion, which\\nhas been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single\\ncentres of creation, by some general considerations, more especially from\\nthe importance of barriers and from the analogical distribution of\\nsub-genera, genera, and families.\\n\\nwith respect to the distinct species of the same genus, which on my theory\\nmust have spread from one parent-source; if we make the same allowances as\\nbefore for our ignorance, and remember that some forms of life change most\\nslowly, enormous periods of time being thus granted for their migration, i\\ndo not think that the difficulties are insuperable; though they often are\\nin this case, and in that of the individuals of the same species, extremely\\ngreat.\\n\\nas exemplifying the effects of climatal changes on distribution, i have\\nattempted to show how important has been the influence of the modern\\nglacial period, which i am fully convinced simultaneously affected the\\nwhole world, or at least great meridional belts. as showing how diversified\\nare the means of occasional transport, i have discussed at some little\\nlength the means of dispersal of fresh-water productions. {408}\\n\\nif the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long course\\nof time the individuals of the same species, and likewise of allied\\nspecies, have proceeded from some one source; then i think all the grand\\nleading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of\\nmigration (generally of the more dominant forms of life), together with\\nsubsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms. we can thus\\nunderstand the high importance of barriers, whether of land or water, which\\nseparate our several zoological and botanical provinces. we can thus\\nunderstand the localisation of sub-genera, genera, and families; and how it\\nis that under different latitudes, for instance in south america, the\\ninhabitants of the plains and mountains, of the forests, marshes, and\\ndeserts, are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity, and are\\nlikewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same\\ncontinent. bearing in mind that the mutual relation of organism to organism\\nis of the highest importance, we can see why two areas having nearly the\\nsame physical conditions should often be inhabited by very different forms\\nof life; for according to the length of time which has elapsed since new\\ninhabitants entered one region; according to the nature of the\\ncommunication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter, either\\nin greater or lesser numbers; according or not, as those which entered\\nhappened to come in more or less direct competition with each other and\\nwith the aborigines; and according as the immigrants were capable of\\nvarying more or less rapidly, there would ensue in different regions,\\nindependently of their physical conditions, infinitely diversified\\nconditions of life,--there would be an almost endless amount of organic\\naction and reaction,--and we should find, as we do find, some groups of\\nbeings greatly, and some only slightly modified,--some {409} developed in\\ngreat force, some existing in scanty numbers--in the different great\\ngeographical provinces of the world.\\n\\non these same principles, we can understand, as i have endeavoured to show,\\nwhy oceanic islands should have few inhabitants, but of these a great\\nnumber should be endemic or peculiar; and why, in relation to the means of\\nmigration, one group of beings, even within the same class, should have all\\nits species endemic, and another group should have all its species common\\nto other quarters of the world. we can see why whole groups of organisms,\\nas batrachians and terrestrial mammals, should be absent from oceanic\\nislands, whilst the most isolated islands possess their own peculiar\\nspecies of aг«rial mammals or bats. we can see why there should be some\\nrelation between the presence of mammals, in a more or less modified\\ncondition, and the depth of the sea between an island and the mainland. we\\ncan clearly see why all the inhabitants of an archipelago, though\\nspecifically distinct on the several islets, should be closely related to\\neach other, and likewise be related, but less closely, to those of the\\nnearest continent or other source whence immigrants were probably derived.\\nwe can see why in two areas, however distant from each other, there should\\nbe a correlation, in the presence of identical species, of varieties, of\\ndoubtful species, and of distinct but representative species.\\n\\nas the late edward forbes often insisted, there is a striking parallelism\\nin the laws of life throughout time and space: the laws governing the\\nsuccession of forms in past times being nearly the same with those\\ngoverning at the present time the differences in different areas. we see\\nthis in many facts. the endurance of each species and group of species is\\ncontinuous in time; for the exceptions to the rule are so few, that they\\nmay {410} fairly be attributed to our not having as yet discovered in an\\nintermediate deposit the forms which are therein absent, but which occur\\nabove and below: so in space, it certainly is the general rule that the\\narea inhabited by a single species, or by a group of species, is\\ncontinuous; and the exceptions, which are not rare, may, as i have\\nattempted to show, be accounted for by migration at some former period\\nunder different conditions or by occasional means of transport, and by the\\nspecies having become extinct in the intermediate tracts. both in time and\\nspace, species and groups of species have their points of maximum\\ndevelopment. groups of species, belonging either to a certain period of\\ntime, or to a certain area, are often characterised by trifling characters\\nin common, as of sculpture or colour. in looking to the long succession of\\nages, as in now looking to distant provinces throughout the world, we find\\nthat some organisms differ little, whilst others belonging to a different\\nclass, or to a different order, or even only to a different family of the\\nsame order, differ greatly. in both time and space the lower members of\\neach class generally change less than the higher; but there are in both\\ncases marked exceptions to the rule. on my theory these several relations\\nthroughout time and space are intelligible; for whether we look to the\\nforms of life which have changed during successive ages within the same\\nquarter of the world, or to those which have changed after having migrated\\ninto distant quarters, in both cases the forms within each class have been\\nconnected by the same bond of ordinary generation; and the more nearly any\\ntwo forms are related in blood, the nearer they will generally stand to\\neach other in time and space; in both cases the laws of variation have been\\nthe same, and modifications have been accumulated by the same power of\\nnatural selection.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *

classification is evidently not arbitrary like the grouping of\\nthe stars in constellations. the existence of groups would have been of\\nsimple signification, if one group had been exclusively fitted to inhabit\\nthe land, and another the water; one to feed on flesh, another on vegetable\\nmatter, and so on; but the case is widely different in nature; for it is\\nnotorious how commonly members of even the same sub-group have different\\nhabits. in our second and fourth chapters, on variation and on natural\\nselection, i have attempted to show that it is the widely ranging, the much\\ndiffused and common, that is the dominant species belonging to the larger\\ngenera, which vary most. the varieties, or incipient species, thus produced\\nultimately become converted, as i believe, into new and distinct species;\\nand these, on the principle of inheritance, tend to produce other new and\\ndominant {412} species. consequently the groups which are now large, and\\nwhich generally include many dominant species, tend to go on increasing\\nindefinitely in size. i further attempted to show that from the varying\\ndescendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as different\\nplaces as possible in the economy of nature, there is a constant tendency\\nin their characters to diverge. this conclusion was supported by looking at\\nthe great diversity of the forms of life which, in any small area, come\\ninto the closest competition, and by looking to certain facts in\\nnaturalisation.\\n\\ni attempted also to show that there is a constant tendency in the forms\\nwhich are increasing in number and diverging in character, to supplant and\\nexterminate the less divergent, the less improved, and preceding forms. i\\nrequest the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action, as\\nformerly explained, of these several principles; and he will see that the\\ninevitable result is that the modified descendants proceeding from one\\nprogenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups. in the\\ndiagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus including\\nseveral species; and all the genera on this line form together one class,\\nfor all have descended from one ancient but unseen parent, and,\\nconsequently, have inherited something in common. but the three genera on\\nthe left hand have, on this same principle, much in common, and form a\\nsub-family, distinct from that including the next two genera on the right\\nhand, which diverged from a common parent at the fifth stage of descent.\\nthese five genera have also much, though less, in common; and they form a\\nfamily distinct from that including the three genera still further to the\\nright hand, which diverged at a still earlier period. and all these genera,\\ndescended from (a), form an order distinct from the {413} genera descended\\nfrom (i). so that we here have many species descended from a single\\nprogenitor grouped into genera; and the genera are included in, or\\nsubordinate to, sub-families, families, and orders, all united into one\\nclass. thus, the grand fact in natural history of the subordination of\\ngroup under group, which, from its familiarity, does not always\\nsufficiently strike us, is in my judgment explained.\\n\\nnaturalists try to arrange the species, genera, and families in each class,\\non what is called the natural system. but what is meant by this system?\\nsome authors look at it merely as a scheme for arranging together those\\nliving objects which are most alike, and for separating those which are\\nmost unlike; or as an artificial means for enunciating, as briefly as\\npossible, general propositions,--that is, by one sentence to give the\\ncharacters common, for instance, to all mammals, by another those common to\\nall carnivora, by another those common to the dog-genus, and then by adding\\na single sentence, a full description is given of each kind of dog. the\\ningenuity and utility of this system are indisputable. but many naturalists\\nthink that something more is meant by the natural system; they believe that\\nit reveals the plan of the creator; but unless it be specified whether\\norder in time or space, or what else is meant by the plan of the creator,\\nit seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge. such\\nexpressions as that famous one of linnг¦us, and which we often meet with in\\na more or less concealed form, that the characters do not make the genus,\\nbut that the genus gives the characters, seem to imply that something more\\nis included in our classification, than mere resemblance. i believe that\\nsomething more is included; and that propinquity of descent,--the only\\nknown cause of the similarity of organic beings,--is the bond, hidden as it\\nis by various degrees of {414} modification, which is partially revealed to\\nus by our classifications.\\n\\nlet us now consider the rules followed in classification, and the\\ndifficulties which are encountered on the view that classification either\\ngives some unknown plan of creation, or is simply a scheme for enunciating\\ngeneral propositions and of placing together the forms most like each\\nother. it might have been thought (and was in ancient times thought) that\\nthose parts of the structure which determined the habits of life, and the\\ngeneral place of each being in the economy of nature, would be of very high\\nimportance in classification. nothing can be more false. no one regards the\\nexternal similarity of a mouse to a shrew, of a dugong to a whale, of a\\nwhale to a fish, as of any importance. these resemblances, though so\\nintimately connected with the whole life of the being, are ranked as merely\\n\"adaptive or analogical characters;\" but to the consideration of these\\nresemblances we shall have to recur. it may even be given as a general\\nrule, that the less any part of the organisation is concerned with special\\nhabits, the more important it becomes for classification. as an instance:\\nowen, in speaking of the dugong, says, \"the generative organs being those\\nwhich are most remotely related to the habits and food of an animal, i have\\nalways regarded as affording very clear indications of its true affinities.\\nwe are least likely in the modifications of these organs to mistake a\\nmerely adaptive for an essential character.\" so with plants, how remarkable\\nit is that the organs of vegetation, on which their whole life depends, are\\nof little signification, excepting in the first main divisions; whereas the\\norgans of reproduction, with their product the seed, are of paramount\\nimportance!\\n\\nwe must not, therefore, in classifying, trust to resemblances in parts of\\nthe organisation, however important {415} they may be for the welfare of\\nthe being in relation to the outer world. perhaps from this cause it has\\npartly arisen, that almost all naturalists lay the greatest stress on\\nresemblances in organs of high vital or physiological importance. no doubt\\nthis view of the classificatory importance of organs which are important is\\ngenerally, but by no means always, true. but their importance for\\nclassification, i believe, depends on their greater constancy throughout\\nlarge groups of species; and this constancy depends on such organs having\\ngenerally been subjected to less change in the adaptation of the species to\\ntheir conditions of life. that the mere physiological importance of an\\norgan does not determine its classificatory value, is almost shown by the\\none fact, that in allied groups, in which the same organ, as we have every\\nreason to suppose, has nearly the same physiological value, its\\nclassificatory value is widely different. no naturalist can have worked at\\nany group without being struck with this fact; and it has been fully\\nacknowledged in the writings of almost every author. it will suffice to\\nquote the highest authority, robert brown, who in speaking of certain\\norgans in the proteaceг¦, says their generic importance, \"like that of all\\ntheir parts, not only in this but, as i apprehend, in every natural family,\\nis very unequal, and in some cases seems to be entirely lost.\" again in\\nanother work he says, the genera of the connaraceг¦ \"differ in having one or\\nmore ovaria, in the existence or absence of albumen, in the imbricate or\\nvalvular г¦stivation. any one of these characters singly is frequently of\\nmore than generic importance, though here even when all taken together they\\nappear insufficient to separate cnestis from connarus.\" to give an example\\namongst insects, in one great division of the hymenoptera, the antennг¦, as\\nwestwood has remarked, are most constant in structure; {416} in another\\ndivision they differ much, and the differences are of quite subordinate\\nvalue in classification; yet no one probably will say that the antennae in\\nthese two divisions of the same order are of unequal physiological\\nimportance. any number of instances could be given of the varying\\nimportance for classification of the same important organ within the same\\ngroup of beings.\\n\\nagain, no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high\\nphysiological or vital importance; yet, undoubtedly, organs in this\\ncondition are often of high value in classification. no one will dispute\\nthat the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants, and\\ncertain rudimentary bones of the leg, are highly serviceable in exhibiting\\nthe close affinity between ruminants and pachyderms. robert brown has\\nstrongly insisted on the fact that the rudimentary florets are of the\\nhighest importance in the classification of the grasses.\\n\\nnumerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts which\\nmust be considered of very trifling physiological importance, but which are\\nuniversally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition of whole\\ngroups. for instance, whether or not there is an open passage from the\\nnostrils to the mouth, the only character, according to owen, which\\nabsolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles--the inflection of the angle\\nof the jaws in marsupials--the manner in which the wings of insects are\\nfolded--mere colour in certain algг¦--mere pubescence on parts of the flower\\nin grasses--the nature of the dermal covering, as hair or feathers, in the\\nvertebrata. if the ornithorhynchus had been covered with feathers instead\\nof hair, this external and trifling character would, i think, have been\\nconsidered by naturalists as important an aid in determining the degree of\\naffinity of this strange creature to {417} birds and reptiles, as an\\napproach in structure in any one internal and important organ.\\n\\nthe importance, for classification, of trifling characters, mainly depends\\non their being correlated with several other characters of more or less\\nimportance. the value indeed of an aggregate of characters is very evident\\nin natural history. hence, as has often been remarked, a species may depart\\nfrom its allies in several characters, both of high physiological\\nimportance and of almost universal prevalence, and yet leave us in no doubt\\nwhere it should be ranked. hence, also, it has been found, that a\\nclassification founded on any single character, however important that may\\nbe, has always failed; for no part of the organisation is universally\\nconstant. the importance of an aggregate of characters, even when none are\\nimportant, alone explains, i think, that saying of linnг¦us, that the\\ncharacters do not give the genus, but the genus gives the characters; for\\nthis saying seems founded on an appreciation of many trifling points of\\nresemblance, too slight to be defined. certain plants, belonging to the\\nmalpighiaceг¦, bear perfect and degraded flowers; in the latter, as a. de\\njussieu has remarked, \"the greater number of the characters proper to the\\nspecies, to the genus, to the family, to the class, disappear, and thus\\nlaugh at our classification.\" but when aspicarpa produced in france, during\\nseveral years, only degraded flowers, departing so wonderfully in a number\\nof the most important points of structure from the proper type of the\\norder, yet m. richard sagaciously saw, as jussieu observes, that this genus\\nshould still be retained amongst the malpighiaceг¦. this case seems to me\\nwell to illustrate the spirit with which our classifications are sometimes\\nnecessarily founded.\\n\\npractically when naturalists are at work, they do {418} not trouble\\nthemselves about the physiological value of the characters which they use\\nin defining a group, or in allocating any particular species. if they find\\na character nearly uniform, and common to a great number of forms, and not\\ncommon to others, they use it as one of high value; if common to some\\nlesser number, they use it as of subordinate value. this principle has been\\nbroadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one; and by none more\\nclearly than by that excellent botanist, aug. st. hilaire. if certain\\ncharacters are always found correlated with others, though no apparent bond\\nof connexion can be discovered between them, especial value is set on them.\\nas in most groups of animals, important organs, such as those for\\npropelling the blood, or for aг«rating it, or those for propagating the\\nrace, are found nearly uniform, they are considered as highly serviceable\\nin classification; but in some groups of animals all these, the most\\nimportant vital organs, are found to offer characters of quite subordinate\\nvalue.\\n\\nwe can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal\\nimportance with those derived from the adult, for our classifications of\\ncourse include all ages of each species. but it is by no means obvious, on\\nthe ordinary view, why the structure of the embryo should be more important\\nfor this purpose than that of the adult, which alone plays its full part in\\nthe economy of nature. yet it has been strongly urged by those great\\nnaturalists, milne edwards and agassiz, that embryonic characters are the\\nmost important of any in the classification of animals; and this doctrine\\nhas very generally been admitted as true. the same fact holds good with\\nflowering plants, of which the two main divisions have been founded on\\ncharacters derived from the embryo,--on the number and position of the\\n{419} embryonic leaves or cotyledons, and on the mode of development of the\\nplumule and radicle. in our discussion on embryology, we shall see why such\\ncharacters are so valuable, on the view of classification tacitly including\\nthe idea of descent.\\n\\nour classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of affinities.\\nnothing can be easier than to define a number of characters common to all\\nbirds; but in the case of crustaceans, such definition has hitherto been\\nfound impossible. there are crustaceans at the opposite ends of the series,\\nwhich have hardly a character in common; yet the species at both ends, from\\nbeing plainly allied to others, and these to others, and so onwards, can be\\nrecognised as unequivocally belonging to this, and to no other class of the\\narticulata.\\n\\ngeographical distribution has often been used, though perhaps not quite\\nlogically, in classification, more especially in very large groups of\\nclosely allied forms. temminck insists on the utility or even necessity of\\nthis practice in certain groups of birds; and it has been followed by\\nseveral entomologists and botanists.\\n\\nfinally, with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of\\nspecies, such as orders, sub-orders, families, sub-families, and genera,\\nthey seem to be, at least at present, almost arbitrary. several of the best\\nbotanists, such as mr. bentham and others, have strongly insisted on their\\narbitrary value. instances could be given amongst plants and insects, of a\\ngroup of forms, first ranked by practised naturalists as only a genus, and\\nthen raised to the rank of a sub-family or family; and this has been done,\\nnot because further research has detected important structural differences,\\nat first overlooked, but because numerous allied species, with slightly\\ndifferent grades of difference, have been subsequently discovered. {420}\\n\\nall the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are\\nexplained, if i do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural\\nsystem is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which\\nnaturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more\\nspecies, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in\\nso far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent\\nis the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking, and\\nnot some unknown plan of creation, or the enunciation of general\\npropositions, and the mere putting together and separating objects more or\\nless alike.\\n\\nbut i must explain my meaning more fully. i believe that the _arrangement_\\nof the groups within each class, in due subordination and relation to the\\nother groups, must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural; but\\nthat the _amount_ of difference in the several branches or groups, though\\nallied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor, may differ\\ngreatly, being due to the different degrees of modification which they have\\nundergone; and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different\\ngenera, families, sections, or orders. the reader will best understand what\\nis meant, if he will take the trouble of referring to the diagram in the\\nfourth chapter. we will suppose the letters a to l to represent allied\\ngenera, which lived during the silurian epoch, and these have descended\\nfrom a species which existed at an unknown anterior period. species of\\nthree of these genera (a, f, and i) have transmitted modified descendants\\nto the present day, represented by the fifteen genera (a^{14} to z^{14}) on\\nthe uppermost horizontal line. now all these modified descendants from a\\nsingle species, are represented as related in blood or descent to the same\\n{421} degree; they may metaphorically be called cousins to the same\\nmillionth degree; yet they differ widely and in different degrees from each\\nother. the forms descended from a, now broken up into two or three\\nfamilies, constitute a distinct order from those descended from i, also\\nbroken up into two families. nor can the existing species, descended from\\na, be ranked in the same genus with the parent a; or those from i, with the\\nparent i. but the existing genus f^{14} may be supposed to have been but\\nslightly modified; and it will then rank with the parent-genus f; just as\\nsome few still living organic beings belong to silurian genera. so that the\\namount or value of the differences between organic beings all related to\\neach other in the same degree in blood, has come to be widely different.\\nnevertheless their genealogical _arrangement_ remains strictly true, not\\nonly at the present time, but at each successive period of descent. all the\\nmodified descendants from a will have inherited something in common from\\ntheir common parent, as will all the descendants from i; so will it be with\\neach subordinate branch of descendants, at each successive period. if,\\nhowever, we choose to suppose that any of the descendants of a or of i have\\nbeen so much modified as to have more or less completely lost traces of\\ntheir parentage, in this case, their places in a natural classification\\nwill have been more or less completely lost,--as sometimes seems to have\\noccurred with existing organisms. all the descendants of the genus f, along\\nits whole line of descent, are supposed to have been but little modified,\\nand they yet form a single genus. but this genus, though much isolated,\\nwill still occupy its proper intermediate position; for f originally was\\nintermediate in character between a and i, and the several genera descended\\nfrom these two genera will {422} have inherited to a certain extent their\\ncharacters. this natural arrangement is shown, as far as is possible on\\npaper, in the diagram, but in much too simple a manner. if a branching\\ndiagram had not been used, and only the names of the groups had been\\nwritten in a linear series, it would have been still less possible to have\\ngiven a natural arrangement; and it is notoriously not possible to\\nrepresent in a series, on a flat surface, the affinities which we discover\\nin nature amongst the beings of the same group. thus, on the view which i\\nhold, the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement, like a\\npedigree; but the degrees of modification which the different groups have\\nundergone, have to be expressed by ranking them under different so-called\\ngenera, sub-families, families, sections, orders, and classes.\\n\\nit may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification, by taking\\nthe case of languages. if we possessed a perfect pedigree of mankind, a\\ngenealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the best\\nclassification of the various languages now spoken throughout the world;\\nand if all extinct languages, and all intermediate and slowly changing\\ndialects, had to be included, such an arrangement would, i think, be the\\nonly possible one. yet it might be that some very ancient language had\\naltered little, and had given rise to few new languages, whilst others\\n(owing to the spreading and subsequent isolation and states of civilisation\\nof the several races, descended from a common race) had altered much, and\\nhad given rise to many new languages and dialects. the various degrees of\\ndifference in the languages from the same stock, would have to be expressed\\nby groups subordinate to groups; but the proper or even only possible\\narrangement would still be genealogical; and this would be strictly\\nnatural, as {423} it would connect together all languages, extinct and\\nmodern, by the closest affinities, and would give the filiation and origin\\nof each tongue.\\n\\nin confirmation of this view, let us glance at the classification of\\nvarieties, which are believed or known to have descended from one species.\\nthese are grouped under species, with sub-varieties under varieties; and\\nwith our domestic productions, several other grades of difference are\\nrequisite, as we have seen with pigeons. the origin of the existence of\\ngroups subordinate to groups, is the same with varieties as with species,\\nnamely, closeness of descent with various degrees of modification. nearly\\nthe same rules are followed in classifying varieties, as with species.\\nauthors have insisted on the necessity of classing varieties on a natural\\ninstead of an artificial system; we are cautioned, for instance, not to\\nclass two varieties of the pine-apple together, merely because their fruit,\\nthough the most important part, happens to be nearly identical; no one puts\\nthe swedish and common turnips together, though the esculent and thickened\\nstems are so similar. whatever part is found to be most constant, is used\\nin classing varieties: thus the great agriculturist marshall says the horns\\nare very useful for this purpose with cattle, because they are less\\nvariable than the shape or colour of the body, &c.; whereas with sheep the\\nhorns are much less serviceable, because less constant. in classing\\nvarieties, i apprehend if we had a real pedigree, a genealogical\\nclassification would be universally preferred; and it has been attempted by\\nsome authors. for we might feel sure, whether there had been more or less\\nmodification, the principle of inheritance would keep the forms together\\nwhich were allied in the greatest number of points. in tumbler pigeons,\\nthough some sub-varieties differ from the others {424} in the important\\ncharacter of having a longer beak, yet all are kept together from having\\nthe common habit of tumbling; but the short-faced breed has nearly or quite\\nlost this habit; nevertheless, without any reasoning or thinking on the\\nsubject, these tumblers are kept in the same group, because allied in blood\\nand alike in some other respects. if it could be proved that the hottentot\\nhad descended from the negro, i think he would be classed under the negro\\ngroup, however much he might differ in colour and other important\\ncharacters from negroes.\\n\\nwith species in a state of nature, every naturalist has in fact brought\\ndescent into his classification; for he includes in his lowest grade, or\\nthat of a species, the two sexes; and how enormously these sometimes differ\\nin the most important characters, is known to every naturalist: scarcely a\\nsingle fact can be predicated in common of the males and hermaphrodites of\\ncertain cirripedes, when adult, and yet no one dreams of separating them.\\nthe naturalist includes as one species the several larval stages of the\\nsame individual, however much they may differ from each other and from the\\nadult; as he likewise includes the so-called alternate generations of\\nsteenstrup, which can only in a technical sense be considered as the same\\nindividual. he includes monsters; he includes varieties, not solely because\\nthey closely resemble the parent-form, but because they are descended from\\nit. he who believes that the cowslip is descended from the primrose, or\\nconversely, ranks them together as a single species, and gives a single\\ndefinition. as soon as three orchidean forms (monochanthus, myanthus, and\\ncatasetum), which had previously been ranked as three distinct genera, were\\nknown to be sometimes produced on the same spike, they were immediately\\nincluded as a single species. {425}\\n\\nas descent has universally been used in classing together the individuals\\nof the same species, though the males and females and larvг¦ are sometimes\\nextremely different; and as it has been used in classing varieties which\\nhave undergone a certain, and sometimes a considerable amount of\\nmodification, may not this same element of descent have been unconsciously\\nused in grouping species under genera, and genera under higher groups,\\nthough in these cases the modification has been greater in degree, and has\\ntaken a longer time to complete? i believe it has thus been unconsciously\\nused; and only thus can i understand the several rules and guides which\\nhave been followed by our best systematists. we have no written pedigrees;\\nwe have to make out community of descent by resemblances of any kind.\\ntherefore we choose those characters which, as far as we can judge, are the\\nleast likely to have been modified in relation to the conditions of life to\\nwhich each species has been recently exposed. rudimentary structures on\\nthis view are as good as, or even sometimes better than, other parts of the\\norganisation. we care not how trifling a character may be--let it be the\\nmere inflection of the angle of the jaw, the manner in which an insect\\'s\\nwing is folded, whether the skin be covered by hair or feathers--if it\\nprevail throughout many and different species, especially those having very\\ndifferent habits of life, it assumes high value; for we can account for its\\npresence in so many forms with such different habits, only by its\\ninheritance from a common parent. we may err in this respect in regard to\\nsingle points of structure, but when several characters, let them be ever\\nso trifling, occur together throughout a large group of beings having\\ndifferent habits, we may feel almost sure, on the theory of descent, that\\nthese characters have been inherited from a common ancestor. {426} and we\\nknow that such correlated or aggregated characters have especial value in\\nclassification.\\n\\nwe can understand why a species or a group of species may depart, in\\nseveral of its most important characteristics, from its allies, and yet be\\nsafely classed with them. this may be safely done, and is often done, as\\nlong as a sufficient number of characters, let them be ever so unimportant,\\nbetrays the hidden bond of community of descent. let two forms have not a\\nsingle character in common, yet if these extreme forms are connected\\ntogether by a chain of intermediate groups, we may at once infer their\\ncommunity of descent, and we put them all into the same class. as we find\\norgans of high physiological importance--those which serve to preserve life\\nunder the most diverse conditions of existence--are generally the most\\nconstant, we attach especial value to them; but if these same organs, in\\nanother group or section of a group, are found to differ much, we at once\\nvalue them less in our classification. we shall hereafter, i think, clearly\\nsee why embryological characters are of such high classificatory\\nimportance. geographical distribution may sometimes be brought usefully\\ninto play in classing large and widely-distributed genera, because all the\\nspecies of the same genus, inhabiting any distinct and isolated region,\\nhave in all probability descended from the same parents.\\n\\nwe can understand, on these views, the very important distinction between\\nreal affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances. lamarck first\\ncalled attention to this distinction, and he has been ably followed by\\nmacleay and others. the resemblance, in the shape of the body and in the\\nfin-like anterior limbs, between the dugong, which is a pachydermatous\\nanimal, and the whale, and between both these mammals and fishes, is\\nanalogical. amongst insects there are innumerable {427} instances: thus\\nlinnг¦us, misled by external appearances, actually classed an homopterous\\ninsect as a moth. we see something of the same kind even in our domestic\\nvarieties, as in the thickened stems of the common and swedish turnip. the\\nresemblance of the greyhound and racehorse is hardly more fanciful than the\\nanalogies which have been drawn by some authors between very distinct\\nanimals. on my view of characters being of real importance for\\nclassification, only in so far as they reveal descent, we can clearly\\nunderstand why analogical or adaptive character, although of the utmost\\nimportance to the welfare of the being, are almost valueless to the\\nsystematist. for animals, belonging to two most distinct lines of descent,\\nmay readily become adapted to similar conditions, and thus assume a close\\nexternal resemblance; but such resemblances will not reveal--will rather\\ntend to conceal their blood-relationship to their proper lines of descent.\\nwe can also understand the apparent paradox, that the very same characters\\nare analogical when one class or order is compared with another, but give\\ntrue affinities when the members of the same class or order are compared\\none with another: thus the shape of the body and fin-like limbs are only\\nanalogical when whales are compared with fishes, being adaptations in both\\nclasses for swimming through the water; but the shape of the body and\\nfin-like limbs serve as characters exhibiting true affinity between the\\nseveral members of the whale family; for these cetaceans agree in so many\\ncharacters, great and small, that we cannot doubt that they have inherited\\ntheir general shape of body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor.\\nso it is with fishes.\\n\\nas members of distinct classes have often been adapted by successive slight\\nmodifications to live under nearly similar circumstances,--to inhabit for\\ninstance {428} the three elements of land, air, and water,--we can perhaps\\nunderstand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimes been\\nobserved between the sub-groups in distinct classes. a naturalist, struck\\nby a parallelism of this nature in any one class, by arbitrarily raising or\\nsinking the value of the groups in other classes (and all our experience\\nshows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary), could easily extend\\nthe parallelism over a wide range; and thus the septenary, quinary,\\nquaternary, and ternary classifications have probably arisen.\\n\\nas the modified descendants of dominant species, belonging to the larger\\ngenera, tend to inherit the advantages, which made the groups to which they\\nbelong large and their parents dominant, they are almost sure to spread\\nwidely, and to seize on more and more places in the economy of nature. the\\nlarger and more dominant groups thus tend to go on increasing in size; and\\nthey consequently supplant many smaller and feebler groups. thus we can\\naccount for the fact that all organisms, recent and extinct, are included\\nunder a few great orders, under still fewer classes, and all in one great\\nnatural system. as showing how few the higher groups are in number, and how\\nwidely spread they are throughout the world, the fact is striking, that the\\ndiscovery of australia has not added a single insect belonging to a new\\nclass; and that in the vegetable kingdom, as i learn from dr. hooker, it\\nhas added only two or three orders of small size.\\n\\nin the chapter on geological succession i attempted to show, on the\\nprinciple of each group having generally diverged much in character during\\nthe long-continued process of modification, how it is that the more ancient\\nforms of life often present characters in some slight degree intermediate\\nbetween existing groups. a few {429} old and intermediate parent-forms\\nhaving occasionally transmitted to the present day descendants but little\\nmodified, will give to us our so-called osculant or aberrant groups. the\\nmore aberrant any form is, the greater must be the number of connecting\\nforms which on my theory have been exterminated and utterly lost. and we\\nhave some evidence of aberrant forms having suffered severely from\\nextinction, for they are generally represented by extremely few species;\\nand such species as do occur are generally very distinct from each other,\\nwhich again implies extinction. the genera ornithorhynchus and lepidosiren,\\nfor example, would not have been less aberrant had each been represented by\\na dozen species instead of by a single one; but such richness in species,\\nas i find after some investigation, does not commonly fall to the lot of\\naberrant genera. we can, i think, account for this fact only by looking at\\naberrant forms as failing groups conquered by more successful competitors,\\nwith a few members preserved by some unusual coincidence of favourable\\ncircumstances.\\n\\nmr. waterhouse has remarked that, when a member belonging to one group of\\nanimals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group, this affinity in\\nmost cases is general and not special: thus, according to mr. waterhouse,\\nof all rodents, the bizcacha is most nearly related to marsupials; but in\\nthe points in which it approaches this order, its relations are general,\\nand not to any one marsupial species more than to another. as the points of\\naffinity of the bizcacha to marsupials are believed to be real and not\\nmerely adaptive, they are due on my theory to inheritance in common.\\ntherefore we must suppose either that all rodents, including the bizcacha,\\nbranched off from some very ancient marsupial, which will have had a\\ncharacter in some degree intermediate with respect to all existing\\nmarsupials; or {430} that both rodents and marsupials branched off from a\\ncommon progenitor, and that both groups have since undergone much\\nmodification in divergent directions. on either view we may suppose that\\nthe bizcacha has retained, by inheritance, more of the character of its\\nancient progenitor than have other rodents; and therefore it will not be\\nspecially related to any one existing marsupial, but indirectly to all or\\nnearly all marsupials, from having partially retained the character of\\ntheir common progenitor, or of an early member of the group. on the other\\nhand, of all marsupials, as mr. waterhouse has remarked, the phascolomys\\nresembles most nearly, not any one species, but the general order of\\nrodents. in this case, however, it may be strongly suspected that the\\nresemblance is only analogical, owing to the phascolomys having become\\nadapted to habits like those of a rodent. the elder de candolle has made\\nnearly similar observations on the general nature of the affinities of\\ndistinct orders of plants.\\n\\non the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in character\\nof the species descended from a common parent, together with their\\nretention by inheritance of some characters in common, we can understand\\nthe excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all the members\\nof the same family or higher group are connected together. for the common\\nparent of a whole family of species, now broken up by extinction into\\ndistinct groups and sub-groups, will have transmitted some of its\\ncharacters, modified in various ways and degrees, to all; and the several\\nspecies will consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines of\\naffinity of various lengths (as may be seen in the diagram so often\\nreferred to), mounting up through many predecessors. as it is difficult to\\nshow the blood-relationship between the numerous kindred {431} of any\\nancient and noble family, even by the aid of a genealogical tree, and\\nalmost impossible to do this without this aid, we can understand the\\nextraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in describing,\\nwithout the aid of a diagram, the various affinities which they perceive\\nbetween the many living and extinct members of the same great natural\\nclass.\\n\\nextinction, as we have seen in the fourth chapter, has played an important\\npart in defining and widening the intervals between the several groups in\\neach class. we may thus account even for the distinctness of whole classes\\nfrom each other--for instance, of birds from all other vertebrate\\nanimals--by the belief that many ancient forms of life have been utterly\\nlost, through which the early progenitors of birds were formerly connected\\nwith the early progenitors of the other vertebrate classes. there has been\\nless entire extinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes\\nwith batrachians. there has been still less in some other classes, as in\\nthat of the crustacea, for here the most wonderfully diverse forms are\\nstill tied together by a long, but broken, chain of affinities. extinction\\nhas only separated groups: it has by no means made them; for if every form\\nwhich has ever lived on this earth were suddenly to reappear, though it\\nwould be quite impossible to give definitions by which each group could be\\ndistinguished from other groups, as all would blend together by steps as\\nfine as those between the finest existing varieties, nevertheless a natural\\nclassification, or at least a natural arrangement, would be possible. we\\nshall see this by turning to the diagram: the letters, a to l, may\\nrepresent eleven silurian genera, some of which have produced large groups\\nof modified descendants. every intermediate link between these eleven\\ngenera and their primordial parent, and every {432} intermediate link in\\neach branch and sub-branch of their descendants, may be supposed to be\\nstill alive; and the links to be as fine as those between the finest\\nvarieties. in this case it would be quite impossible to give any definition\\nby which the several members of the several groups could be distinguished\\nfrom their more immediate parents; or these parents from their ancient and\\nunknown progenitor. yet the natural arrangement in the diagram would still\\nhold good; and, on the principle of inheritance, all the forms descended\\nfrom a, or from i, would have something in common. in a tree we can specify\\nthis or that branch, though at the actual fork the two unite and blend\\ntogether. we could not, as i have said, define the several groups; but we\\ncould pick out types, or forms, representing most of the characters of each\\ngroup, whether large or small, and thus give a general idea of the value of\\nthe differences between them. this is what we should be driven to, if we\\nwere ever to succeed in collecting all the forms in any class which have\\nlived throughout all time and space. we shall certainly never succeed in\\nmaking so perfect a collection: nevertheless, in certain classes, we are\\ntending in this direction; and milne edwards has lately insisted, in an\\nable paper, on the high importance of looking to types, whether or not we\\ncan separate and define the groups to which such types belong.\\n\\nfinally, we have seen that natural selection, which results from the\\nstruggle for existence, and which almost inevitably induces extinction and\\ndivergence of character in the many descendants from one dominant\\nparent-species, explains that great and universal feature in the affinities\\nof all organic beings, namely, their subordination in group under group. we\\nuse the element of descent in classing the individuals of both sexes and of\\nall ages, although having few characters in common, {433} under one\\nspecies; we use descent in classing acknowledged varieties, however\\ndifferent they may be from their parent; and i believe this element of\\ndescent is the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have sought under\\nthe term of the natural system. on this idea of the natural system being,\\nin so far as it has been perfected, genealogical in its arrangement, with\\nthe grades of difference between the descendants from a common parent,\\nexpressed by the terms genera, families, orders, &c., we can understand the\\nrules which we are compelled to follow in our classification. we can\\nunderstand why we value certain resemblances far more than others; why we\\nare permitted to use rudimentary and useless organs, or others of trifling\\nphysiological importance; why, in comparing one group with a distinct\\ngroup, we summarily reject analogical or adaptive characters, and yet use\\nthese same characters within the limits of the same group. we can clearly\\nsee how it is that all living and extinct forms can be grouped together in\\none great system; and how the several members of each class are connected\\ntogether by the most complex and radiating lines of affinities. we shall\\nnever, probably, disentangle the inextricable web of affinities between the\\nmembers of any one class; but when we have a distinct object in view, and\\ndo not look to some unknown plan of creation, we may hope to make sure but\\nslow progress.\\n\\n\\n\\n_morphology._--we have seen that the members of the same class,\\nindependently of their habits of life, resemble each other in the general\\nplan of their organisation. this resemblance is often expressed by the term\\n\"unity of type;\" or by saying that the several parts and organs in the\\ndifferent species of the class are homologous. the whole subject is\\nincluded under {434} the general name of morphology. this is the most\\ninteresting department of natural history, and may be said to be its very\\nsoul. what can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for\\ngrasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of\\nthe porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the\\nsame pattern, and should include similar bones, in the same relative\\npositions? geoffroy st. hilaire has insisted strongly on the high\\nimportance of relative connexion in homologous organs: the parts may change\\nto almost any extent in form and size, and yet they always remain connected\\ntogether in the same order. we never find, for instance, the bones of the\\narm and forearm, or of the thigh and leg, transposed. hence the same names\\ncan be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals. we see\\nthe same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects: what can\\nbe more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a\\nsphinx-moth, the curious folded one of a bee or bug, and the great jaws of\\na beetle?--yet all these organs, serving for such different purposes, are\\nformed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip, mandibles, and\\ntwo pairs of maxillг¦. analogous laws govern the construction of the mouths\\nand limbs of crustaceans. so it is with the flowers of plants.\\n\\nnothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity of\\npattern in members of the same class, by utility or by the doctrine of\\nfinal causes. the hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly admitted\\nby owen in his most interesting work on the \\'nature of limbs.\\' on the\\nordinary view of the independent creation of each being, we can only say\\nthat so it is;--that it has so pleased the creator to construct each animal\\nand plant.\\n\\nthe explanation is manifest on the theory of the {435} natural selection of\\nsuccessive slight modifications,--each modification being profitable in\\nsome way to the modified form, but often affecting by correlation of growth\\nother parts of the organisation. in changes of this nature, there will be\\nlittle or no tendency to modify the original pattern, or to transpose\\nparts. the bones of a limb might be shortened and widened to any extent,\\nand become gradually enveloped in thick membrane, so as to serve as a fin;\\nor a webbed foot might have all its bones, or certain bones, lengthened to\\nany extent, and the membrane connecting them increased to any extent, so as\\nto serve as a wing: yet in all this great amount of modification there will\\nbe no tendency to alter the framework of bones or the relative connexion of\\nthe several parts. if we suppose that the ancient progenitor, the archetype\\nas it may be called, of all mammals, had its limbs constructed on the\\nexisting general pattern, for whatever purpose they served, we can at once\\nperceive the plain signification of the homologous construction of the\\nlimbs throughout the whole class. so with the mouths of insects, we have\\nonly to suppose that their common progenitor had an upper lip, mandibles,\\nand two pair of maxillг¦, these parts being perhaps very simple in form; and\\nthen natural selection, acting on some originally created form, will\\naccount for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the mouths\\nof insects. nevertheless, it is conceivable that the general pattern of an\\norgan might become so much obscured as to be finally lost, by the atrophy\\nand ultimately by the complete abortion of certain parts, by the soldering\\ntogether of other parts, and by the doubling or multiplication of\\nothers,--variations which we know to be within the limits of possibility.\\nin the paddles of the extinct gigantic sea-lizards, and in the mouths of\\ncertain suctorial crustaceans, the {436} general pattern seems to have been\\nthus to a certain extent obscured.\\n\\nthere is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely,\\nthe comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of\\nthe different parts or organs in the same individual. most physiologists\\nbelieve that the bones of the skull are homologous with--that is correspond\\nin number and in relative connexion with--the elemental parts of a certain\\nnumber of vertebrг¦. the anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the\\nvertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. we see the same\\nlaw in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. it\\nis familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of\\nthe sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate\\nstructure, are intelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed\\nleaves, arranged in a spire. in monstrous plants, we often get direct\\nevidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another;\\nand we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals,\\nand in flowers, that organs, which when mature become extremely different,\\nare at an early stage of growth exactly alike.\\n\\nhow inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! why\\nshould the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such\\nextraordinary shaped pieces of bone? as owen has remarked, the benefit\\nderived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition\\nof mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of\\nbirds. why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the\\nwing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different\\npurposes? why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex {437}\\nmouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or\\nconversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? why should the\\nsepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though\\nfitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same\\npattern?\\n\\non the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these\\nquestions. in the vertebrata, we see a series of internal vertebrг¦ bearing\\ncertain processes and appendages; in the articulata, we see the body\\ndivided into a series of segments, bearing external appendages; and in\\nflowering plants, we see a series of successive spiral whorls of leaves. an\\nindefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common\\ncharacteristic (as owen has observed) of all low or little-modified forms;\\ntherefore we may readily believe that the unknown progenitor of the\\nvertebrata possessed many vertebrг¦; the unknown progenitor of the\\narticulata, many segments; and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants,\\nmany spiral whorls of leaves. we have formerly seen that parts many times\\nrepeated are eminently liable to vary in number and structure; consequently\\nit is quite probable that natural selection, during a long-continued course\\nof modification, should have seized on a certain number of the primordially\\nsimilar elements, many times repeated, and have adapted them to the most\\ndiverse purposes. and as the whole amount of modification will have been\\neffected by slight successive steps, we need not wonder at discovering in\\nsuch parts or organs, a certain degree of fundamental resemblance, retained\\nby the strong principle of inheritance.\\n\\nin the great class of molluscs, though we can homologise the parts of one\\nspecies with those of other and distinct species, we can indicate but few\\nserial homologies; that is, we are seldom enabled to say that one {438}\\npart or organ is homologous with another in the same individual. and we can\\nunderstand this fact; for in molluscs, even in the lowest members of the\\nclass, we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of any one part,\\nas we find in the other great classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\\n\\nnaturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed\\nvertebrг¦: the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs; the stamens and pistils\\nof flowers as metamorphosed leaves; but it would in these cases probably be\\nmore correct, as professor huxley has remarked, to speak of both skull and\\nvertebrг¦, both jaws and legs, &c.,--as having been metamorphosed, not one\\nfrom the other, but from some common element. naturalists, however, use\\nsuch language only in a metaphorical sense: they are far from meaning that\\nduring a long course of descent, primordial organs of any kind--vertebrг¦ in\\nthe one case and legs in the other--have actually been modified into skulls\\nor jaws. yet so strong is the appearance of a modification of this nature\\nhaving occurred, that naturalists can hardly avoid employing language\\nhaving this plain signification. on my view these terms may be used\\nliterally; and the wonderful fact of the jaws, for instance, of a crab\\nretaining numerous characters, which they would probably have retained\\nthrough inheritance, if they had really been metamorphosed during a long\\ncourse of descent from true legs, or from some simple appendage, is\\nexplained.\\n\\n\\n\\n_embryology._--it has already been casually remarked that certain organs in\\nthe individual, which when mature become widely different and serve for\\ndifferent purposes, are in the embryo exactly alike. the embryos, also, of\\ndistinct animals within the same class are often strikingly similar: a\\nbetter proof of this cannot be given, than a {439} circumstance mentioned\\nby agassiz, namely, that having forgotten to ticket the embryo of some\\nvertebrate animal, he cannot now tell whether it be that of a mammal, bird,\\nor reptile. the vermiform larvг¦ of moths, flies, beetles, &c., resemble\\neach other much more closely than do the mature insects; but in the case of\\nlarvг¦, the embryos are active, and have been adapted for special lines of\\nlife. a trace of the law of embryonic resemblance, sometimes lasts till a\\nrather late age: thus birds of the same genus, and of closely allied\\ngenera, often resemble each other in their first and second plumage; as we\\nsee in the spotted feathers in the thrush group. in the cat tribe, most of\\nthe species are striped or spotted in lines; and stripes can be plainly\\ndistinguished in the whelp of the lion. we occasionally though rarely see\\nsomething of this kind in plants: thus the embryonic leaves of the ulex or\\nfurze, and the first leaves of the phyllodineous acaceas, are pinnate or\\ndivided like the ordinary leaves of the leguminosг¦.\\n\\nthe points of structure, in which the embryos of widely different animals\\nof the same class resemble each other, often have no direct relation to\\ntheir conditions of existence. we cannot, for instance, suppose that in the\\nembryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop-like course of the arteries\\nnear the branchial slits are related to similar conditions,--in the young\\nmammal which is nourished in the womb of its mother, in the egg of the bird\\nwhich is hatched in a nest, and in the spawn of a frog under water. we have\\nno more reason to believe in such a relation, than we have to believe that\\nthe same bones in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, and fin of a porpoise,\\nare related to similar conditions of life. no one will suppose that the\\nstripes on the whelp of a lion, or the spots on the young blackbird, {440}\\nare of any use to these animals, or are related to the conditions to which\\nthey are exposed.\\n\\nthe case, however, is different when an animal during any part of its\\nembryonic career is active, and has to provide for itself. the period of\\nactivity may come on earlier or later in life; but whenever it comes on,\\nthe adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as perfect\\nand as beautiful as in the adult animal. from such special adaptations, the\\nsimilarity of the larvг¦ or active embryos of allied animals is sometimes\\nmuch obscured; and cases could be given of the larvг¦ of two species, or of\\ntwo groups of species, differing quite as much, or even more, from each\\nother than do their adult parents. in most cases, however, the larvг¦,\\nthough active, still obey, more or less closely, the law of common\\nembryonic resemblance. cirripedes afford a good instance of this: even the\\nillustrious cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was, as it certainly\\nis, a crustacean; but a glance at the larva shows this to be the case in an\\nunmistakeable manner. so again the two main divisions of cirripedes, the\\npedunculated and sessile, which differ widely in external appearance, have\\nlarvг¦ in all their stages barely distinguishable.\\n\\nthe embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation: i\\nuse this expression, though i am aware that it is hardly possible to define\\nclearly what is meant by the organisation being higher or lower. but no one\\nprobably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than the caterpillar. in\\nsome cases, however, the mature animal is generally considered as lower in\\nthe scale than the larva, as with certain parasitic crustaceans. to refer\\nonce again to cirripedes: the larvг¦ in the first stage have three pairs of\\nlegs, a very simple single eye, and a probosciformed mouth, with which they\\nfeed largely, for they increase much in {441} size. in the second stage,\\nanswering to the chrysalis stage of butterflies, they have six pairs of\\nbeautifully constructed natatory legs, a pair of magnificent compound eyes,\\nand extremely complex antennг¦; but they have a closed and imperfect mouth,\\nand cannot feed: their function at this stage is, to search by their\\nwell-developed organs of sense, and to reach by their active powers of\\nswimming, a proper place on which to become attached and to undergo their\\nfinal metamorphosis. when this is completed they are fixed for life: their\\nlegs are now converted into prehensile organs; they again obtain a\\nwell-constructed mouth; but they have no antennг¦, and their two eyes are\\nnow reconverted into a minute, single, and very simple eye-spot. in this\\nlast and complete state, cirripedes may be considered as either more highly\\nor more lowly organised than they were in the larval condition. but in some\\ngenera the larvг¦ become developed either into hermaphrodites having the\\nordinary structure, or into what i have called complemental males: and in\\nthe latter, the development has assuredly been retrograde; for the male is\\na mere sack, which lives for a short time, and is destitute of mouth,\\nstomach, or other organ of importance, excepting for reproduction.\\n\\nwe are so much accustomed to see differences in structure between the\\nembryo and the adult, and likewise a close similarity in the embryos of\\nwidely different animals within the same class, that we might be led to\\nlook at these facts as necessarily contingent in some manner on growth. but\\nthere is no obvious reason why, for instance, the wing of a bat, or the fin\\nof a porpoise, should not have been sketched out with all the parts in\\nproper proportion, as soon as any structure became visible in the embryo.\\nand in some whole groups of animals and in certain members of other groups,\\nthe embryo does not at any period differ widely from the {442} adult: thus\\nowen has remarked in regard to cuttle-fish, \"there is no metamorphosis; the\\ncephalopodic character is manifested long before the parts of the embryo\\nare completed;\" and again in spiders, \"there is nothing worthy to be called\\na metamorphosis.\" the larvг¦ of insects, whether adapted to the most diverse\\nand active habits, or quite inactive, being fed by their parents or placed\\nin the midst of proper nutriment, yet nearly all pass through a similar\\nworm-like stage of development; but in some few cases, as in that of aphis,\\nif we look to the admirable drawings by professor huxley of the development\\nof this insect, we see no trace of the vermiform stage.\\n\\nhow, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology,--namely the\\nvery general, but not universal difference in structure between the embryo\\nand the adult;--of parts in the same individual embryo, which ultimately\\nbecome very unlike and serve for diverse purposes, being at this early\\nperiod of growth alike;--of embryos of different species within the same\\nclass, generally, but not universally, resembling each other;--of the\\nstructure of the embryo not being closely related to its conditions of\\nexistence, except when the embryo becomes at any period of life active and\\nhas to provide for itself;--of the embryo apparently having sometimes a\\nhigher organisation than the mature animal, into which it is developed? i\\nbelieve that all these facts can be explained, as follows, on the view of\\ndescent with modification.\\n\\nit is commonly assumed, perhaps from monstrosities often affecting the\\nembryos at a very early period, that slight variations necessarily appear\\nat an equally early period. but we have little evidence on this\\nhead--indeed the evidence rather points the other way; for it is notorious\\nthat breeders of cattle, horses, and various {443} fancy animals, cannot\\npositively tell, until some time after the animal has been born, what its\\nmerits or form will ultimately turn out. we see this plainly in our own\\nchildren; we cannot always tell whether the child will be tall or short, or\\nwhat its precise features will be. the question is not, at what period of\\nlife any variation has been caused, but at what period it is fully\\ndisplayed. the cause may have acted, and i believe generally has acted,\\neven before the embryo is formed; and the variation may be due to the male\\nand female sexual elements having been affected by the conditions to which\\neither parent, or their ancestors, have been exposed. nevertheless an\\neffect thus caused at a very early period, even before the formation of the\\nembryo, may appear late in life; as when an hereditary disease, which\\nappears in old age alone, has been communicated to the offspring from the\\nreproductive element of one parent. or again, as when the horns of\\ncross-bred cattle have been affected by the shape of the horns of either\\nparent. for the welfare of a very young animal, as long as it remains in\\nits mother\\'s womb, or in the egg, or as long as it is nourished and\\nprotected by its parent, it must be quite unimportant whether most of its\\ncharacters are fully acquired a little earlier or later in life. it would\\nnot signify, for instance, to a bird which obtained its food best by having\\na long beak, whether or not it assumed a beak of this particular length, as\\nlong as it was fed by its parents. hence, i conclude, that it is quite\\npossible, that each of the many successive modifications, by which each\\nspecies has acquired its present structure, may have supervened at a not\\nvery early period of life; and some direct evidence from our domestic\\nanimals supports this view. but in other cases it is quite possible that\\neach successive modification, or {444} most of them, may have appeared at\\nan extremely early period.\\n\\ni have stated in the first chapter, that there is some evidence to render\\nit probable, that at whatever age any variation first appears in the\\nparent, it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring.\\ncertain variations can only appear at corresponding ages, for instance,\\npeculiarities in the caterpillar, cocoon, or imago states of the silk-moth;\\nor, again, in the horns of almost full-grown cattle. but further than this,\\nvariations which, for all that we can see, might have appeared earlier or\\nlater in life, tend to appear at a corresponding age in the offspring and\\nparent. i am far from meaning that this is invariably the case; and i could\\ngive a good many cases of variations (taking the word in the largest sense)\\nwhich have supervened at an earlier age in the child than in the parent.\\n\\nthese two principles, if their truth be admitted, will, i believe, explain\\nall the above specified leading facts in embryology. but first let us look\\nat a few analogous cases in domestic varieties. some authors who have\\nwritten on dogs, maintain that the greyhound and bulldog, though appearing\\nso different, are really varieties most closely allied, and have probably\\ndescended from the same wild stock; hence i was curious to see how far\\ntheir puppies differed from each other: i was told by breeders that they\\ndiffered just as much as their parents, and this, judging by the eye,\\nseemed almost to be the case; but on actually measuring the old dogs and\\ntheir six-days old puppies, i found that the puppies had not nearly\\nacquired their full amount of proportional difference. so, again, i was\\ntold that the foals of cart and race-horses differed as much as the\\nfull-grown animals; and this surprised me greatly, as i think it probable\\nthat the difference between these two breeds has been wholly {445} caused\\nby selection under domestication; but having had careful measurements made\\nof the dam and of a three-days old colt of a race and heavy cart-horse, i\\nfind that the colts have by no means acquired their full amount of\\nproportional difference.\\n\\nas the evidence appears to me conclusive, that the several domestic breeds\\nof pigeon have descended from one wild species, i compared young pigeons of\\nvarious breeds, within twelve hours after being hatched; i carefully\\nmeasured the proportions (but will not here give details) of the beak,\\nwidth of mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length of\\nleg, in the wild stock, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs, dragons,\\ncarriers, and tumblers. now some of these birds, when mature, differ so\\nextraordinarily in length and form of beak, that they would, i cannot\\ndoubt, be ranked in distinct genera, had they been natural productions. but\\nwhen the nestling birds of these several breeds were placed in a row,\\nthough most of them could be distinguished from each other, yet their\\nproportional differences in the above specified several points were\\nincomparably less than in the full-grown birds. some characteristic points\\nof difference--for instance, that of the width of mouth--could hardly be\\ndetected in the young. but there was one remarkable exception to this rule,\\nfor the young of the short-faced tumbler differed from the young of the\\nwild rock-pigeon and of the other breeds, in all its proportions, almost\\nexactly as much as in the adult state.\\n\\nthe two principles above given seem to me to explain these facts in regard\\nto the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties. fanciers select\\ntheir horses, dogs, and pigeons, for breeding, when they are nearly grown\\nup: they are indifferent whether the desired qualities and structures have\\nbeen acquired earlier or {446} later in life, if the full-grown animal\\npossesses them. and the cases just given, more especially that of pigeons,\\nseem to show that the characteristic differences which give value to each\\nbreed, and which have been accumulated by man\\'s selection, have not\\ngenerally first appeared at an early period of life, and have been\\ninherited by the offspring at a corresponding not early period. but the\\ncase of the short-faced tumbler, which when twelve hours old had acquired\\nits proper proportions, proves that this is not the universal rule; for\\nhere the characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier\\nperiod than usual, or, if not so, the differences must have been inherited,\\nnot at the corresponding, but at an earlier age.\\n\\nnow let us apply these facts and the above two principles--which latter,\\nthough not proved true, can be shown to be in some degree probable--to\\nspecies in a state of nature. let us take a genus of birds, descended on my\\ntheory from some one parent-species, and of which the several new species\\nhave become modified through natural selection in accordance with their\\ndiverse habits. then, from the many slight successive steps of variation\\nhaving supervened at a rather late age, and having been inherited at a\\ncorresponding age, the young of the new species of our supposed genus will\\nmanifestly tend to resemble each other much more closely than do the\\nadults, just as we have seen in the case of pigeons. we may extend this\\nview to whole families or even classes. the fore-limbs, for instance, which\\nserved as legs in the parent-species, may have become, by a long course of\\nmodification, adapted in one descendant to act as hands, in another as\\npaddles, in another as wings; and on the above two principles--namely of\\neach successive modification supervening at a rather late age, and being\\ninherited at a {447} corresponding late age--the fore-limbs in the embryos\\nof the several descendants of the parent-species will still resemble each\\nother closely, for they will not have been modified. but in each of our new\\nspecies, the embryonic fore-limbs will differ greatly from the fore-limbs\\nin the mature animal; the limbs in the latter having undergone much\\nmodification at a rather late period of life, and having thus been\\nconverted into hands, or paddles, or wings. whatever influence\\nlong-continued exercise or use on the one hand, and disuse on the other,\\nmay have in modifying an organ, such influence will mainly affect the\\nmature animal, which has come to its full powers of activity and has to\\ngain its own living; and the effects thus produced will be inherited at a\\ncorresponding mature age. whereas the young will remain unmodified, or be\\nmodified in a lesser degree, by the effects of use and disuse.\\n\\nin certain cases the successive steps of variation might supervene, from\\ncauses of which we are wholly ignorant, at a very early period of life, or\\neach step might be inherited at an earlier period than that at which it\\nfirst appeared. in either case (as with the short-faced tumbler) the young\\nor embryo would closely resemble the mature parent-form. we have seen that\\nthis is the rule of development in certain whole groups of animals, as with\\ncuttle-fish and spiders, and with a few members of the great class of\\ninsects, as with aphis. with respect to the final cause of the young in\\nthese cases not undergoing any metamorphosis, or closely resembling their\\nparents from their earliest age, we can see that this would result from the\\ntwo following contingencies: firstly, from the young, during a course of\\nmodification carried on for many generations, having to provide for their\\nown wants at a very early stage {448} of development, and secondly, from\\ntheir following exactly the same habits of life with their parents; for in\\nthis case, it would be indispensable for the existence of the species, that\\nthe child should be modified at a very early age in the same manner with\\nits parents, in accordance with their similar habits. some further\\nexplanation, however, of the embryo not undergoing any metamorphosis is\\nperhaps requisite. if, on the other hand, it profited the young to follow\\nhabits of life in any degree different from those of their parent, and\\nconsequently to be constructed in a slightly different manner, then, on the\\nprinciple of inheritance at corresponding ages, the active young or larvг¦\\nmight easily be rendered by natural selection different to any conceivable\\nextent from their parents. such differences might, also, become correlated\\nwith successive stages of development; so that the larvг¦, in the first\\nstage, might differ greatly from the larvг¦ in the second stage, as we have\\nseen to be the case with cirripedes. the adult might become fitted for\\nsites or habits, in which organs of locomotion or of the senses, &c., would\\nbe useless; and in this case the final metamorphosis would be said to be\\nretrograde.\\n\\nas all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived on\\nthis earth have to be classed together, and as all have been connected by\\nthe finest gradations, the best, or indeed, if our collections were nearly\\nperfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical. descent\\nbeing on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been\\nseeking under the term of the natural system. on this view we can\\nunderstand how it is that, in the eyes of most naturalists, the structure\\nof the embryo is even more important for classification than that of the\\nadult. for the embryo is the animal in its less modified state; {449} and\\nin so far it reveals the structure of its progenitor. in two groups of\\nanimals, however much they may at present differ from each other in\\nstructure and habits, if they pass through the same or similar embryonic\\nstages, we may feel assured that they have both descended from the same or\\nnearly similar parents, and are therefore in that degree closely related.\\nthus, community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent. it\\nwill reveal this community of descent, however much the structure of the\\nadult may have been modified and obscured; we have seen, for instance, that\\ncirripedes can at once be recognised by their larvг¦ as belonging to the\\ngreat class of crustaceans. as the embryonic state of each species and\\ngroup of species partially shows us the structure of their less modified\\nancient progenitors, we can clearly see why ancient and extinct forms of\\nlife should resemble the embryos of their descendants,--our existing\\nspecies. agassiz believes this to be a law of nature; but i am bound to\\nconfess that i only hope to see the law hereafter proved true. it can be\\nproved true in those cases alone in which the ancient state, now supposed\\nto be represented in existing embryos, has not been obliterated, either by\\nthe successive variations in a long course of modification having\\nsupervened at a very early age, or by the variations having been inherited\\nat an earlier period than that at which they first appeared. it should also\\nbe borne in mind, that the supposed law of resemblance of ancient forms of\\nlife to the embryonic stages of recent forms, may be true, but yet, owing\\nto the geological record not extending far enough back in time, may remain\\nfor a long period, or for ever, incapable of demonstration.\\n\\nthus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which are second\\nin importance to none in natural history, are explained on the principle of\\nslight {450} modifications not appearing, in the many descendants from some\\none ancient progenitor, at a very early period in the life of each, though\\nperhaps caused at the earliest, and being inherited at a corresponding not\\nearly period. embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus look at\\nthe embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the common parent-form\\nof each great class of animals.\\n\\n\\n\\n_rudimentary, atrophied, or aborted organs._--organs or parts in this\\nstrange condition, bearing the stamp of inutility, are extremely common\\nthroughout nature. for instance, rudimentary mammг¦ are very general in the\\nmales of mammals: i presume that the \"bastard-wing\" in birds may be safely\\nconsidered as a digit in a rudimentary state: in very many snakes one lobe\\nof the lungs is rudimentary; in other snakes there are rudiments of the\\npelvis and hind limbs. some of the cases of rudimentary organs are\\nextremely curious; for instance, the presence of teeth in foetal whales,\\nwhich when grown up have not a tooth in their heads; and the presence of\\nteeth, which never cut through the gums, in the upper jaws of our unborn\\ncalves. it has even been stated on good authority that rudiments of teeth\\ncan be detected in the beaks of certain embryonic birds. nothing can be\\nplainer than that wings are formed for flight, yet in how many insects do\\nwe see wings so reduced in size as to be utterly incapable of flight, and\\nnot rarely lying under wing-cases, firmly soldered together!\\n\\nthe meaning of rudimentary organs is often quite unmistakeable: for\\ninstance there are beetles of the same genus (and even of the same species)\\nresembling each other most closely in all respects, one of which will have\\nfull-sized wings, and another mere rudiments of membrane; and here it is\\nimpossible to doubt, that the {451} rudiments represent wings. rudimentary\\norgans sometimes retain their potentiality, and are merely not developed:\\nthis seems to be the case with the mammг¦ of male mammals, for many\\ninstances are on record of these organs having become well developed in\\nfull-grown males, and having secreted milk. so again there are normally\\nfour developed and two rudimentary teats in the udders of the genus bos,\\nbut in our domestic cows the two sometimes become developed and give milk.\\nin plants of the same species the petals sometimes occur as mere rudiments,\\nand sometimes in a well-developed state. in plants with separated sexes,\\nthe male flowers often have a rudiment of a pistil; and kг¶lreuter found\\nthat by crossing such male plants with an hermaphrodite species, the\\nrudiment of the pistil in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size;\\nand this shows that the rudiment and the perfect pistil are essentially\\nalike in nature.\\n\\nan organ serving for two purposes, may become rudimentary or utterly\\naborted for one, even the more important purpose; and remain perfectly\\nefficient for the other. thus in plants, the office of the pistil is to\\nallow the pollen-tubes to reach the ovules protected in the ovarium at its\\nbase. the pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style; but in some\\ncompositг¦, the male florets, which of course cannot be fecundated, have a\\npistil, which is in a rudimentary state, for it is not crowned with a\\nstigma; but the style remains well developed, and is clothed with hairs as\\nin other compositг¦, for the purpose of brushing the pollen out of the\\nsurrounding anthers. again, an organ may become rudimentary for its proper\\npurpose, and be used for a distinct object: in certain fish the\\nswim-bladder seems to be nearly rudimentary for its proper function of\\ngiving buoyancy, but has become converted into a {452} nascent breathing\\norgan or lung. other similar instances could be given.\\n\\norgans, however little developed, if of use, should not be called\\nrudimentary; they cannot properly be said to be in an atrophied condition;\\nthey may be called nascent, and may hereafter be developed to any extent by\\nnatural selection. rudimentary organs, on the other hand, are essentially\\nuseless, as teeth which never cut through the gums; in a still less\\ndeveloped condition, they would be of still less use. they cannot,\\ntherefore, under their present condition, have been formed by natural\\nselection, which acts solely by the preservation of useful modifications;\\nthey have been retained, as we shall see, by inheritance, and relate to a\\nformer condition of their possessor. it is difficult to know what are\\nnascent organs; looking to the future, we cannot of course tell how any\\npart will be developed, and whether it is now nascent; looking to the past,\\ncreatures with an organ in a nascent condition will generally have been\\nsupplanted and exterminated by their successors with the organ in a more\\nperfect and developed condition. the wing of the penguin is of high\\nservice, and acts as a fin; it may, therefore, represent the nascent state\\nof the wings of birds; not that i believe this to be the case, it is more\\nprobably a reduced organ, modified for a new function: the wing of the\\napteryx is useless, and is truly rudimentary. the mammary glands of the\\nornithorhynchus may, perhaps, be considered, in comparison with the udder\\nof a cow, as in a nascent state. the ovigerous frena of certain cirripedes,\\nwhich are only slightly developed and which have ceased to give attachment\\nto the ova, are nascent branchiг¦.\\n\\nrudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very liable\\nto vary in degree of development {453} and in other respects. moreover, in\\nclosely allied species, the degree to which the same organ has been\\nrendered rudimentary occasionally differs much. this latter fact is well\\nexemplified in the state of the wings of the female moths in certain\\ngroups. rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted; and this implies, that\\nwe find in an animal or plant no trace of an organ, which analogy would\\nlead us to expect to find, and which is occasionally found in monstrous\\nindividuals of the species. thus in the snapdragon (antirrhinum) we\\ngenerally do not find a rudiment of a fifth stamen; but this may sometimes\\nbe seen. in tracing the homologies of the same part in different members of\\na class, nothing is more common, or more necessary, than the use and\\ndiscovery of rudiments. this is well shown in the drawings given by owen of\\nthe bones of the leg of the horse, ox, and rhinoceros.\\n\\nit is an important fact that rudimentary organs, such as teeth in the upper\\njaws of whales and ruminants, can often be detected in the embryo, but\\nafterwards wholly disappear. it is also, i believe, a universal rule, that\\na rudimentary part or organ is of greater size relatively to the adjoining\\nparts in the embryo, than in the adult; so that the organ at this early age\\nis less rudimentary, or even cannot be said to be in any degree\\nrudimentary. hence, also, a rudimentary organ in the adult is often said to\\nhave retained its embryonic condition.\\n\\ni have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs. in\\nreflecting on them, every one must be struck with astonishment: for the\\nsame reasoning power which tells us plainly that most parts and organs are\\nexquisitely adapted for certain purposes, tells us with equal plainness\\nthat these rudimentary or atrophied organs, are imperfect and useless. in\\nworks {454} on natural history rudimentary organs are generally said to\\nhave been created \"for the sake of symmetry,\" or in order \"to complete the\\nscheme of nature;\" but this seems to me no explanation, merely a\\nre-statement of the fact. would it be thought sufficient to say that\\nbecause planets revolve in elliptic courses round the sun, satellites\\nfollow the same course round the planets, for the sake of symmetry, and to\\ncomplete the scheme of nature? an eminent physiologist accounts for the\\npresence of rudimentary organs, by supposing that they serve to excrete\\nmatter in excess, or injurious to the system; but can we suppose that the\\nminute papilla, which often represents the pistil in male flowers, and\\nwhich is formed merely of cellular tissue, can thus act? can we suppose\\nthat the formation of rudimentary teeth, which are subsequently absorbed,\\ncan be of any service to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by the\\nexcretion of precious phosphate of lime? when a man\\'s fingers have been\\namputated, imperfect nails sometimes appear on the stumps: i could as soon\\nbelieve that these vestiges of nails have appeared, not from unknown laws\\nof growth, but in order to excrete horny matter, as that the rudimentary\\nnails on the fin of the manatee were formed for this purpose.\\n\\non my view of descent with modification, the origin of rudimentary organs\\nis simple. we have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our domestic\\nproductions,--as the stump of a tail in tailless breeds,--the vestige of an\\near in earless breeds,--the reappearance of minute dangling horns in\\nhornless breeds of cattle, more especially, according to youatt, in young\\nanimals,--and the state of the whole flower in the cauliflower. we often\\nsee rudiments of various parts in monsters. but i doubt whether any of\\nthese cases throw light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of\\nnature, {455} further than by showing that rudiments can be produced; for i\\ndoubt whether species under nature ever undergo abrupt changes. i believe\\nthat disuse has been the main agency; that it has led in successive\\ngenerations to the gradual reduction of various organs, until they have\\nbecome rudimentary,--as in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark\\ncaverns, and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands, which have\\nseldom been forced to take flight, and have ultimately lost the power of\\nflying. again, an organ useful under certain conditions, might become\\ninjurious under others, as with the wings of beetles living on small and\\nexposed islands; and in this case natural selection would continue slowly\\nto reduce the organ, until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary.\\n\\nany change in function, which can be effected by insensibly small steps, is\\nwithin the power of natural selection; so that an organ rendered, during\\nchanged habits of life, useless or injurious for one purpose, might be\\nmodified and used for another purpose. or an organ might be retained for\\none alone of its former functions. an organ, when rendered useless, may\\nwell be variable, for its variations cannot be checked by natural\\nselection. at whatever period of life disuse or selection reduces an organ,\\nand this will generally be when the being has come to maturity and to its\\nfull powers of action, the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages\\nwill reproduce the organ in its reduced state at the same age, and\\nconsequently will seldom affect or reduce it in the embryo. thus we can\\nunderstand the greater relative size of rudimentary organs in the embryo,\\nand their lesser relative size in the adult. but if each step of the\\nprocess of reduction were to be inherited, not at the corresponding age,\\nbut at an extremely early period of life (as we have good {456} reason to\\nbelieve to be possible), the rudimentary part would tend to be wholly lost,\\nand we should have a case of complete abortion. the principle, also, of\\neconomy, explained in a former chapter, by which the materials forming any\\npart or structure, if not useful to the possessor, will be saved as far as\\nis possible, will probably often come into play; and this will tend to\\ncause the entire obliteration of a rudimentary organ.\\n\\nas the presence of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendency in every\\npart of the organisation, which has long existed, to be inherited--we can\\nunderstand, on the genealogical view of classification, how it is that\\nsystematists have found rudimentary parts as useful as, or even sometimes\\nmore useful than, parts of high physiological importance. rudimentary\\norgans may be compared with the letters in a word, still retained in the\\nspelling, but become useless in the pronunciation, but which serve as a\\nclue in seeking for its derivation. on the view of descent with\\nmodification, we may conclude that the existence of organs in a\\nrudimentary, imperfect, and useless condition, or quite aborted, far from\\npresenting a strange difficulty, as they assuredly do on the ordinary\\ndoctrine of creation, might even have been anticipated, and can be\\naccounted for by the laws of inheritance.\\n\\n\\n\\n_summary._--in this chapter i have attempted to show, that the\\nsubordination of group to group in all organisms throughout all time; that\\nthe nature of the relationship, by which all living and extinct beings are\\nunited by complex, radiating, and circuitous lines of affinities into one\\ngrand system; the rules followed and the difficulties encountered by\\nnaturalists in their classifications; the value set upon characters, if\\nconstant and prevalent, whether of high vital importance, or of the most\\ntrifling {457} importance, or, as in rudimentary organs, of no importance;\\nthe wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive characters, and\\ncharacters of true affinity; and other such rules;--all naturally follow on\\nthe view of the common parentage of those forms which are considered by\\nnaturalists as allied, together with their modification through natural\\nselection, with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of\\ncharacter. in considering this view of classification, it should be borne\\nin mind that the element of descent has been universally used in ranking\\ntogether the sexes, ages, and acknowledged varieties of the same species,\\nhowever different they may be in structure. if we extend the use of this\\nelement of descent,--the only certainly known cause of similarity in\\norganic beings,--we shall understand what is meant by the natural system:\\nit is genealogical in its attempted arrangement, with the grades of\\nacquired difference marked by the terms varieties, species, genera,\\nfamilies, orders, and classes.\\n\\non this same view of descent with modification, all the great facts in\\nmorphology become intelligible,--whether we look to the same pattern\\ndisplayed in the homologous organs, to whatever purpose applied, of the\\ndifferent species of a class; or to the homologous parts constructed on the\\nsame pattern in each individual animal and plant.\\n\\non the principle of successive slight variations, not necessarily or\\ngenerally supervening at a very early period of life, and being inherited\\nat a corresponding period, we can understand the great leading facts in\\nembryology; namely, the resemblance in an individual embryo of the\\nhomologous parts, which when matured will become widely different from each\\nother in structure and function; and the resemblance in different species\\nof a class of the homologous parts or {458} organs, though fitted in the\\nadult members for purposes as different as possible. larvг¦ are active\\nembryos, which have become specially modified in relation to their habits\\nof life, through the principle of modifications being inherited at\\ncorresponding ages. on this same principle--and bearing in mind, that when\\norgans are reduced in size, either from disuse or selection, it will\\ngenerally be at that period of life when the being has to provide for its\\nown wants, and bearing in mind how strong is the principle of\\ninheritance--the occurrence of rudimentary organs and their final abortion,\\npresent to us no inexplicable difficulties; on the contrary, their presence\\nmight have been even anticipated. the importance of embryological\\ncharacters and of rudimentary organs in classification is intelligible, on\\nthe view that an arrangement is only so far natural as it is genealogical.\\n\\nfinally, the several classes of facts which have been considered in this\\nchapter, seem to me to proclaim so plainly, that the innumerable species,\\ngenera, and families of organic beings, with which this world is peopled,\\nhave all descended, each within its own class or group, from common\\nparents, and have all been modified in the course of descent, that i should\\nwithout hesitation adopt this view, even if it were unsupported by other\\nfacts or arguments.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *       *\\n\\n\\n{459}\\n\\nchapter xiv.\\n\\nrecapitulation and conclusion.\\n\\n    recapitulation of the difficulties on the theory of natural\\n    selection--recapitulation of the general and special circumstances in\\n    its favour--causes of the general belief in the immutability of\\n    species--how far the theory of natural selection may be\\n    extended--effects of its adoption on the study of natural\\n    history--concluding remarks.\\n\\nas this whole volume is one long argument, it may be convenient to the\\nreader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated.\\n\\nthat many and serious objections may be advanced against the theory of\\ndescent with modification through natural selection, i do not deny. i have\\nendeavoured to give to them their full force. nothing at first can appear\\nmore difficult to believe than that the more complex organs and instincts\\nshould have been perfected, not by means superior to, though analogous\\nwith, human reason, but by the accumulation of innumerable slight\\nvariations, each good for the individual possessor. nevertheless, this\\ndifficulty, though appearing to our imagination insuperably great, cannot\\nbe considered real if we admit the following propositions, namely,--that\\ngradations in the perfection of any organ or instinct which we may\\nconsider, either do now exist or could have existed, each good of its\\nkind,--that all organs and instincts are, in ever so slight a degree,\\nvariable,--and, lastly, that there is a struggle for existence leading to\\nthe preservation of each profitable deviation of structure or instinct. the\\ntruth of these propositions cannot, i think, be disputed. {460}\\n\\nit is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conjecture by what gradations\\nmany structures have been perfected, more especially amongst broken and\\nfailing groups of organic beings; but we see so many strange gradations in\\nnature, that we ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or\\ninstinct, or any whole being, could not have arrived at its present state\\nby many graduated steps. there are, it must be admitted, cases of special\\ndifficulty on the theory of natural selection; and one of the most curious\\nof these is the existence of two or three defined castes of workers or\\nsterile females in the same community of ants; but i have attempted to show\\nhow this difficulty can be mastered.\\n\\nwith respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first\\ncrossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal\\nfertility of varieties when crossed, i must refer the reader to the\\nrecapitulation of the facts given at the end of the eighth chapter, which\\nseem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special\\nendowment than is the incapacity of two trees to be grafted together; but\\nthat it is incidental on constitutional differences in the reproductive\\nsystems of the intercrossed species. we see the truth of this conclusion in\\nthe vast difference in the result, when the same two species are crossed\\nreciprocally; that is, when one species is first used as the father and\\nthen as the mother.\\n\\nthe fertility of varieties when intercrossed and of their mongrel offspring\\ncannot be considered as universal; nor is their very general fertility\\nsurprising when we remember that it is not likely that either their\\nconstitutions or their reproductive systems should have been profoundly\\nmodified. moreover, most of the varieties which have been experimentised on\\nhave been {461} produced under domestication; and as domestication (i do\\nnot mean mere confinement) apparently tends to eliminate sterility, we\\nought not to expect it also to produce sterility.\\n\\nthe sterility of hybrids is a very different case from that of first\\ncrosses, for their reproductive organs are more or less functionally\\nimpotent; whereas in first crosses the organs on both sides are in a\\nperfect condition. as we continually see that organisms of all kinds are\\nrendered in some degree sterile from their constitutions having been\\ndisturbed by slightly different and new conditions of life, we need not\\nfeel surprise at hybrids being in some degree sterile, for their\\nconstitutions can hardly fail to have been disturbed from being compounded\\nof two distinct organisations. this parallelism is supported by another\\nparallel, but directly opposite, class of facts; namely, that the vigour\\nand fertility of all organic beings are increased by slight changes in\\ntheir conditions of life, and that the offspring of slightly modified forms\\nor varieties acquire from being crossed increased vigour and fertility. so\\nthat, on the one hand, considerable changes in the conditions of life and\\ncrosses between greatly modified forms, lessen fertility; and on the other\\nhand, lesser changes in the conditions of life and crosses between less\\nmodified forms, increase fertility.\\n\\nturning to geographical distribution, the difficulties encountered on the\\ntheory of descent with modification are grave enough. all the individuals\\nof the same species, and all the species of the same genus, or even higher\\ngroup, must have descended from common parents; and therefore, in however\\ndistant and isolated parts of the world they are now found, they must in\\nthe course of successive generations have passed from some one part to the\\nothers. we are often wholly unable {462} even to conjecture how this could\\nhave been effected. yet, as we have reason to believe that some species\\nhave retained the same specific form for very long periods, enormously long\\nas measured by years, too much stress ought not to be laid on the\\noccasional wide diffusion of the same species; for during very long periods\\nof time there will always have been a good chance for wide migration by\\nmany means. a broken or interrupted range may often be accounted for by the\\nextinction of the species in the intermediate regions. it cannot be denied\\nthat we are as yet very ignorant of the full extent of the various climatal\\nand geographical changes which have affected the earth during modern\\nperiods; and such changes will obviously have greatly facilitated\\nmigration. as an example, i have attempted to show how potent has been the\\ninfluence of the glacial period on the distribution both of the same and of\\nrepresentative species throughout the world. we are as yet profoundly\\nignorant of the many occasional means of transport. with respect to\\ndistinct species of the same genus inhabiting very distant and isolated\\nregions, as the process of modification has necessarily been slow, all the\\nmeans of migration will have been possible during a very long period; and\\nconsequently the difficulty of the wide diffusion of species of the same\\ngenus is in some degree lessened.\\n\\nas on the theory of natural selection an interminable number of\\nintermediate forms must have existed, linking together all the species in\\neach group by gradations as fine as our present varieties, it may be asked,\\nwhy do we not see these linking forms all around us? why are not all\\norganic beings blended together in an inextricable chaos? with respect to\\nexisting forms, we should remember that we have no right to expect\\n(excepting in rare cases) to discover _directly_ connecting {463} links\\nbetween them, but only between each and some extinct and supplanted form.\\neven on a wide area, which has during a long period remained continuous,\\nand of which the climate and other conditions of life change insensibly in\\ngoing from a district occupied by one species into another district\\noccupied by a closely allied species, we have no just right to expect often\\nto find intermediate varieties in the intermediate zone. for we have reason\\nto believe that only a few species are undergoing change at any one period;\\nand all changes are slowly effected. i have also shown that the\\nintermediate varieties which will at first probably exist in the\\nintermediate zones, will be liable to be supplanted by the allied forms on\\neither hand; and the latter, from existing in greater numbers, will\\ngenerally be modified and improved at a quicker rate than the intermediate\\nvarieties, which exist in lesser numbers; so that the intermediate\\nvarieties will, in the long run, be supplanted and exterminated.\\n\\non this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting links,\\nbetween the living and extinct inhabitants of the world, and at each\\nsuccessive period between the extinct and still older species, why is not\\nevery geological formation charged with such links? why does not every\\ncollection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and\\nmutation of the forms of life? we meet with no such evidence, and this is\\nthe most obvious and forcible of the many objections which may be urged\\nagainst my theory. why, again, do whole groups of allied species appear,\\nthough certainly they often falsely appear, to have come in suddenly on the\\nseveral geological stages? why do we not find great piles of strata beneath\\nthe silurian system, stored with the remains of the progenitors of the\\nsilurian groups of fossils? for certainly on my theory such {464} strata\\nmust somewhere have been deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown\\nepochs in the world\\'s history.\\n\\ni can answer these questions and grave objections only on the supposition\\nthat the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists\\nbelieve. it cannot be objected that there has not been time sufficient for\\nany amount of organic change; for the lapse of time has been so great as to\\nbe utterly inappreciable by the human intellect. the number of specimens in\\nall our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with the countless\\ngenerations of countless species which certainly have existed. we should\\nnot be able to recognise a species as the parent of any one or more species\\nif we were to examine them ever so closely, unless we likewise possessed\\nmany of the intermediate links between their past or parent and present\\nstates; and these many links we could hardly ever expect to discover, owing\\nto the imperfection of the geological record. numerous existing doubtful\\nforms could be named which are probably varieties; but who will pretend\\nthat in future ages so many fossil links will be discovered, that\\nnaturalists will be able to decide, on the common view, whether or not\\nthese doubtful forms are varieties? as long as most of the links between\\nany two species are unknown, if any one link or intermediate variety be\\ndiscovered, it will simply be classed as another and distinct species. only\\na small portion of the world has been geologically explored. only organic\\nbeings of certain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition, at least\\nin any great number. widely ranging species vary most, and varieties are\\noften at first local,--both causes rendering the discovery of intermediate\\nlinks less likely. local varieties will not spread into other and distant\\nregions until they are considerably modified and {465} improved; and when\\nthey do spread, if discovered in a geological formation, they will appear\\nas if suddenly created there, and will be simply classed as new species.\\nmost formations have been intermittent in their accumulation; and their\\nduration, i am inclined to believe, has been shorter than the average\\nduration of specific forms. successive formations are separated from each\\nother by enormous blank intervals of time; for fossiliferous formations,\\nthick enough to resist future degradation, can be accumulated only where\\nmuch sediment is deposited on the subsiding bed of the sea. during the\\nalternate periods of elevation and of stationary level the record will be\\nblank. during these latter periods there will probably be more variability\\nin the forms of life; during periods of subsidence, more extinction.\\n\\nwith respect to the absence of fossiliferous formations beneath the lowest\\nsilurian strata, i can only recur to the hypothesis given in the ninth\\nchapter. that the geological record is imperfect all will admit; but that\\nit is imperfect to the degree which i require, few will be inclined to\\nadmit. if we look to long enough intervals of time, geology plainly\\ndeclares that all species have changed; and they have changed in the manner\\nwhich my theory requires, for they have changed slowly and in a graduated\\nmanner. we clearly see this in the fossil remains from consecutive\\nformations invariably being much more closely related to each other, than\\nare the fossils from formations distant from each other in time.\\n\\nsuch is the sum of the several chief objections and difficulties which may\\njustly be urged against my theory; and i have now briefly recapitulated the\\nanswers and explanations which can be given to them. i have felt these\\ndifficulties far too heavily during many years to {466} doubt their weight.\\nbut it deserves especial notice that the more important objections relate\\nto questions on which we are confessedly ignorant; nor do we know how\\nignorant we are. we do not know all the possible transitional gradations\\nbetween the simplest and the most perfect organs; it cannot be pretended\\nthat we know all the varied means of distribution during the long lapse of\\nyears, or that we know how imperfect the geological record is. grave as\\nthese several difficulties are, in my judgment they do not overthrow the\\ntheory of descent from a few created forms with subsequent modification.\\n\\n\\n\\nnow let us turn to the other side of the argument. under domestication we\\nsee much variability. this seems to be mainly due to the reproductive\\nsystem being eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life; so\\nthat this system, when not rendered impotent, fails to reproduce offspring\\nexactly like the parent-form. variability is governed by many complex\\nlaws,--by correlation of growth, by use and disuse, and by the direct\\naction of the physical conditions of life. there is much difficulty in\\nascertaining how much modification our domestic productions have undergone;\\nbut we may safely infer that the amount has been large, and that\\nmodifications can be inherited for long periods. as long as the conditions\\nof life remain the same, we have reason to believe that a modification,\\nwhich has already been inherited for many generations, may continue to be\\ninherited for an almost infinite number of generations. on the other hand\\nwe have evidence that variability, when it has once come into play, does\\nnot wholly cease; for new varieties are still occasionally produced by our\\nmost anciently domesticated productions. {467}\\n\\nman does not actually produce variability; he only unintentionally exposes\\norganic beings to new conditions of life, and then nature acts on the\\norganisation, and causes variability. but man can and does select the\\nvariations given to him by nature, and thus accumulate them in any desired\\nmanner. he thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or pleasure.\\nhe may do this methodically, or he may do it unconsciously by preserving\\nthe individuals most useful to him at the time, without any thought of\\naltering the breed. it is certain that he can largely influence the\\ncharacter of a breed by selecting, in each successive generation,\\nindividual differences so slight as to be quite inappreciable by an\\nuneducated eye. this process of selection has been the great agency in the\\nproduction of the most distinct and useful domestic breeds. that many of\\nthe breeds produced by man have to a large extent the character of natural\\nspecies, is shown by the inextricable doubts whether very many of them are\\nvarieties or aboriginal species.\\n\\nthere is no obvious reason why the principles which have acted so\\nefficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature. in the\\npreservation of favoured individuals and races, during the\\nconstantly-recurrent struggle for existence, we see the most powerful and\\never-acting means of selection. the struggle for existence inevitably\\nfollows from the high geometrical ratio of increase which is common to all\\norganic beings. this high rate of increase is proved by calculation,--by\\nthe rapid increase of many animals and plants during a succession of\\npeculiar seasons, or when naturalised in a new country. more individuals\\nare born than can possibly survive. a grain in the balance will determine\\nwhich individual shall live and which shall die,--which variety or species\\nshall increase in number, and which {468} shall decrease, or finally become\\nextinct. as the individuals of the same species come in all respects into\\nthe closest competition with each other, the struggle will generally be\\nmost severe between them; it will be almost equally severe between the\\nvarieties of the same species, and next in severity between the species of\\nthe same genus. but the struggle will often be very severe between beings\\nmost remote in the scale of nature. the slightest advantage in one being,\\nat any age or during any season, over those with which it comes into\\ncompetition, or better adaptation in however slight a degree to the\\nsurrounding physical conditions, will turn the balance.\\n\\nwith animals having separated sexes there will in most cases be a struggle\\nbetween the males for possession of the females. the most vigorous\\nindividuals, or those which have most successfully struggled with their\\nconditions of life, will generally leave most progeny. but success will\\noften depend on having special weapons or means of defence, or on the\\ncharms of the males; and the slightest advantage will lead to victory.\\n\\nas geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical\\nchanges, we might have expected that organic beings would have varied under\\nnature, in the same way as they generally have varied under the changed\\nconditions of domestication. and if there be any variability under nature,\\nit would be an unaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into\\nplay. it has often been asserted, but the assertion is quite incapable of\\nproof, that the amount of variation under nature is a strictly limited\\nquantity. man, though acting on external characters alone and often\\ncapriciously, can produce within a short period a great result by adding up\\nmere individual differences in his domestic productions; and every one\\nadmits that there are at least individual differences in species under\\n{469} nature. but, besides such differences, all naturalists have admitted\\nthe existence of varieties, which they think sufficiently distinct to be\\nworthy of record in systematic works. no one can draw any clear distinction\\nbetween individual differences and slight varieties; or between more\\nplainly marked varieties and sub-species, and species. let it be observed\\nhow naturalists differ in the rank which they assign to the many\\nrepresentative forms in europe and north america.\\n\\nif then we have under nature variability and a powerful agent always ready\\nto act and select, why should we doubt that variations in any way useful to\\nbeings, under their excessively complex relations of life, would be\\npreserved, accumulated, and inherited? why, if man can by patience select\\nvariations most useful to himself, should nature fail in selecting\\nvariations useful, under changing conditions of life, to her living\\nproducts? what limit can be put to this power, acting during long ages and\\nrigidly scrutinising the whole constitution, structure, and habits of each\\ncreature,--favouring the good and rejecting the bad? i can see no limit to\\nthis power, in slowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most\\ncomplex relations of life. the theory of natural selection, even if we\\nlooked no further than this, seems to me to be in itself probable. i have\\nalready recapitulated, as fairly as i could, the opposed difficulties and\\nobjections: now let us turn to the special facts and arguments in favour of\\nthe theory.\\n\\non the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties,\\nand that each species first existed as a variety, we can see why it is that\\nno line of demarcation can be drawn between species, commonly supposed to\\nhave been produced by special acts of creation, and varieties which are\\nacknowledged to have been produced by secondary laws. on this same {470}\\nview we can understand how it is that in each region where many species of\\na genus have been produced, and where they now flourish, these same species\\nshould present many varieties; for where the manufactory of species has\\nbeen active, we might expect, as a general rule, to find it still in\\naction; and this is the case if varieties be incipient species. moreover,\\nthe species of the larger genera, which afford the greater number of\\nvarieties or incipient species, retain to a certain degree the character of\\nvarieties; for they differ from each other by a less amount of difference\\nthan do the species of smaller genera. the closely allied species also of\\nthe larger genera apparently have restricted ranges, and in their\\naffinities they are clustered in little groups round other species--in\\nwhich respects they resemble varieties. these are strange relations on the\\nview of each species having been independently created, but are\\nintelligible if all species first existed as varieties.\\n\\nas each species tends by its geometrical ratio of reproduction to increase\\ninordinately in number; and as the modified descendants of each species\\nwill be enabled to increase by so much the more as they become diversified\\nin habits and structure, so as to be enabled to seize on many and widely\\ndifferent places in the economy of nature, there will be a constant\\ntendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent offspring of\\nany one species. hence during a long-continued course of modification, the\\nslight differences, characteristic of varieties of the same species, tend\\nto be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of species of\\nthe same genus. new and improved varieties will inevitably supplant and\\nexterminate the older, less improved and intermediate varieties; and thus\\nspecies are rendered to a large extent defined and distinct objects.\\ndominant species belonging to the {471} larger groups tend to give birth to\\nnew and dominant forms; so that each large group tends to become still\\nlarger, and at the same time more divergent in character. but as all groups\\ncannot thus succeed in increasing in size, for the world would not hold\\nthem, the more dominant groups beat the less dominant. this tendency in the\\nlarge groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character,\\ntogether with the almost inevitable contingency of much extinction,\\nexplains the arrangement of all the forms of life, in groups subordinate to\\ngroups, all within a few great classes, which we now see everywhere around\\nus, and which has prevailed throughout all time. this grand fact of the\\ngrouping of all organic beings seems to me utterly inexplicable on the\\ntheory of creation.\\n\\nas natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight, successive,\\nfavourable variations, it can produce no great or sudden modification; it\\ncan act only by very short and slow steps. hence the canon of \"natura non\\nfacit saltum,\" which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to make\\ntruer, is on this theory simply intelligible. we can plainly see why nature\\nis prodigal in variety, though niggard in innovation. but why this should\\nbe a law of nature if each species has been independently created, no man\\ncan explain.\\n\\nmany other facts are, as it seems to me, explicable on this theory. how\\nstrange it is that a bird, under the form of woodpecker, should have been\\ncreated to prey on insects on the ground; that upland geese, which never or\\nrarely swim, should have been created with webbed feet; that a thrush\\nshould have been created to dive and feed on sub-aquatic insects; and that\\na petrel should have been created with habits and structure fitting it for\\nthe life of an auk or grebe! and so on in endless other cases. but on the\\nview of each {472} species constantly trying to increase in number, with\\nnatural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying descendants of\\neach to any unoccupied or ill-occupied place in nature, these facts cease\\nto be strange, or perhaps might even have been anticipated.\\n\\nas natural selection acts by competition, it adapts the inhabitants of each\\ncountry only in relation to the degree of perfection of their associates;\\nso that we need feel no surprise at the inhabitants of any one country,\\nalthough on the ordinary view supposed to have been specially created and\\nadapted for that country, being beaten and supplanted by the naturalised\\nproductions from another land. nor ought we to marvel if all the\\ncontrivances in nature be not, as far as we can judge, absolutely perfect;\\nand if some of them be abhorrent to our ideas of fitness. we need not\\nmarvel at the sting of the bee causing the bee\\'s own death; at drones being\\nproduced in such vast numbers for one single act, with the great majority\\nslaughtered by their sterile sisters; at the astonishing waste of pollen by\\nour fir-trees; at the instinctive hatred of the queen bee for her own\\nfertile daughters; at ichneumonidг¦ feeding within the live bodies of\\ncaterpillars; and at other such cases. the wonder indeed is, on the theory\\nof natural selection, that more cases of the want of absolute perfection\\nhave not been observed.\\n\\nthe complex and little known laws governing variation are the same, as far\\nas we can see, with the laws which have governed the production of\\nso-called specific forms. in both cases physical conditions seem to have\\nproduced but little direct effect; yet when varieties enter any zone, they\\noccasionally assume some of the characters of the species proper to that\\nzone. in both varieties and species, use and disuse seem to have produced\\nsome effect; for it is difficult to resist this {473} conclusion when we\\nlook, for instance, at the logger-headed duck, which has wings incapable of\\nflight, in nearly the same condition as in the domestic duck; or when we\\nlook at the burrowing tucutucu, which is occasionally blind, and then at\\ncertain moles, which are habitually blind and have their eyes covered with\\nskin; or when we look at the blind animals inhabiting the dark caves of\\namerica and europe. in both varieties and species correlation of growth\\nseems to have played a most important part, so that when one part has been\\nmodified other parts are necessarily modified. in both varieties and\\nspecies reversions to long-lost characters occur. how inexplicable on the\\ntheory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulder\\nand legs of the several species of the horse-genus and in their hybrids!\\nhow simply is this fact explained if we believe that these species have\\ndescended from a striped progenitor, in the same manner as the several\\ndomestic breeds of pigeon have descended from the blue and barred\\nrock-pigeon!\\n\\non the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, why\\nshould the specific characters, or those by which the species of the same\\ngenus differ from each other, be more variable than the generic characters\\nin which they all agree? why, for instance, should the colour of a flower\\nbe more likely to vary in any one species of a genus, if the other species,\\nsupposed to have been created independently, have differently coloured\\nflowers, than if all the species of the genus have the same coloured\\nflowers? if species are only well-marked varieties, of which the characters\\nhave become in a high degree permanent, we can understand this fact; for\\nthey have already varied since they branched off from a common progenitor\\nin certain characters, by which they have come to be specifically distinct\\nfrom each other; {474} and therefore these same characters would be more\\nlikely still to be variable than the generic characters which have been\\ninherited without change for an enormous period. it is inexplicable on the\\ntheory of creation why a part developed in a very unusual manner in any one\\nspecies of a genus, and therefore, as we may naturally infer, of great\\nimportance to the species, should be eminently liable to variation; but, on\\nmy view, this part has undergone, since the several species branched off\\nfrom a common progenitor, an unusual amount of variability and\\nmodification, and therefore we might expect this part generally to be still\\nvariable. but a part may be developed in the most unusual manner, like the\\nwing of a bat, and yet not be more variable than any other structure, if\\nthe part be common to many subordinate forms, that is, if it has been\\ninherited for a very long period; for in this case it will have been\\nrendered constant by long-continued natural selection.\\n\\nglancing at instincts, marvellous as some are, they offer no greater\\ndifficulty than does corporeal structure on the theory of the natural\\nselection of successive, slight, but profitable modifications. we can thus\\nunderstand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing different\\nanimals of the same class with their several instincts. i have attempted to\\nshow how much light the principle of gradation throws on the admirable\\narchitectural powers of the hive-bee. habit no doubt sometimes comes into\\nplay in modifying instincts; but it certainly is not indispensable, as we\\nsee, in the case of neuter insects, which leave no progeny to inherit the\\neffects of long-continued habit. on the view of all the species of the same\\ngenus having descended from a common parent, and having inherited much in\\ncommon, we can understand how it is that allied species, when placed under\\nconsiderably different conditions of life, {475} yet should follow nearly\\nthe same instincts; why the thrush of south america, for instance, lines\\nher nest with mud like our british species. on the view of instincts having\\nbeen slowly acquired through natural selection we need not marvel at some\\ninstincts being apparently not perfect and liable to mistakes, and at many\\ninstincts causing other animals to suffer.\\n\\nif species be only well-marked and permanent varieties, we can at once see\\nwhy their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws in their\\ndegrees and kinds of resemblance to their parents,--in being absorbed into\\neach other by successive crosses, and in other such points,--as do the\\ncrossed offspring of acknowledged varieties. on the other hand, these would\\nbe strange facts if species have been independently created, and varieties\\nhave been produced by secondary laws.\\n\\nif we admit that the geological record is imperfect in an extreme degree,\\nthen such facts as the record gives, support the theory of descent with\\nmodification. new species have come on the stage slowly and at successive\\nintervals; and the amount of change, after equal intervals of time, is\\nwidely different in different groups. the extinction of species and of\\nwhole groups of species, which has played so conspicuous a part in the\\nhistory of the organic world, almost inevitably follows on the principle of\\nnatural selection; for old forms will be supplanted by new and improved\\nforms. neither single species nor groups of species reappear when the chain\\nof ordinary generation has once been broken. the gradual diffusion of\\ndominant forms, with the slow modification of their descendants, causes the\\nforms of life, after long intervals of time, to appear as if they had\\nchanged simultaneously throughout the world. the fact of the fossil remains\\nof each formation being in some degree intermediate in character between\\nthe {476} fossils in the formations above and below, is simply explained by\\ntheir intermediate position in the chain of descent. the grand fact that\\nall extinct organic beings belong to the same system with recent beings,\\nfalling either into the same or into intermediate groups, follows from the\\nliving and the extinct being the offspring of common parents. as the groups\\nwhich have descended from an ancient progenitor have generally diverged in\\ncharacter, the progenitor with its early descendants will often be\\nintermediate in character in comparison with its later descendants; and\\nthus we can see why the more ancient a fossil is, the oftener it stands in\\nsome degree intermediate between existing and allied groups. recent forms\\nare generally looked at as being, in some vague sense, higher than ancient\\nand extinct forms; and they are in so far higher as the later and more\\nimproved forms have conquered the older and less improved organic beings in\\nthe struggle for life. lastly, the law of the long endurance of allied\\nforms on the same continent,--of marsupials in australia, of edentata in\\namerica, and other such cases,--is intelligible, for within a confined\\ncountry, the recent and the extinct will naturally be allied by descent.\\n\\nlooking to geographical distribution, if we admit that there has been\\nduring the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world to\\nanother, owing to former climatal and geographical changes and to the many\\noccasional and unknown means of dispersal, then we can understand, on the\\ntheory of descent with modification, most of the great leading facts in\\ndistribution. we can see why there should be so striking a parallelism in\\nthe distribution of organic beings throughout space, and in their\\ngeological succession throughout time; for in both cases the beings have\\nbeen connected by the bond of ordinary generation, and the means of {477}\\nmodification have been the same. we see the full meaning of the wonderful\\nfact, which must have struck every traveller, namely, that on the same\\ncontinent, under the most diverse conditions, under heat and cold, on\\nmountain and lowland, on deserts and marshes, most of the inhabitants\\nwithin each great class are plainly related; for they will generally be\\ndescendants of the same progenitors and early colonists. on this same\\nprinciple of former migration, combined in most cases with modification, we\\ncan understand, by the aid of the glacial period, the identity of some few\\nplants, and the close alliance of many others, on the most distant\\nmountains, under the most different climates; and likewise the close\\nalliance of some of the inhabitants of the sea in the northern and southern\\ntemperate zones, though separated by the whole intertropical ocean.\\nalthough two areas may present the same physical conditions of life, we\\nneed feel no surprise at their inhabitants being widely different, if they\\nhave been for a long period completely separated from each other; for as\\nthe relation of organism to organism is the most important of all\\nrelations, and as the two areas will have received colonists from some\\nthird source or from each other, at various periods and in different\\nproportions, the course of modification in the two areas will inevitably be\\ndifferent.\\n\\non this view of migration, with subsequent modification, we can see why\\noceanic islands should be inhabited by few species, but of these, that many\\nshould be peculiar. we can clearly see why those animals which cannot cross\\nwide spaces of ocean, as frogs and terrestrial mammals, should not inhabit\\noceanic islands; and why, on the other hand, new and peculiar species of\\nbats, which can traverse the ocean, should so often be found on islands far\\ndistant from any continent. such facts {478} as the presence of peculiar\\nspecies of bats, and the absence of all other mammals, on oceanic islands,\\nare utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of creation.\\n\\nthe existence of closely allied or representative species in any two areas,\\nimplies, on the theory of descent with modification, that the same parents\\nformerly inhabited both areas; and we almost invariably find that wherever\\nmany closely allied species inhabit two areas, some identical species\\ncommon to both still exist. wherever many closely allied yet distinct\\nspecies occur, many doubtful forms and varieties of the same species\\nlikewise occur. it is a rule of high generality that the inhabitants of\\neach area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest source whence\\nimmigrants might have been derived. we see this in nearly all the plants\\nand animals of the galapagos archipelago, of juan fernandez, and of the\\nother american islands being related in the most striking manner to the\\nplants and animals of the neighbouring american mainland; and those of the\\ncape de verde archipelago and other african islands to the african\\nmainland. it must be admitted that these facts receive no explanation on\\nthe theory of creation.\\n\\nthe fact, as we have seen, that all past and present organic beings\\nconstitute one grand natural system, with group subordinate to group, and\\nwith extinct groups often falling in between recent groups, is intelligible\\non the theory of natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and\\ndivergence of character. on these same principles we see how it is, that\\nthe mutual affinities of the species and genera within each class are so\\ncomplex and circuitous. we see why certain characters are far more\\nserviceable than others for classification;--why adaptive characters,\\nthough of paramount importance to the being, are of hardly any {479}\\nimportance in classification; why characters derived from rudimentary\\nparts, though of no service to the being, are often of high classificatory\\nvalue; and why embryological characters are the most valuable of all. the\\nreal affinities of all organic beings are due to inheritance or community\\nof descent. the natural system is a genealogical arrangement, in which we\\nhave to discover the lines of descent by the most permanent characters,\\nhowever slight their vital importance may be.\\n\\nthe framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat,\\nfin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse,--the same number of vertebrг¦\\nforming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant,--and innumerable other\\nsuch facts, at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow\\nand slight successive modifications. the similarity of pattern in the wing\\nand leg of a bat, though used for such different purpose,--in the jaws and\\nlegs of a crab,--in the petals, stamens, and pistils of a flower, is\\nlikewise intelligible on the view of the gradual modification of parts or\\norgans, which were alike in the early progenitor of each class. on the\\nprinciple of successive variations not always supervening at an early age,\\nand being inherited at a corresponding not early period of life, we can\\nclearly see why the embryos of mammals, birds, reptiles, and fishes should\\nbe so closely alike, and should be so unlike the adult forms. we may cease\\nmarvelling at the embryo of an air-breathing mammal or bird having\\nbranchial slits and arteries running in loops, like those in a fish which\\nhas to breathe the air dissolved in water, by the aid of well-developed\\nbranchiг¦.\\n\\ndisuse, aided sometimes by natural selection, will often tend to reduce an\\norgan, when it has become useless by changed habits or under changed\\nconditions {480} of life; and we can clearly understand on this view the\\nmeaning of rudimentary organs. but disuse and selection will generally act\\non each creature, when it has come to maturity and has to play its full\\npart in the struggle for existence, and will thus have little power of\\nacting on an organ during early life; hence the organ will not be much\\nreduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age. the calf, for instance,\\nhas inherited teeth, which never cut through the gums of the upper jaw,\\nfrom an early progenitor having well-developed teeth; and we may believe,\\nthat the teeth in the mature animal were reduced, during successive\\ngenerations, by disuse or by the tongue and palate having been better\\nfitted by natural selection to browse without their aid; whereas in the\\ncalf, the teeth have been left untouched by selection or disuse, and on the\\nprinciple of inheritance at corresponding ages have been inherited from a\\nremote period to the present day. on the view of each organic being and\\neach separate organ having been specially created, how utterly inexplicable\\nit is that parts, like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the\\nshrivelled wings under the soldered wing-covers of some beetles, should\\nthus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility! nature may be said to\\nhave taken pains to reveal, by rudimentary organs and by homologous\\nstructures, her scheme of modification, which it seems that we wilfully\\nwill not understand.\\n\\n\\n\\ni have now recapitulated the chief facts and considerations which have\\nthoroughly convinced me that species have been modified, during a long\\ncourse of descent, by the preservation or the natural selection of many\\nsuccessive slight favourable variations. i cannot believe that a false\\ntheory would explain, as it seems to me that the theory of natural\\nselection does explain, {481} the several large classes of facts above\\nspecified. i see no good reason why the views given in this volume should\\nshock the religious feelings of any one. a celebrated author and divine has\\nwritten to me that \"he has gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble\\na conception of the deity to believe that he created a few original forms\\ncapable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe\\nthat he required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the\\naction of his laws.\"\\n\\nwhy, it may be asked, have all the most eminent living naturalists and\\ngeologists rejected this view of the mutability of species? it cannot be\\nasserted that organic beings in a state of nature are subject to no\\nvariation; it cannot be proved that the amount of variation in the course\\nof long ages is a limited quantity; no clear distinction has been, or can\\nbe, drawn between species and well-marked varieties. it cannot be\\nmaintained that species when intercrossed are invariably sterile, and\\nvarieties invariably fertile; or that sterility is a special endowment and\\nsign of creation. the belief that species were immutable productions was\\nalmost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was thought to be of\\nshort duration; and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of\\ntime, we are too apt to assume, without proof, that the geological record\\nis so perfect that it would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation\\nof species, if they had undergone mutation.\\n\\nbut the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species\\nhas given birth to other and distinct species, is that we are always slow\\nin admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate\\nsteps. the difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when\\nlyell first insisted that long {482} lines of inland cliffs had been\\nformed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the coast-waves.\\nthe mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred\\nmillion years; it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many\\nslight variations, accumulated during an almost infinite number of\\ngenerations.\\n\\nalthough i am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this\\nvolume under the form of an abstract, i by no means expect to convince\\nexperienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts\\nall viewed, during a long course of years, from a point of view directly\\nopposite to mine. it is so easy to hide our ignorance under such\\nexpressions as the \"plan of creation,\" \"unity of design,\" &c., and to think\\nthat we give an explanation when we only restate a fact. any one whose\\ndisposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties\\nthan to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject\\nmy theory. a few naturalists, endowed with much flexibility of mind, and\\nwho have already begun to doubt on the immutability of species, may be\\ninfluenced by this volume; but i look with confidence to the future, to\\nyoung and rising naturalists, who will be able to view both sides of the\\nquestion with impartiality. whoever is led to believe that species are\\nmutable will do good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction;\\nfor only thus can the load of prejudice by which this subject is\\noverwhelmed be removed.\\n\\nseveral eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that a\\nmultitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species; but that\\nother species are real, that is, have been independently created. this\\nseems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at. they admit that a multitude\\nof forms, which till lately {483} they themselves thought were special\\ncreations, and which are still thus looked at by the majority of\\nnaturalists, and which consequently have every external characteristic\\nfeature of true species,--they admit that these have been produced by\\nvariation, but they refuse to extend the same view to other and very\\nslightly different forms. nevertheless they do not pretend that they can\\ndefine, or even conjecture, which are the created forms of life, and which\\nare those produced by secondary laws. they admit variation as a _vera\\ncausa_ in one case, they arbitrarily reject it in another, without\\nassigning any distinction in the two cases. the day will come when this\\nwill be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived\\nopinion. these authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of\\ncreation than at an ordinary birth. but do they really believe that at\\ninnumerable periods in the earth\\'s history certain elemental atoms have\\nbeen commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues? do they believe that\\nat each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced? were\\nall the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or\\nseed, or as full grown? and in the case of mammals, were they created\\nbearing the false marks of nourishment from the mother\\'s womb? although\\nnaturalists very properly demand a full explanation of every difficulty\\nfrom those who believe in the mutability of species, on their own side they\\nignore the whole subject of the first appearance of species in what they\\nconsider reverent silence.\\n\\nit may be asked how far i extend the doctrine of the modification of\\nspecies. the question is difficult to answer, because the more distinct the\\nforms are which we may consider, by so much the arguments fall away in\\nforce. but some arguments of the greatest weight {484} extend very far. all\\nthe members of whole classes can be connected together by chains of\\naffinities, and all can be classified on the same principle, in groups\\nsubordinate to groups. fossil remains sometimes tend to fill up very wide\\nintervals between existing orders. organs in a rudimentary condition\\nplainly show that an early progenitor had the organ in a fully developed\\nstate; and this in some instances necessarily implies an enormous amount of\\nmodification in the descendants. throughout whole classes various\\nstructures are formed on the same pattern, and at an embryonic age the\\nspecies closely resemble each other. therefore i cannot doubt that the\\ntheory of descent with modification embraces all the members of the same\\nclass. i believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five\\nprogenitors, and plants from an equal or lesser number.\\n\\nanalogy would lead me one step further, namely, to the belief that all\\nanimals and plants have descended from some one prototype. but analogy may\\nbe a deceitful guide. nevertheless all living things have much in common,\\nin their chemical composition, their germinal vesicles, their cellular\\nstructure, and their laws of growth and reproduction. we see this even in\\nso trifling a circumstance as that the same poison often similarly affects\\nplants and animals; or that the poison secreted by the gall-fly produces\\nmonstrous growths on the wild rose or oak-tree. therefore i should infer\\nfrom analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on\\nthis earth have descended from some one primordial form, into which life\\nwas first breathed by the creator.\\n\\n\\n\\nwhen the views advanced by me in this volume, and by mr. wallace in the\\nlinnean journal, or when analogous views on the origin of species are\\ngenerally {485} admitted, we can dimly foresee that there will be a\\nconsiderable revolution in natural history. systematists will be able to\\npursue their labours as at present; but they will not be incessantly\\nhaunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be in essence a\\nspecies. this i feel sure, and i speak after experience, will be no slight\\nrelief. the endless disputes whether or not some fifty species of british\\nbrambles are true species will cease. systematists will have only to decide\\n(not that this will be easy) whether any form be sufficiently constant and\\ndistinct from other forms, to be capable of definition; and if definable,\\nwhether the differences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific\\nname. this latter point will become a far more essential consideration than\\nit is at present; for differences, however slight, between any two forms,\\nif not blended by intermediate gradations, are looked at by most\\nnaturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species.\\nhereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction\\nbetween species and well-marked varieties is, that the latter are known, or\\nbelieved, to be connected at the present day by intermediate gradations,\\nwhereas species were formerly thus connected. hence, without rejecting the\\nconsideration of the present existence of intermediate gradations between\\nany two forms, we shall be led to weigh more carefully and to value higher\\nthe actual amount of difference between them. it is quite possible that\\nforms now generally acknowledged to be merely varieties may hereafter be\\nthought worthy of specific names, as with the primrose and cowslip; and in\\nthis case scientific and common language will come into accordance. in\\nshort, we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those\\nnaturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial\\ncombinations {486} made for convenience. this may not be a cheering\\nprospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the\\nundiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species.\\n\\nthe other and more general departments of natural history will rise greatly\\nin interest. the terms used by naturalists of affinity, relationship,\\ncommunity of type, paternity, morphology, adaptive characters, rudimentary\\nand aborted organs, &c., will cease to be metaphorical, and will have a\\nplain signification. when we no longer look at an organic being as a savage\\nlooks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his comprehension; when we\\nregard every production of nature as one which has had a history; when we\\ncontemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many\\ncontrivances, each useful to the possessor, nearly in the same way as when\\nwe look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour,\\nthe experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen; when\\nwe thus view each organic being, how far more interesting, i speak from\\nexperience, will the study of natural history become!\\n\\na grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened, on the causes\\nand laws of variation, on correlation of growth, on the effects of use and\\ndisuse, on the direct action of external conditions, and so forth. the\\nstudy of domestic productions will rise immensely in value. a new variety\\nraised by man will be a more important and interesting subject for study\\nthan one more species added to the infinitude of already recorded species.\\nour classifications will come to be, as far as they can be so made,\\ngenealogies; and will then truly give what may be called the plan of\\ncreation. the rules for classifying will no doubt become simpler when we\\nhave a definite object in view. we possess no {487} pedigrees or armorial\\nbearings; and we have to discover and trace the many diverging lines of\\ndescent in our natural genealogies, by characters of any kind which have\\nlong been inherited. rudimentary organs will speak infallibly with respect\\nto the nature of long-lost structures. species and groups of species, which\\nare called aberrant, and which may fancifully be called living fossils,\\nwill aid us in forming a picture of the ancient forms of life. embryology\\nwill reveal to us the structure, in some degree obscured, of the prototypes\\nof each great class.\\n\\nwhen we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species, and\\nall the closely allied species of most genera, have within a not very\\nremote period descended from one parent, and have migrated from some one\\nbirthplace; and when we better know the many means of migration, then, by\\nthe light which geology now throws, and will continue to throw, on former\\nchanges of climate and of the level of the land, we shall surely be enabled\\nto trace in an admirable manner the former migrations of the inhabitants of\\nthe whole world. even at present, by comparing the differences of the\\ninhabitants of the sea on the opposite sides of a continent, and the nature\\nof the various inhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent\\nmeans of immigration, some light can be thrown on ancient geography.\\n\\nthe noble science of geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of\\nthe record. the crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be\\nlooked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made at hazard\\nand at rare intervals. the accumulation of each great fossiliferous\\nformation will be recognised as having depended on an unusual concurrence\\nof circumstances, and the blank intervals between the successive stages as\\nhaving been of vast duration. but we shall {488} be able to gauge with some\\nsecurity the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding\\nand succeeding organic forms. we must be cautious in attempting to\\ncorrelate as strictly contemporaneous two formations, which include few\\nidentical species, by the general succession of their forms of life. as\\nspecies are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing\\ncauses, and not by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes; and as\\nthe most important of all causes of organic change is one which is almost\\nindependent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions,\\nnamely, the mutual relation of organism to organism,--the improvement of\\none being entailing the improvement or the extermination of others; it\\nfollows, that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive\\nformations probably serves as a fair measure of the lapse of actual time. a\\nnumber of species, however, keeping in a body might remain for a long\\nperiod unchanged, whilst within this same period, several of these species,\\nby migrating into new countries and coming into competition with foreign\\nassociates, might become modified; so that we must not overrate the\\naccuracy of organic change as a measure of time. during early periods of\\nthe earth\\'s history, when the forms of life were probably fewer and\\nsimpler, the rate of change was probably slower; and at the first dawn of\\nlife, when very few forms of the simplest structure existed, the rate of\\nchange may have been slow in an extreme degree. the whole history of the\\nworld, as at present known, although of a length quite incomprehensible by\\nus, will hereafter be recognised as a mere fragment of time, compared with\\nthe ages which have elapsed since the first creature, the progenitor of\\ninnumerable extinct and living descendants, was created.\\n\\nin the distant future i see open fields for far more {489} important\\nresearches. psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the\\nnecessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. light\\nwill be thrown on the origin of man and his history.\\n\\nauthors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view\\nthat each species has been independently created. to my mind it accords\\nbetter with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the creator,\\nthat the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of\\nthe world should have been due to secondary causes, like those determining\\nthe birth and death of the individual. when i view all beings not as\\nspecial creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which\\nlived long before the first bed of the silurian system was deposited, they\\nseem to me to become ennobled. judging from the past, we may safely infer\\nthat not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a\\ndistant futurity. and of the species now living very few will transmit\\nprogeny of any kind to a far distant futurity; for the manner in which all\\norganic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species of\\neach genus, and all the species of many genera, have left no descendants,\\nbut have become utterly extinct. we can so far take a prophetic glance into\\nfuturity as to foretel that it will be the common and widely-spread\\nspecies, belonging to the larger and dominant groups, which will ultimately\\nprevail and procreate new and dominant species. as all the living forms of\\nlife are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the\\nsilurian epoch, we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by\\ngeneration has never once been broken, and that no cataclysm has desolated\\nthe whole world. hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future\\nof equally inappreciable length. and as natural selection works {490}\\nsolely by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental\\nendowments will tend to progress towards perfection.\\n\\nit is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank, clothed with many\\nplants of many kinds, with birds singing on the bushes, with various\\ninsects flitting about, and with worms crawling through the damp earth, and\\nto reflect that these elaborately constructed forms, so different from each\\nother, and dependent on each other in so complex a manner, have all been\\nproduced by laws acting around us. these laws, taken in the largest sense,\\nbeing growth with reproduction; inheritance which is almost implied by\\nreproduction; variability from the indirect and direct action of the\\nexternal conditions of life, and from use and disuse; a ratio of increase\\nso high as to lead to a struggle for life, and as a consequence to natural\\nselection, entailing divergence of character and the extinction of\\nless-improved forms. thus, from the war of nature, from famine and death,\\nthe most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving, namely, the\\nproduction of the higher animals, directly follows. there is grandeur in\\nthis view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed\\nby the creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet\\nhas gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a\\nbeginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and\\nare being, evolved.\\n\\n       *       *       *       *

introduction when on board h m s beagle as naturalist i was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of south america and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent these facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species that mystery of mysteries as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers on my return home it occurred to me in 1837 that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it after five years work i allowed myself to speculate on the subject and drew up some short notes these i enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions which then seemed to me probable from that period to the present day i have steadily pursued the same object i hope that i may be excused for entering on these personal details as i give them to show that i have not been hasty in coming to a decision my work is now nearly finished but as it will take me two or three more years to complete it and as my health is far from strong i have been urged to publish this abstract i have more especially been induced to do this as mr wallace who is now studying the 2 natural history of the malay archipelago has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that i have on the origin of species last year he sent me a memoir on this subject with a request that i would forward it to sir charles lyell who sent it to the linnean society and it is published in the third volume of the journal of that society sir c lyell and dr hooker who both knew of my work the latter having read my sketch of 1844 honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish with mr wallace s excellent memoir some brief extracts from my manuscripts this abstract which i now publish must necessarily be imperfect i cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements and i must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy no doubt errors will have crept in though i hope i have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone i can here give only the general conclusions at which i have arrived with a few facts in illustration but which i hope in most cases will suffice no one can feel more sensible than i do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts with references on which my conclusions have been grounded and i hope in a future work to do this for i am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts cannot be adduced often apparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which i have arrived a fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question and this cannot possibly be here done i much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of acknowledging the generous assistance which i have received from very many naturalists some of them personally unknown to me i cannot however 3 let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to dr hooker who for the last fifteen years has aided me in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment in considering the origin of species it is quite conceivable that a naturalist reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings on their embryological relations their geographical distribution geological succession and other such facts might come to the conclusion that each species had not been independently created but had descended like varieties from other species nevertheless such a conclusion even if well founded would be unsatisfactory until it could be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly excites our admiration naturalists continually refer to external conditions such as climate food c as the only possible cause of variation in one very limited sense as we shall hereafter see this may be true but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions the structure for instance of the woodpecker with its feet tail beak and tongue so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees in the case of the misseltoe which draws its nourishment from certain trees which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds and which has flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one flower to the other it is equally preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite with its relations to several distinct organic beings by the effects of external conditions or of habit or of the volition of the plant itself the author of the vestiges of creation would i presume say that after a certain unknown number of 4 generations some bird had given birth to a woodpecker and some plant to the missletoe and that these had been produced perfect as we now see them but this assumption seems to me to be no explanation for it leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life untouched and unexplained it is therefore of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into the means of modification and coadaptation at the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out this obscure problem nor have i been disappointed in this and in all other perplexing cases i have invariably found that our knowledge imperfect though it be of variation under domestication afforded the best and safest clue i may venture to express my conviction of the high value of such studies although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists from these considerations i shall devote the first chapter of this abstract to variation under domestication we shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible and what is equally or more important we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his selection successive slight variations i will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature but i shall unfortunately be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts we shall however be enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to variation in the next chapter the struggle for existence amongst all organic beings throughout the world which inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of their 5 increase will be treated of this is the doctrine of malthus applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms as many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive and as consequently there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence it follows that any being if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life will have a better chance of surviving and thus be naturally selected from the strong principle of inheritance any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form this fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at some length in the fourth chapter and we shall then see how natural selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved forms of life and leads to what i have called divergence of character in the next chapter i shall discuss the complex and little known laws of variation and of correlation of growth in the four succeeding chapters the most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will be given namely first the difficulties of transitions or in understanding how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed being or elaborately constructed organ secondly the subject of instinct or the mental powers of animals thirdly hybridism or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed and fourthly the imperfection of the geological record in the next chapter i shall consider the geological succession of organic beings throughout time in the eleventh and twelfth their geographical distribution throughout space in the thirteenth their classification or mutual affinities both when mature and in an embryonic condition in the last chapter i shall give a 6 brief recapitulation of the whole work and a few concluding remarks no one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard to the origin of species and varieties if he makes due allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of all the beings which live around us who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare yet these relations are of the highest importance for they determine the present welfare and as i believe the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world still less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its history although much remains obscure and will long remain obscure i can entertain no doubt after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which i am capable that the view which most naturalists entertain and which i formerly entertained namely that each species has been independently created is erroneous i am fully convinced that species are not immutable but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species furthermore i am convinced that natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification 7 chapter i variation under domestication causes of variability effects of habit correlation of growth inheritance character of domestic varieties difficulty of distinguishing between varieties and species origin of domestic varieties from one or more species domestic pigeons their differences and origin principle of selection anciently followed its effects methodical and unconscious selection unknown origin of our domestic productions circumstances favourable to man s power of selection when we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub variety of our older cultivated plants and animals one of the first points which strikes us is that they generally differ more from each other than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature when we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment i think we are driven to conclude that this great variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as and somewhat different from those to which the parent species have been exposed under nature there is also i think some probability in the view propounded by andrew knight that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food it seems pretty clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to the new conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation and that when the organisation has once begun to vary it generally continues to vary for many generations 8 no case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under cultivation our oldest cultivated plants such as wheat still often yield new varieties our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification it has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability whatever they may be generally act whether during the early or late period of development of the embryo or at the instant of conception geoffroy st hilaire s experiments show that unnatural treatment of the embryo causes monstrosities and monstrosities cannot be separated by any clear line of distinction from mere variations but i am strongly inclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the act of conception several reasons make me believe in this but the chief one is the remarkable effect which confinement or cultivation has on the function of the reproductive system this system appearing to be far more susceptible than any other part of the organisation to the action of any change in the conditions of life nothing is more easy than to tame an animal and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement even in the many cases when the male and female unite how many animals there are which will not breed though living long under not very close confinement in their native country this is generally attributed to vitiated instincts but how many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour and yet rarely or never seed in some few such cases it has been discovered that very trifling changes such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth will determine whether or not the plant sets a seed i cannot here enter on the copious details which i have collected on 9 this curious subject but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement i may just mention that carnivorous animals even from the tropics breed in this country pretty freely under confinement with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family whereas carnivorous birds with the rarest exceptions hardly ever lay fertile eggs many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless in the same exact condition as in the most sterile hybrids when on the one hand we see domesticated animals and plants though often weak and sickly yet breeding quite freely under confinement and when on the other hand we see individuals though taken young from a state of nature perfectly tamed long lived and healthy of which i could give numerous instances yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting we need not be surprised at this system when it does act under confinement acting not quite regularly and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents sterility has been said to be the bane of horticulture but on this view we owe variability to the same cause which produces sterility and variability is the source of all the choicest productions of the garden i may add that as some organisms will breed freely under the most unnatural conditions for instance the rabbit and ferret kept in hutches showing that their reproductive system has not been thus affected so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation and vary very slightly perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature a long list could easily be given of sporting plants by this term gardeners mean a single bud or offset which suddenly assumes a new and sometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant 10 such buds can be propagated by grafting c and sometimes by seed these sports are extremely rare under nature but far from rare under cultivation and in this case we see that the treatment of the parent has affected a bud or offset and not the ovules or pollen but it is the opinion of most physiologists that there is no essential difference between a bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation so that in fact sports support my view that variability may be largely attributed to the ovules or pollen or to both having been affected by the treatment of the parent prior to the act of conception these cases anyhow show that variation is not necessarily connected as some authors have supposed with the act of generation seedlings from the same fruit and the young of the same litter sometimes differ considerably from each other though both the young and the parents as mгјller has remarked have apparently been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life and this shows how unimportant the direct effects of the conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of reproduction of growth and of inheritance for had the action of the conditions been direct if any of the young had varied all would probably have varied in the same manner to judge how much in the case of any variation we should attribute to the direct action of heat moisture light food c is most difficult my impression is that with animals such agencies have produced very little direct effect though apparently more in the case of plants under this point of view mr buckman s recent experiments on plants are extremely valuable when all or nearly all the individuals exposed to certain conditions are affected in the same way the change at first appears to be directly due to such conditions but in some cases it can be shown that quite opposite conditions produce 11 similar changes of structure nevertheless some slight amount of change may i think be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of life as in some cases increased size from amount of food colour from particular kinds of food or from light and perhaps the thickness of fur from climate habit also has a decided influence as in the period of flowering with plants when transported from one climate to another in animals it has a more marked effect for instance i find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more in proportion to the whole skeleton than do the same bones in the wild duck and i presume that this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less and walking more than its wild parent the great and inherited development of the udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked in comparison with the state of these organs in other countries is another instance of the effect of use not a single domestic animal can be named which has not in some country drooping ears and the view suggested by some authors that the drooping is due to the disuse of the muscles of the ear from the animals not being much alarmed by danger seems probable there are many laws regulating variation some few of which can be dimly seen and will be hereafter briefly mentioned i will here only allude to what may be called correlation of growth any change in the embryo or larva will almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal in monstrosities the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious and many instances are given in isidore geoffroy st hilaire s great work on this subject breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied by an elongated head some instances of correlation are quite whimsical thus 12 cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf colour and constitutional peculiarities go together of which many remarkable cases could be given amongst animals and plants from the facts collected by heusinger it appears that white sheep and pigs are differently affected from coloured individuals by certain vegetable poisons hairless dogs have imperfect teeth long haired and coarse haired animals are apt to have as is asserted long or many horns pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes pigeons with short beaks have small feet and those with long beaks large feet hence if man goes on selecting and thus augmenting any peculiarity he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other parts of the structure owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation of growth the result of the various quite unknown or dimly seen laws of variation is infinitely complex and diversified it is well worth while carefully to study the several treatises published on some of our old cultivated plants as on the hyacinth potato even the dahlia c and it is really surprising to note the endless points in structure and constitution in which the varieties and sub varieties differ slightly from each other the whole organisation seems to have become plastic and tends to depart in some small degree from that of the parental type any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us but the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance is endless dr prosper lucas s treatise in two large volumes is the fullest and the best on this subject no breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance like produces like is his fundamental belief doubts have been thrown on this principle by theoretical writers alone when any deviation of structure often appears and we see it in the 13 father and child we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same cause having acted on both but when amongst individuals apparently exposed to the same conditions any very rare deviation due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances appears in the parent say once amongst several million individuals and it reappears in the child the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance every one must have heard of cases of albinism prickly skin hairy bodies c appearing in several members of the same family if strange and rare deviations of structure are truly inherited less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject would be to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule and non inheritance as the anomaly the laws governing inheritance are quite unknown no one can say why a peculiarity in different individuals of the same species or in individuals of different species is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so why the child often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or grandmother or other more remote ancestor why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes or to one sex alone more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex it is a fact of some little importance to us that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted either exclusively or in a much greater degree to males alone a much more important rule which i think may be trusted is that at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears it tends to appear in the offspring at a corresponding age though sometimes earlier in many cases this could not be otherwise thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in 14 the offspring when nearly mature peculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage but hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension and that when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent i believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology these remarks are of course confined to the first appearance of the peculiarity and not to its primary cause which may have acted on the ovules or male element in nearly the same manner as in the crossed offspring from a short horned cow by a long horned bull the greater length of horn though appearing late in life is clearly due to the male element having alluded to the subject of reversion i may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists namely that our domestic varieties when run wild gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal stocks hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature i have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made there would be great difficulty in proving its truth we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state in many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued it would be quite necessary in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home nevertheless as our varieties certainly do occasionally 15 revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms it seems to me not improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising or were to cultivate during many generations the several races for instance of the cabbage in very poor soil in which case however some effect would have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil that they would to a large extent or even wholly revert to the wild aboriginal stock whether or not the experiment would succeed is not of great importance for our line of argument for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed if it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion that is to lose their acquired characters whilst kept under the same conditions and whilst kept in a considerable body so that free intercrossing might check by blending together any slight deviations in their structure in such case i grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species but there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view to assert that we could not breed our cart and race horses long and short horned cattle and poultry of various breeds and esculent vegetables for an almost infinite number of generations would be opposed to all experience i may add that when under nature the conditions of life do change variations and reversions of character probably do occur but natural selection as will hereafter be explained will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be preserved when we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants and compare them with closely allied species we generally perceive in each domestic race as already remarked less uniformity of character than in true species domestic races of the same species also often have a somewhat monstrous character by which i mean that although differing 16 from each other and from other species of the same genus in several trifling respects they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part both when compared one with another and more especially when compared with all the species in nature to which they are nearest allied with these exceptions and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed a subject hereafter to be discussed domestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as only in most cases in a lesser degree than do closely allied species of the same genus in a state of nature i think this must be admitted when we find that there are hardly any domestic races either amongst animals or plants which have not been ranked by competent judges as mere varieties and by other competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species if any marked distinction existed between domestic races and species this source of doubt could not so perpetually recur it has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value i think it could be shown that this statement is hardly correct but naturalists differ widely in determining what characters are of generic value all such valuations being at present empirical moreover on the view of the origin of genera which i shall presently give we have no right to expect often to meet with generic differences in our domesticated productions when we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between the domestic races of the same species we are soon involved in doubt from not knowing whether they have descended from one or several parent species this point if it could be cleared up would be interesting if for instance it could be shown that the greyhound bloodhound terrier spaniel and bull dog which we all know propagate their kind so truly were the 17 offspring of any single species then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many very closely allied natural species for instance of the many foxes inhabiting different quarters of the world i do not believe as we shall presently see that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of the dog has been produced under domestication i believe that some small part of the difference is due to their being descended from distinct species in the case of some other domesticated species there is presumptive or even strong evidence that all the breeds have descended from a single wild stock it has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary and likewise to withstand diverse climates i do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions but how could a savage possibly know when he first tamed an animal whether it would vary in succeeding generations and whether it would endure other climates has the little variability of the ass or guinea fowl or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer or of cold by the common camel prevented their domestication i cannot doubt that if other animals and plants equal in number to our domesticated productions and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries were taken from a state of nature and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication they would vary on an average as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied in the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants i do not think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion whether they have descended from one or several wild species the argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin 18 of our domestic animals is that we find in the most ancient records more especially on the monuments of egypt much diversity in the breeds and that some of the breeds closely resemble perhaps are identical with those still existing even if this latter fact were found more strictly and generally true than seems to me to be the case what does it show but that some of our breeds originated there four or five thousand years ago but mr horner s researches have rendered it in some degree probable that man sufficiently civilized to have manufactured pottery existed in the valley of the nile thirteen or fourteen thousand years ago and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods savages like those of tierra del fuego or australia who possess a semi domestic dog may not have existed in egypt the whole subject must i think remain vague nevertheless i may without here entering on any details state that from geographical and other considerations i think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have descended from several wild species knowing as we do that savages are very fond of taming animals it seems to me unlikely in the case of the dog genus which is distributed in a wild state throughout the world that since man first appeared one single species alone should have been domesticated in regard to sheep and goats i can form no opinion i should think from facts communicated to me by mr blyth on the habits voice and constitution c of the humped indian cattle that these had descended from a different aboriginal stock from our european cattle and several competent judges believe that these latter have had more than one wild parent with respect to horses from reasons which i cannot give here i am doubtfully inclined to believe in opposition to several authors that all the races have descended from one 19 wild stock mr blyth whose opinion from his large and varied stores of knowledge i should value more than that of almost any one thinks that all the breeds of poultry have proceeded from the common wild indian fowl gallus bankiva in regard to ducks and rabbits the breeds of which differ considerably from each other in structure i do not doubt that they have all descended from the common wild duck and rabbit the doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors they believe that every race which breeds true let the distinctive characters be ever so slight has had its wild prototype at this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle as many sheep and several goats in europe alone and several even within great britain one author believes that there formerly existed in great britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it when we bear in mind that britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal and france but few distinct from those of germany and conversely and so with hungary spain c but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle sheep c we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in europe for whence could they have been derived as these several countries do not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parent stocks so it is in india even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world which i fully admit have probably descended from several wild species i cannot doubt that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation who can believe that animals closely resembling the italian greyhound the bloodhound the bull dog or blenheim spaniel c so unlike all wild canidг ever existed freely in a state of nature it has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have 20 been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species but by crossing we can only get forms in some degree intermediate between their parents and if we account for our several domestic races by this process we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms as the italian greyhound bloodhound bull dog c in the wild state moreover the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated there can be no doubt that a race may be modified by occasional crosses if aided by the careful selection of those individual mongrels which present any desired character but that a race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremely different races or species i can hardly believe sir j sebright expressly experimentised for this object and failed the offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes as i have found with pigeons extremely uniform and everything seems simple enough but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations hardly two of them will be alike and then the extreme difficulty or rather utter hopelessness of the task becomes apparent certainly a breed intermediate between two very distinct breeds could not be got without extreme care and long continued selection nor can i find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thus formed on the breeds of the domestic pigeon believing that it is always best to study some special group i have after deliberation taken up domestic pigeons i have kept every breed which i could purchase or obtain and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world more especially by the hon w elliot from india and by the hon c murray from persia many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons and some of them are very important as being of 21 considerable antiquity i have associated with several eminent fanciers and have been permitted to join two of the london pigeon clubs the diversity of the breeds is something astonishing compare the english carrier and the short faced tumbler and see the wonderful difference in their beaks entailing corresponding differences in their skulls the carrier more especially the male bird is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids very large external orifices to the nostrils and a wide gape of mouth the short faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch and the common tumbler has the singular inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock and tumbling in the air head over heels the runt is a bird of great size with long massive beak and large feet some of the sub breeds of runts have very long necks others very long wings and tails others singularly short tails the barb is allied to the carrier but instead of a very long beak has a very short and very broad one the pouter has a much elongated body wings and legs and its enormously developed crop which it glories in inflating may well excite astonishment and even laughter the turbit has a very short and conical beak with a line of reversed feathers down the breast and it has the habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of the oesophagus the jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood and it has proportionally to its size much elongated wing and tail feathers the trumpeter and laugher as their names express utter a very different coo from the other breeds the fantail has thirty or even forty tail feathers instead of twelve or fourteen the normal number in all members of the great pigeon family and these feathers are kept expanded and are 22 carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch the oil gland is quite aborted several other less distinct breeds might be specified in the skeletons of the several breeds the development of the bones of the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously the shape as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw varies in a highly remarkable manner the number of the caudal and sacral vertebrг vary as does the number of the ribs together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes the size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula the proportional width of the gape of mouth the proportional length of the eyelids of the orifice of the nostrils of the tongue not always in strict correlation with the length of beak the size of the crop and of the upper part of the oesophagus the development and abortion of the oil gland the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers the relative length of wing and tail to each other and to the body the relative length of leg and of the feet the number of scutellг on the toes the development of skin between the toes are all points of structure which are variable the period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched the shape and size of the eggs vary the manner of flight differs remarkably as does in some breeds the voice and disposition lastly in certain breeds the males and females have come to differ to a slight degree from each other altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen which if shown to an ornithologist and he were told that they were wild birds would certainly i think be ranked by him as well defined species moreover i do not believe that any ornithologist would place the 23 english carrier the short faced tumbler the runt the barb pouter and fantail in the same genus more especially as in each of these breeds several truly inherited sub breeds or species as he might have called them could be shown him great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons i am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct namely that all have descended from the rock pigeon columba livia including under this term several geographical races or sub species which differ from each other in the most trifling respects as several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases i will here briefly give them if the several breeds are not varieties and have not proceeded from the rock pigeon they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number how for instance could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop the supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rock pigeons that is not breeding or willingly perching on trees but besides c livia with its geographical sub species only two or three other species of rock pigeons are known and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated and yet be unknown to ornithologists and this considering their size habits and remarkable characters seems very improbable or they must have become extinct in the wild state but birds breeding on precipices and good fliers are unlikely to be exterminated and the common rock pigeon which has the same habits with the domestic breeds has not been exterminated 24 even on several of the smaller british islets or on the shores of the mediterranean hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock pigeon seems to me a very rash assumption moreover the several above named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world and therefore some of them must have been carried back again into their native country but not one has ever become wild or feral though the dovecot pigeon which is the rock pigeon in a very slightly altered state has become feral in several places again all recent experience shows that it is most difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under domestication yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half civilized man as to be quite prolific under confinement an argument as it seems to me of great weight and applicable in several other cases is that the above specified breeds though agreeing generally in constitution habits voice colouring and in most parts of their structure with the wild rock pigeon yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts of their structure we may look in vain throughout the whole great family of columbidг for a beak like that of the english carrier or that of the short faced tumbler or barb for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin for a crop like that of the pouter for tail feathers like those of the fantail hence it must be assumed not only that half civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species and further that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown so many strange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree 25 some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration the rock pigeon is of a slaty blue and has a white rump the indian subspecies c intermedia of strickland having it bluish the tail has a terminal dark bar with the bases of the outer feathers externally edged with white the wings have two black bars some semi domestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have besides the two black bars the wings chequered with black these several marks do not occur together in any other species of the whole family now in every one of the domestic breeds taking thoroughly well bred birds all the above marks even to the white edging of the outer tail feathers sometimes concur perfectly developed moreover when two birds belonging to two distinct breeds are crossed neither of which is blue or has any of the above specified marks the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters for instance i crossed some uniformly white fantails with some uniformly black barbs and they produced mottled brown and black birds these i again crossed together and one grandchild of the pure white fantail and pure black barb was of as beautiful a blue colour with the white rump double black wing bar and barred and white edged tail feathers as any wild rock pigeon we can understand these facts on the well known principle of reversion to ancestral characters if all the domestic breeds have descended from the rock pigeon but if we deny this we must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions either firstly that all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the rock pigeon although no other existing species is thus coloured and marked so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to revert to the very same colours and markings or secondly 26 that each breed even the purest has within a dozen or at most within a score of generations been crossed by the rock pigeon i say within a dozen or twenty generations for we know of no fact countenancing the belief that the child ever reverts to some one ancestor removed by a greater number of generations in a breed which has been crossed only once with some distinct breed the tendency to reversion to any character derived from such cross will naturally become less and less as in each succeeding generation there will be less of the foreign blood but when there has been no cross with a distinct breed and there is a tendency in both parents to revert to a character which has been lost during some former generation this tendency for all that we can see to the contrary may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations these two distinct cases are often confounded in treatises on inheritance lastly the hybrids or mongrels from between all the domestic breeds of pigeons are perfectly fertile i can state this from my own observations purposely made on the most distinct breeds now it is difficult perhaps impossible to bring forward one case of the hybrid offspring of two animals clearly distinct being themselves perfectly fertile some authors believe that long continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to sterility from the history of the dog i think there is some probability in this hypothesis if applied to species closely related together though it is unsupported by a single experiment but to extend the hypothesis so far as to suppose that species aboriginally as distinct as carriers tumblers pouters and fantails now are should yield offspring perfectly fertile inter se seems to me rash in the extreme from these several reasons namely the improbability of man having formerly got seven or eight supposed 27 species of pigeons to breed freely under domestication these supposed species being quite unknown in a wild state and their becoming nowhere feral these species having very abnormal characters in certain respects as compared with all other columbidг though so like in most other respects to the rock pigeon the blue colour and various marks occasionally appearing in all the breeds both when kept pure and when crossed the mongrel offspring being perfectly fertile from these several reasons taken together i can feel no doubt that all our domestic breeds have descended from the columba livia with its geographical sub species in favour of this view i may add firstly that c livia or the rock pigeon has been found capable of domestication in europe and in india and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all the domestic breeds secondly although an english carrier or short faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the rock pigeon yet by comparing the several sub breeds of these varieties more especially those brought from distant countries we can make an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure thirdly those characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed for instance the wattle and length of beak of the carrier the shortness of that of the tumbler and the number of tail feathers in the fantail are in each breed eminently variable and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when we come to treat of selection fourthly pigeons have been watched and tended with the utmost care and loved by many people they have been domesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the world the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth г gyptian dynasty about 3000 b c as was pointed out to me by professor lepsius but mr birch informs me that pigeons are given in a bill 28 of fare in the previous dynasty in the time of the romans as we hear from pliny immense prices were given for pigeons nay they are come to this pass that they can reckon up their pedigree and race pigeons were much valued by akber khan in india about the year 1600 never less than 20 000 pigeons were taken with the court the monarchs of iran and turan sent him some very rare birds and continues the courtly historian his majesty by crossing the breeds which method was never practised before has improved them astonishingly about this same period the dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old romans the paramount importance of these considerations in explaining the immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone will be obvious when we treat of selection we shall then also see how it is that the breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character it is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct breeds that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life and thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary i have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some yet quite insufficient length because when i first kept pigeons and watched the several kinds knowing well how true they bred i felt fully as much difficulty in believing that they could have descended from a common parent as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard to the many species of finches or other large groups of birds in nature one circumstance has struck me much namely that all the breeders of the various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants with whom i have ever conversed or whose treatises i have read are firmly convinced that the several breeds to which each has attended are descended from so many aboriginally distinct species 29 ask as i have asked a celebrated raiser of hereford cattle whether his cattle might not have descended from long horns and he will laugh you to scorn i have never met a pigeon or poultry or duck or rabbit fancier who was not fully convinced that each main breed was descended from a distinct species van mons in his treatise on pears and apples shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several sorts for instance a ribston pippin or codlin apple could ever have proceeded from the seeds of the same tree innumerable other examples could be given the explanation i think is simple from long continued study they are strongly impressed with the differences between the several races and though they well know that each race varies slightly for they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences yet they ignore all general arguments and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences accumulated during many successive generations may not those naturalists who knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of descent yet admit that many of our domestic races have descended from the same parents may they not learn a lesson of caution when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other species selection let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been produced either from one or from several allied species some little effect may perhaps be attributed to the direct action of the external conditions of life and some little to habit but he would be a bold man who would account by such agencies for the differences of a dray and race horse a greyhound and bloodhound a carrier and tumbler pigeon one of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races 30 is that we see in them adaptation not indeed to the animal s or plant s own good but to man s use or fancy some variations useful to him have probably arisen suddenly or by one step many botanists for instance believe that the fuller s teazle with its hooks which cannot be rivalled by any mechanical contrivance is only a variety of the wild dipsacus and this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling so it has probably been with the turnspit dog and this is known to have been the case with the ancon sheep but when we compare the dray horse and race horse the dromedary and camel the various breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain pasture with the wool of one breed good for one purpose and that of another breed for another purpose when we compare the many breeds of dogs each good for man in very different ways when we compare the game cock so pertinacious in battle with other breeds so little quarrelsome with everlasting layers which never desire to sit and with the bantam so small and elegant when we compare the host of agricultural culinary orchard and flower garden races of plants most useful to man at different seasons and for different purposes or so beautiful in his eyes we must i think look further than to mere variability we cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them indeed in several cases we know that this has not been their history the key is man s power of accumulative selection nature gives successive variations man adds them up in certain directions useful to him in this sense he may be said to make for himself useful breeds the great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical it is certain that several of our eminent breeders have even within a single lifetime modified to 31 a large extent some breeds of cattle and sheep in order fully to realise what they have done it is almost necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject and to inspect the animals breeders habitually speak of an animal s organisation as something quite plastic which they can model almost as they please if i had space i could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly competent authorities youatt who was probably better acquainted with the works of agriculturists than almost any other individual and who was himself a very good judge of an animal speaks of the principle of selection as that which enables the agriculturist not only to modify the character of his flock but to change it altogether it is the magician s wand by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases lord somerville speaking of what breeders have done for sheep says it would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself and then had given it existence that most skilful breeder sir john sebright used to say with respect to pigeons that he would produce any given feather in three years but it would take him six years to obtain head and beak in saxony the importance of the principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised that men follow it as a trade the sheep are placed on a table and are studied like a picture by a connoisseur this is done three times at intervals of months and the sheep are each time marked and classed so that the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding what english breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous prices given for animals with a good pedigree and these have now been exported to almost every quarter of the world the improvement is by no means generally due to crossing different breeds 32 all the best breeders are strongly opposed to this practice except sometimes amongst closely allied sub breeds and when a cross has been made the closest selection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases if selection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety and breeding from it the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the accumulation in one direction during successive generations of differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye differences which i for one have vainly attempted to appreciate not one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder if gifted with these qualities and he studies his subject for years and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance he will succeed and may make great improvements if he wants any of these qualities he will assuredly fail few would readily believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful pigeon fancier the same principles are followed by horticulturists but the variations are here often more abrupt no one supposes that our choicest productions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock we have proofs that this is not so in some cases in which exact records have been kept thus to give a very trifling instance the steadily increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted we see an astonishing improvement in many florists flowers when the flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago when a race of plants is once pretty well established the seed raisers do not pick out the best plants but merely go over their seed beds and pull up the rogues as they call the plants that deviate from the proper standard with animals this 33 kind of selection is in fact also followed for hardly any one is so careless as to allow his worst animals to breed in regard to plants there is another means of observing the accumulated effects of selection namely by comparing the diversity of flowers in the different varieties of the same species in the flower garden the diversity of leaves pods or tubers or whatever part is valued in the kitchen garden in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard in comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties see how different the leaves of the cabbage are and how extremely alike the flowers how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are and how alike the leaves how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size colour shape and hairiness and yet the flowers present very slight differences it is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one point do not differ at all in other points this is hardly ever perhaps never the case the laws of correlation of growth the importance of which should never be overlooked will ensure some differences but as a general rule i cannot doubt that the continued selection of slight variations either in the leaves the flowers or the fruit will produce races differing from each other chiefly in these characters it may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to methodical practice for scarcely more than three quarters of a century it has certainly been more attended to of late years and many treatises have been published on the subject and the result has been in a corresponding degree rapid and important but it is very far from true that the principle is a modern discovery i could give several references to the full acknowledgment of the importance of the principle in works of high antiquity in rude and barbarous periods 34 of english history choice animals were often imported and laws were passed to prevent their exportation the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered and this may be compared to the roguing of plants by nurserymen the principle of selection i find distinctly given in an ancient chinese encyclopг dia explicit rules are laid down by some of the roman classical writers from passages in genesis it is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals to improve the breed and they formerly did so as is attested by passages in pliny the savages in south africa match their draught cattle by colour as do some of the esquimaux their teams of dogs livingstone shows how much good domestic breeds are valued by the negroes of the interior of africa who have not associated with europeans some of these facts do not show actual selection but they show that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times and is now attended to by the lowest savages it would indeed have been a strange fact had attention not been paid to breeding for the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious at the present time eminent breeders try by methodical selection with a distinct object in view to make a new strain or sub breed superior to anything existing in the country but for our purpose a kind of selection which may be called unconscious and which results from every one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals is more important thus a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed nevertheless i cannot doubt that this process continued during centuries 35 would improve and modify any breed in the same way as bakewell collins c by this very same process only carried on more methodically did greatly modify even during their own lifetimes the forms and qualities of their cattle slow and insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question had been made long ago which might serve for comparison in some cases however unchanged or but little changed individuals of the same breed may be found in less civilised districts where the breed has been less improved there is reason to believe that king charles s spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent since the time of that monarch some highly competent authorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel and has probably been slowly altered from it it is known that the english pointer has been greatly changed within the last century and in this case the change has it is believed been chiefly effected by crosses with the fox hound but what concerns us is that the change has been effected unconsciously and gradually and yet so effectually that though the old spanish pointer certainly came from spain mr borrow has not seen as i am informed by him any native dog in spain like our pointer by a similar process of selection and by careful training the whole body of english racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent arab stock so that the latter by the regulations for the goodwood races are favoured in the weights they carry lord spencer and others have shown how the cattle of england have increased in weight and in early maturity compared with the stock formerly kept in this country by comparing the accounts given in old pigeon treatises of carriers and tumblers with these breeds as now existing in britain 36 india and persia we can i think clearly trace the stages through which they have insensibly passed and come to differ so greatly from the rock pigeon youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of selection which may be considered as unconsciously followed in so far that the breeders could never have expected or even have wished to have produced the result which ensued namely the production of two distinct strains the two flocks of leicester sheep kept by mr buckley and mr burgess as mr youatt remarks have been purely bred from the original stock of mr bakewell for upwards of fifty years there is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of mr bakewell s flock and yet the difference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties if there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals yet any one animal particularly useful to them for any special purpose would be carefully preserved during famines and other accidents to which savages are so liable and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection going on we see the value set on animals even by the barbarians of tierra del fuego by their killing and devouring their old women in times of dearth as of less value than their dogs in plants the same gradual process of improvement through the occasional preservation of the best individuals whether or not sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties and whether 37 or not two or more species or races have become blended together by crossing may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease rose pelargonium dahlia and other plants when compared with the older varieties or with their parent stocks no one would ever expect to get a first rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant no one would expect to raise a first rate melting pear from the seed of the wild pear though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild if it had come from a garden stock the pear though cultivated in classical times appears from pliny s description to have been a fruit of very inferior quality i have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners in having produced such splendid results from such poor materials but the art i cannot doubt has been simple and as far as the final result is concerned has been followed almost unconsciously it has consisted in always cultivating the best known variety sowing its seeds and when a slightly better variety has chanced to appear selecting it and so onwards but the gardeners of the classical period who cultivated the best pear they could procure never thought what splendid fruit we should eat though we owe our excellent fruit in some small degree to their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find a large amount of change in our cultivated plants thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated explains as i believe the well known fact that in a vast number of cases we cannot recognise and therefore do not know the wild parent stocks of the plants which have been longest cultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens if it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present 38 standard of usefulness to man we can understand how it is that neither australia the cape of good hope nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man has afforded us a single plant worth culture it is not that these countries so rich in species do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants in countries anciently civilised in regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man it should not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food at least during certain seasons and in two countries very differently circumstanced individuals of the same species having slightly different constitutions or structure would often succeed better in the one country than in the other and thus by a process of natural selection as will hereafter be more fully explained two sub breeds might be formed this perhaps partly explains what has been remarked by some authors namely that the varieties kept by savages have more of the character of species than the varieties kept in civilised countries on the view here given of the all important part which selection by man has played it becomes at once obvious how it is that our domestic races show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man s wants or fancies we can i think further understand the frequently abnormal character of our domestic races and likewise their differences being so great in external characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs man can hardly select or only with much difficulty any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal he can never act by selection excepting on variations 39 which are first given to him in some slight degree by nature no man would ever try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared the more likely it would be to catch his attention but to use such an expression as trying to make a fantail is i have no doubt in most cases utterly incorrect the man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail never dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon would become through long continued partly unconscious and partly methodical selection perhaps the parent bird of all fantails had only fourteen tail feathers somewhat expanded like the present java fantail or like individuals of other and distinct breeds in which as many as seventeen tail feathers have been counted perhaps the first pouter pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus a habit which is disregarded by all fanciers as it is not one of the points of the breed nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be necessary to catch the fancier s eye he perceives extremely small differences and it is in human nature to value any novelty however slight in one s own possession nor must the value which would formerly be set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species be judged of by the value which would now be set on them after several breeds have once fairly been established many slight differences might and indeed do now arise amongst pigeons which are rejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection of each breed the common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties hence the thoulouse and the common breed which differ only in colour that 40 most fleeting of characters have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry shows i think these views further explain what has sometimes been noticed namely that we know nothing about the origin or history of any of our domestic breeds but in fact a breed like a dialect of a language can hardly be said to have had a definite origin a man preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure or takes more care than usual in matching his best animals and thus improves them and the improved individuals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood but as yet they will hardly have a distinct name and from being only slightly valued their history will be disregarded when further improved by the same slow and gradual process they will spread more widely and will get recognised as something distinct and valuable and will then probably first receive a provincial name in semi civilised countries with little free communication the spreading and knowledge of any new sub breed will be a slow process as soon as the points of value of the new sub breed are once fully acknowledged the principle as i have called it of unconscious selection will always tend perhaps more at one period than at another as the breed rises or falls in fashion perhaps more in one district than in another according to the state of civilization of the inhabitants slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed whatever they may be but the chance will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow varying and insensible changes i must now say a few words on the circumstances favourable or the reverse to man s power of selection a high degree of variability is obviously favourable as freely giving the materials for selection to work on not that mere individual differences are not amply 41 sufficient with extreme care to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of modification in almost any desired direction but as variations manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally the chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept and hence this comes to be of the highest importance to success on this principle marshall has remarked with respect to the sheep of parts of yorkshire that as they generally belong to poor people and are mostly in small lots they never can be improved on the other hand nurserymen from raising large stocks of the same plants are generally far more successful than amateurs in getting new and valuable varieties the keeping of a large number of individuals of a species in any country requires that the species should be placed under favourable conditions of life so as to breed freely in that country when the individuals of any species are scanty all the individuals whatever their quality may be will generally be allowed to breed and this will effectually prevent selection but probably the most important point of all is that the animal or plant should be so highly useful to man or so much valued by him that the closest attention should be paid to even the slightest deviation in the qualities or structure of each individual unless such attention be paid nothing can be effected i have seen it gravely remarked that it was most fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when gardeners began to attend closely to this plant no doubt the strawberry had always varied since it was cultivated but the slight varieties had been neglected as soon however as gardeners picked out individual plants with slightly larger earlier or better fruit and raised seedlings from them and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them then there appeared aided by some 42 crossing with distinct species those many admirable varieties of the strawberry which have been raised during the last thirty or forty years in the case of animals with separate sexes facility in preventing crosses is an important element of success in the formation of new races at least in a country which is already stocked with other races in this respect enclosure of the land plays a part wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same species pigeons can be mated for life and this is a great convenience to the fancier for thus many races may be kept true though mingled in the same aviary and this circumstance must have largely favoured the improvement and formation of new breeds pigeons i may add can be propagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate and inferior birds may be freely rejected as when killed they serve for food on the other hand cats from their nocturnal rambling habits cannot be matched and although so much valued by women and children we hardly ever see a distinct breed kept up such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country often from islands although i do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat the donkey peacock goose c may be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into play in cats from the difficulty in pairing them in donkeys from only a few being kept by poor people and little attention paid to their breeding in peacocks from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept in geese from being valuable only for two purposes food and feathers and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct breeds to sum up on the origin of our domestic races of 43 animals and plants i believe that the conditions of life from their action on the reproductive system are so far of the highest importance as causing variability i do not believe that variability is an inherent and necessary contingency under all circumstances with all organic beings as some authors have thought the effects of variability are modified by various degrees of inheritance and of reversion variability is governed by many unknown laws more especially by that of correlation of growth something may be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of life something must be attributed to use and disuse the final result is thus rendered infinitely complex in some cases i do not doubt that the intercrossing of species aboriginally distinct has played an important part in the origin of our domestic productions when in any country several domestic breeds have once been established their occasional intercrossing with the aid of selection has no doubt largely aided in the formation of new sub breeds but the importance of the crossing of varieties has i believe been greatly exaggerated both in regard to animals and to those plants which are propagated by seed in plants which are temporarily propagated by cuttings buds c the importance of the crossing both of distinct species and of varieties is immense for the cultivator here quite disregards the extreme variability both of hybrids and mongrels and the frequent sterility of hybrids but the cases of plants not propagated by seed are of little importance to us for their endurance is only temporary over all these causes of change i am convinced that the accumulative action of selection whether applied methodically and more quickly or unconsciously and more slowly but more efficiently is by far the predominant power 44 chapter ii variation under nature variability individual differences doubtful species wide ranging much diffused and common species vary most species of the larger genera in any country vary more than the species of the smaller genera many of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in being very closely but unequally related to each other and in having restricted ranges before applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic beings in a state of nature we must briefly discuss whether these latter are subject to any variation to treat this subject at all properly a long catalogue of dry facts should be given but these i shall reserve for my future work nor shall i here discuss the various definitions which have been given of the term species no one definition has as yet satisfied all naturalists yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species generally the term includes the unknown element of a distinct act of creation the term variety is almost equally difficult to define but here community of descent is almost universally implied though it can rarely be proved we have also what are called monstrosities but they graduate into varieties by a monstrosity i presume is meant some considerable deviation of structure in one part either injurious to or not useful to the species and not generally propagated some authors use the term variation in a technical sense as implying a modification directly due to the physical conditions of life and variations in this sense are supposed not to be inherited but who can say that the dwarfed condition of shells in the brackish waters of the baltic or dwarfed 45 plants on alpine summits or the thicker fur of an animal from far northwards would not in some cases be inherited for at least some few generations and in this case i presume that the form would be called a variety again we have many slight differences which may be called individual differences such as are known frequently to appear in the offspring from the same parents or which may be presumed to have thus arisen from being frequently observed in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same confined locality no one supposes that all the individuals of the same species are cast in the very same mould these individual differences are highly important for us as they afford materials for natural selection to accumulate in the same manner as man can accumulate in any given direction individual differences in his domesticated productions these individual differences generally affect what naturalists consider unimportant parts but i could show by a long catalogue of facts that parts which must be called important whether viewed under a physiological or classificatory point of view sometimes vary in the individuals of the same species i am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability even in important parts of structure which he could collect on good authority as i have collected during a course of years it should be remembered that systematists are far from pleased at finding variability in important characters and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs and compare them in many specimens of the same species i should never have expected that the branching of the main nerves close to the great central ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same species i should have expected that changes of this nature could have been effected only 46 by slow degrees yet quite recently mr lubbock has shown a degree of variability in these main nerves in coccus which may almost be compared to the irregular branching of the stem of a tree this philosophical naturalist i may add has also quite recently shown that the muscles in the larvг of certain insects are very far from uniform authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that important organs never vary for these same authors practically rank that character as important as some few naturalists have honestly confessed which does not vary and under this point of view no instance of an important part varying will ever be found but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can be given there is one point connected with individual differences which seems to me extremely perplexing i refer to those genera which have sometimes been called protean or polymorphic in which the species present an inordinate amount of variation and hardly two naturalists can agree which forms to rank as species and which as varieties we may instance rubus rosa and hieracium amongst plants several genera of insects and several genera of brachiopod shells in most polymorphic genera some of the species have fixed and definite characters genera which are polymorphic in one country seem to be with some few exceptions polymorphic in other countries and likewise judging from brachiopod shells at former periods of time these facts seem to be very perplexing for they seem to show that this kind of variability is independent of the conditions of life i am inclined to suspect that we see in these polymorphic genera variations in points of structure which are of no service or disservice to the species and which consequently have not been seized on and rendered definite by natural selection as hereafter will be explained 47 those forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of species but which are so closely similar to some other forms or are so closely linked to them by intermediate gradations that naturalists do not like to rank them as distinct species are in several respects the most important for us we have every reason to believe that many of these doubtful and closely allied forms have permanently retained their characters in their own country for a long time for as long as far as we know as have good and true species practically when a naturalist can unite two forms together by others having intermediate characters he treats the one as a variety of the other ranking the most common but sometimes the one first described as the species and the other as the variety but cases of great difficulty which i will not here enumerate sometimes occur in deciding whether or not to rank one form as a variety of another even when they are closely connected by intermediate links nor will the commonly assumed hybrid nature of the intermediate links always remove the difficulty in very many cases however one form is ranked as a variety of another not because the intermediate links have actually been found but because analogy leads the observer to suppose either that they do now somewhere exist or may formerly have existed and here a wide door for the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened hence in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or a variety the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide experience seems the only guide to follow we must however in many cases decide by a majority of naturalists for few well marked and well known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as species by at least some competent judges 48 that varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be disputed compare the several floras of great britain of france or of the united states drawn up by different botanists and see what a surprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good species and by another as mere varieties mr h c watson to whom i lie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds has marked for me 182 british plants which are generally considered as varieties but which have all been ranked by botanists as species and in making this list he has omitted many trifling varieties but which nevertheless have been ranked by some botanists as species and he has entirely omitted several highly polymorphic genera under genera including the most polymorphic forms mr babington gives 251 species whereas mr bentham gives only 112 a difference of 139 doubtful forms amongst animals which unite for each birth and which are highly locomotive doubtful forms ranked by one zoologist as a species and by another as a variety can rarely be found within the same country but are common in separated areas how many of those birds and insects in north america and europe which differ very slightly from each other have been ranked by one eminent naturalist as undoubted species and by another as varieties or as they are often called as geographical races many years ago when comparing and seeing others compare the birds from the separate islands of the galapagos archipelago both one with another and with those from the american mainland i was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between species and varieties on the islets of the little madeira group there are many insects which are characterized as varieties in mr wollaston s admirable work but which it cannot 49 be doubted would be ranked as distinct species by many entomologists even ireland has a few animals now generally regarded as varieties but which have been ranked as species by some zoologists several most experienced ornithologists consider our british red grouse as only a strongly marked race of a norwegian species whereas the greater number rank it as an undoubted species peculiar to great britain a wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leads many naturalists to rank both as distinct species but what distance it has been well asked will suffice if that between america and europe is ample will that between the continent and the azores or madeira or the canaries or ireland be sufficient it must be admitted that many forms considered by highly competent judges as varieties have so perfectly the character of species that they are ranked by other highly competent judges as good and true species but to discuss whether they are rightly called species or varieties before any definition of these terms has been generally accepted is vainly to beat the air many of the cases of strongly marked varieties or doubtful species well deserve consideration for several interesting lines of argument from geographical distribution analogical variation hybridism c have been brought to bear on the attempt to determine their rank i will here give only a single instance the well known one of the primrose and cowslip or primula vulgaris and veris these plants differ considerably in appearance they have a different flavour and emit a different odour they flower at slightly different periods they grow in somewhat different stations they ascend mountains to different heights they have different geographical ranges and lastly according to very numerous experiments made during several years by 50 that most careful observer gг rtner they can be crossed only with much difficulty we could hardly wish for better evidence of the two forms being specifically distinct on the other hand they are united by many intermediate links and it is very doubtful whether these links are hybrids and there is as it seems to me an overwhelming amount of experimental evidence showing that they descend from common parents and consequently must be ranked as varieties close investigation in most cases will bring naturalists to an agreement how to rank doubtful forms yet it must be confessed that it is in the best known countries that we find the greatest number of forms of doubtful value i have been struck with the fact that if any animal or plant in a state of nature be highly useful to man or from any cause closely attract his attention varieties of it will almost universally be found recorded these varieties moreover will be often ranked by some authors as species look at the common oak how closely it has been studied yet a german author makes more than a dozen species out of forms which are very generally considered as varieties and in this country the highest botanical authorities and practical men can be quoted to show that the sessile and pedunculated oaks are either good and distinct species or mere varieties when a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organisms quite unknown to him he is at first much perplexed to determine what differences to consider as specific and what as varieties for he knows nothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the group is subject and this shows at least how very generally there is some variation but if he confine his attention to one class within one country he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtful forms his 51 general tendency will be to make many species for he will become impressed just like the pigeon or poultry fancier before alluded to with the amount of difference in the forms which he is continually studying and he has little general knowledge of analogical variation in other groups and in other countries by which to correct his first impressions as he extends the range of his observations he will meet with more cases of difficulty for he will encounter a greater number of closely allied forms but if his observations be widely extended he will in the end generally be enabled to make up his own mind which to call varieties and which species but he will succeed in this at the expense of admitting much variation and the truth of this admission will often be disputed by other naturalists when moreover he comes to study allied forms brought from countries not now continuous in which case he can hardly hope to find the intermediate links between his doubtful forms he will have to trust almost entirely to analogy and his difficulties rise to a climax certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn between species and sub species that is the forms which in the opinion of some naturalists come very near to but do not quite arrive at the rank of species or again between sub species and well marked varieties or between lesser varieties and individual differences these differences blend into each other in an insensible series and a series impresses the mind with the idea of an actual passage hence i look at individual differences though of small interest to the systematist as of high importance for us as being the first step towards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recording in works on natural history and i look at varieties which are in any degree more distinct and permanent as steps leading to more 52 strongly marked and more permanent varieties and at these latter as leading to sub species and to species the passage from one stage of difference to another and higher stage may be in some cases due merely to the long continued action of different physical conditions in two different regions but i have not much faith in this view and i attribute the passage of a variety from a state in which it differs very slightly from its parent to one in which it differs more to the action of natural selection in accumulating as will hereafter be more fully explained differences of structure in certain definite directions hence i believe a well marked variety may be called an incipient species but whether this belief be justifiable must be judged of by the general weight of the several facts and views given throughout this work it need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient species necessarily attain the rank of species they may whilst in this incipient state become extinct or they may endure as varieties for very long periods as has been shown to be the case by mr wollaston with the varieties of certain fossil land shells in madeira if a variety were to flourish so as to exceed in numbers the parent species it would then rank as the species and the species as the variety or it might come to supplant and exterminate the parent species or both might co exist and both rank as independent species but we shall hereafter have to return to this subject from these remarks it will be seen that i look at the term species as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set of individuals closely resembling each other and that it does not essentially differ from the term variety which is given to less distinct and more fluctuating forms the term variety again in comparison with mere individual differences is also applied arbitrarily and for mere convenience sake 53 guided by theoretical considerations i thought that some interesting results might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of the species which vary most by tabulating all the varieties in several well worked floras at first this seemed a simple task but mr h c watson to whom i am much indebted for valuable advice and assistance on this subject soon convinced me that there were many difficulties as did subsequently dr hooker even in stronger terms i shall reserve for my future work the discussion of these difficulties and the tables themselves of the proportional numbers of the varying species dr hooker permits me to add that after having carefully read my manuscript and examined the tables he thinks that the following statements are fairly well established the whole subject however treated as it necessarily here is with much brevity is rather perplexing and allusions cannot be avoided to the struggle for existence divergence of character and other questions hereafter to be discussed alph de candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wide ranges generally present varieties and this might have been expected as they become exposed to diverse physical conditions and as they come into competition which as we shall hereafter see is a far more important circumstance with different sets of organic beings but my tables further show that in any limited country the species which are most common that is abound most in individuals and the species which are most widely diffused within their own country and this is a different consideration from wide range and to a certain extent from commonness often give rise to varieties sufficiently well marked to have been recorded in botanical works hence it is the most flourishing or as they may be called the dominant species those 54 which range widely over the world are the most diffused in their own country and are the most numerous in individuals which oftenest produce well marked varieties or as i consider them incipient species and this perhaps might have been anticipated for as varieties in order to become in any degree permanent necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of the country the species which are already dominant will be the most likely to yield offspring which though in some slight degree modified still inherit those advantages that enabled their parents to become dominant over their compatriots if the plants inhabiting a country and described in any flora be divided into two equal masses all those in the larger genera being placed on one side and all those in the smaller genera on the other side a somewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused or dominant species will be found on the side of the larger genera this again might have been anticipated for the mere fact of many species of the same genus inhabiting any country shows that there is something in the organic or inorganic conditions of that country favourable to the genus and consequently we might have expected to have found in the larger genera or those including many species a large proportional number of dominant species but so many causes tend to obscure this result that i am surprised that my tables show even a small majority on the side of the larger genera i will here allude to only two causes of obscurity fresh water and salt loving plants have generally very wide ranges and are much diffused but this seems to be connected with the nature of the stations inhabited by them and has little or no relation to the size of the genera to which the species belong again plants low in the scale of organisation are 55 generally much more widely diffused than plants higher in the scale and here again there is no close relation to the size of the genera the cause of lowly organised plants ranging widely will be discussed in our chapter on geographical distribution from looking at species as only strongly marked and well defined varieties i was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera in each country would oftener present varieties than the species of the smaller genera for wherever many closely related species i e species of the same genus have been formed many varieties or incipient species ought as a general rule to be now forming where many large trees grow we expect to find saplings where many species of a genus have been formed through variation circumstances have been favourable for variation and hence we might expect that the circumstances would generally be still favourable to variation on the other hand if we look at each species as a special act of creation there is no apparent reason why more varieties should occur in a group having many species than in one having few to test the truth of this anticipation i have arranged the plants of twelve countries and the coleopterous insects of two districts into two nearly equal masses the species of the larger genera on one side and those of the smaller genera on the other side and it has invariably proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on the side of the larger genera present varieties than on the side of the smaller genera moreover the species of the large genera which present any varieties invariably present a larger average number of varieties than do the species of the small genera both these results follow when another division is made and when all the smallest genera with from only one to four species are absolutely excluded from the tables these 56 facts are of plain signification on the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties for wherever many species of the same genus have been formed or where if we may use the expression the manufactory of species has been active we ought generally to find the manufactory still in action more especially as we have every reason to believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one and this certainly is the case if varieties be looked at as incipient species for my tables clearly show as a general rule that wherever many species of a genus have been formed the species of that genus present a number of varieties that is of incipient species beyond the average it is not that all large genera are now varying much and are thus increasing in the number of their species or that no small genera are now varying and increasing for if this had been so it would have been fatal to my theory inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that small genera have in the lapse of time often increased greatly in size and that large genera have often come to their maxima declined and disappeared all that we want to show is that where many species of a genus have been formed on an average many are still forming and this holds good there are other relations between the species of large genera and their recorded varieties which deserve notice we have seen that there is no infallible criterion by which to distinguish species and well marked varieties and in those cases in which intermediate links have not been found between doubtful forms naturalists are compelled to come to a determination by the amount of difference between them judging by analogy whether or not the amount suffices to raise one or both to the rank of species hence the amount of difference is one very important criterion in settling whether two forms 57 should be ranked as species or varieties now fries has remarked in regard to plants and westwood in regard to insects that in large genera the amount of difference between the species is often exceedingly small i have endeavoured to test this numerically by averages and as far as my imperfect results go they confirm the view i have also consulted some sagacious and experienced observers and after deliberation they concur in this view in this respect therefore the species of the larger genera resemble varieties more than do the species of the smaller genera or the case may be put in another way and it may be said that in the larger genera in which a number of varieties or incipient species greater than the average are now manufacturing many of the species already manufactured still to a certain extent resemble varieties for they differ from each other by a less than usual amount of difference moreover the species of the large genera are related to each other in the same manner as the varieties of any one species are related to each other no naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus are equally distinct from each other they may generally be divided into sub genera or sections or lesser groups as fries has well remarked little groups of species are generally clustered like satellites around certain other species and what are varieties but groups of forms unequally related to each other and clustered round certain forms that is round their parent species undoubtedly there is one most important point of difference between varieties and species namely that the amount of difference between varieties when compared with each other or with their parent species is much less than that between the species of the same genus but when we come to discuss the principle as i call it of divergence of character 58 we shall see how this may be explained and how the lesser differences between varieties will tend to increase into the greater differences between species there is one other point which seems to me worth notice varieties generally have much restricted ranges this statement is indeed scarcely more than a truism for if a variety were found to have a wider range than that of its supposed parent species their denominations ought to be reversed but there is also reason to believe that those species which are very closely allied to other species and in so far resemble varieties often have much restricted ranges for instance mr h c watson has marked for me in the well sifted london catalogue of plants 4th edition 63 plants which are therein ranked as species but which he considers as so closely allied to other species as to be of doubtful value these 63 reputed species range on an average over 6 9 of the provinces into which mr watson has divided great britain now in this same catalogue 53 acknowledged varieties are recorded and these range over 7 7 provinces whereas the species to which these varieties belong range over 14 3 provinces so that the acknowledged varieties have very nearly the same restricted average range as have those very closely allied forms marked for me by mr watson as doubtful species but which are almost universally ranked by british botanists as good and true species finally then varieties have the same general characters as species for they cannot be distinguished from species except firstly by the discovery of intermediate linking forms and the occurrence of such links cannot affect the actual characters of the forms which they connect and except secondly by a certain amount of 59 difference for two forms if differing very little are generally ranked as varieties notwithstanding that intermediate linking forms have not been discovered but the amount of difference considered necessary to give to two forms the rank of species is quite indefinite in genera having more than the average number of species in any country the species of these genera have more than the average number of varieties in large genera the species are apt to be closely but unequally allied together forming little clusters round certain species species very closely allied to other species apparently have restricted ranges in all these several respects the species of large genera present a strong analogy with varieties and we can clearly understand these analogies if species have once existed as varieties and have thus originated whereas these analogies are utterly inexplicable if each species has been independently created we have also seen that it is the most flourishing or dominant species of the larger genera which on an average vary most and varieties as we shall hereafter see tend to become converted into new and distinct species the larger genera thus tend to become larger and throughout nature the forms of life which are now dominant tend to become still more dominant by leaving many modified and dominant descendants but by steps hereafter to be explained the larger genera also tend to break up into smaller genera and thus the forms of life throughout the universe become divided into groups subordinate to groups 60 chapter iii struggle for existence bears on natural selection the term used in a wide sense geometrical powers of increase rapid increase of naturalised animals and plants nature of the checks to increase competition universal effects of climate protection from the number of individuals complex relations of all animals and plants throughout nature struggle for life most severe between individuals and varieties of the same species often severe between species of the same genus the relation of organism to organism the most important of all relations before entering on the subject of this chapter i must make a few preliminary remarks to show how the struggle for existence bears on natural selection it has been seen in the last chapter that amongst organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variability indeed i am not aware that this has ever been disputed it is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called species or sub species or varieties what rank for instance the two or three hundred doubtful forms of british plants are entitled to hold if the existence of any well marked varieties be admitted but the mere existence of individual variability and of some few well marked varieties though necessary as the foundation for the work helps us but little in understanding how species arise in nature how have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part and to the conditions of life and of one distinct organic being to another being been perfected we see these beautiful co adaptations most 61 plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze in short we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world again it may be asked how is it that varieties which i have called incipient species become ultimately converted into good and distinct species which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more than do the varieties of the same species how do those groups of species which constitute what are called distinct genera and which differ from each other more than do the species of the same genus arise all these results as we shall more fully see in the next chapter follow from the struggle for life owing to this struggle for life any variation however slight and from whatever cause proceeding if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of any species in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to external nature will tend to the preservation of that individual and will generally be inherited by its offspring the offspring also will thus have a better chance of surviving for of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born but a small number can survive i have called this principle by which each slight variation if useful is preserved by the term of natural selection in order to mark its relation to man s power of selection we have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results and can adapt organic beings to his own uses through the accumulation of slight but useful variations given to him by the hand of nature but natural selection as we shall hereafter see is a power incessantly ready for action and is as 62 immeasurably superior to man s feeble efforts as the works of nature are to those of art we will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence in my future work this subject shall be treated as it well deserves at much greater length the elder de candolle and lyell have largely and philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severe competition in regard to plants no one has treated this subject with more spirit and ability than w herbert dean of manchester evidently the result of his great horticultural knowledge nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life or more difficult at least i have found it so than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind i am convinced that the whole economy of nature with every fact on distribution rarity abundance extinction and variation will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood we behold the face of nature bright with gladness we often see superabundance of food we do not see or we forget that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live on insects or seeds and are thus constantly destroying life or we forget how largely these songsters or their eggs or their nestlings are destroyed by birds and beasts of prey we do not always bear in mind that though food may be now superabundant it is not so at all seasons of each recurring year i should premise that i use the term struggle for existence in a large and metaphorical sense including dependence of one being on another and including which is more important not only the life of the individual but success in leaving progeny two canine animals in a time of dearth may be truly said to struggle with each other which shall get food and live but a plant on the edge of a desert is said to struggle 63 for life against the drought though more properly it should be said to be dependent on the moisture a plant which annually produces a thousand seeds of which on an average only one comes to maturity may be more truly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds which already clothe the ground the missletoe is dependent on the apple and a few other trees but can only in a far fetched sense be said to struggle with these trees for if too many of these parasites grow on the same tree it will languish and die but several seedling missletoes growing close together on the same branch may more truly be said to struggle with each other as the missletoe is disseminated by birds its existence depends on birds and it may metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruit bearing plants in order to tempt birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than those of other plants in these several senses which pass into each other i use for convenience sake the general term of struggle for existence a struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which all organic beings tend to increase every being which during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds must suffer destruction during some period of its life and during some season or occasional year otherwise on the principle of geometrical increase its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the product hence as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive there must in every case be a struggle for existence either one individual with another of the same species or with the individuals of distinct species or with the physical conditions of life it is the doctrine of malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms for in this case there 64 can be no artificial increase of food and no prudential restraint from marriage although some species may be now increasing more or less rapidly in numbers all cannot do so for the world would not hold them there is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturally increases at so high a rate that if not destroyed the earth would soon be covered by the progeny of a single pair even slow breeding man has doubled in twenty five years and at this rate in a few thousand years there would literally not be standing room for his progeny linnг us has calculated that if an annual plant produced only two seeds and there is no plant so unproductive as this and their seedlings next year produced two and so on then in twenty years there would be a million plants the elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder of all known animals and i have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase it will be under the mark to assume that it breeds when thirty years old and goes on breeding till ninety years old bringing forth three pair of young in this interval if this be so at the end of the fifth century there would be alive fifteen million elephants descended from the first pair but we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical calculations namely the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature when circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following seasons still more striking is the evidence from our domestic animals of many kinds which have run wild in several parts of the world if the statements of the rate of increase of slow breeding cattle and horses in south america and latterly in australia had not been well authenticated they would have been incredible so it is with plants cases could be given of 65 introduced plants which have become common throughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years several of the plants such as the cardoon and a tall thistle now most numerous over the wide plains of la plata clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of all other plants have been introduced from europe and there are plants which now range in india as i hear from dr falconer from cape comorin to the himalaya which have been imported from america since its discovery in such cases and endless instances could be given no one supposes that the fertility of these animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily increased in any sensible degree the obvious explanation is that the conditions of life have been very favourable and that there has consequently been less destruction of the old and young and that nearly all the young have been enabled to breed in such cases the geometrical ratio of increase the result of which never fails to be surprising simply explains the extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion of naturalised productions in their new homes in a state of nature almost every plant produces seed and amongst animals there are very few which do not annually pair hence we may confidently assert that all plants and animals are tending to increase at a geometrical ratio that all would most rapidly stock every station in which they could any how exist and that the geometrical tendency to increase must be checked by destruction at some period of life our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends i think to mislead us we see no great destruction falling on them and we forget that thousands are annually slaughtered for food and that in a state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be disposed of the only difference between organisms which annually 66 produce eggs or seeds by the thousand and those which produce extremely few is that the slow breeders would require a few more years to people under favourable conditions a whole district let it be ever so large the condor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score and yet in the same country the condor may be the more numerous of the two the fulmar petrel lays but one egg yet it is believed to be the most numerous bird in the world one fly deposits hundreds of eggs and another like the hippobosca a single one but this difference does not determine how many individuals of the two species can be supported in a district a large number of eggs is of some importance to those species which depend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of food for it allows them rapidly to increase in number but the real importance of a large number of eggs or seeds is to make up for much destruction at some period of life and this period in the great majority of cases is an early one if an animal can in any way protect its own eggs or young a small number may be produced and yet the average stock be fully kept up but if many eggs or young are destroyed many must be produced or the species will become extinct it would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree which lived on an average for a thousand years if a single seed were produced once in a thousand years supposing that this seed were never destroyed and could be ensured to germinate in a fitting place so that in all cases the average number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds in looking at nature it is most necessary to keep the foregoing considerations always in mind never to forget that every single organic being around us may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers that each lives by a struggle at some period of 67 its life that heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old during each generation or at recurrent intervals lighten any check mitigate the destruction ever so little and the number of the species will almost instantaneously increase to any amount the causes which check the natural tendency of each species to increase in number are most obscure look at the most vigorous species by as much as it swarms in numbers by so much will its tendency to increase be still further increased we know not exactly what the checks are in even one single instance nor will this surprise any one who reflects how ignorant we are on this head even in regard to mankind so incomparably better known than any other animal this subject has been ably treated by several authors and i shall in my future work discuss some of the checks at considerable length more especially in regard to the feral animals of south america here i will make only a few remarks just to recall to the reader s mind some of the chief points eggs or very young animals seem generally to suffer most but this is not invariably the case with plants there is a vast destruction of seeds but from some observations which i have made i believe that it is the seedlings which suffer most from germinating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants seedlings also are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies for instance on a piece of ground three feet long and two wide dug and cleared and where there could be no choking from other plants i marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up and out of the 357 no less than 295 were destroyed chiefly by slugs and insects if turf which has long been mown and the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds be let to grow the more vigorous plants 68 gradually kill the less vigorous though fully grown plants thus out of twenty species growing on a little plot of turf three feet by four nine species perished from the other species being allowed to grow up freely the amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme limit to which each can increase but very frequently it is not the obtaining food but the serving as prey to other animals which determines the average numbers of a species thus there seems to be little doubt that the stock of partridges grouse and hares on any large estate depends chiefly on the destruction of vermin if not one head of game were shot during the next twenty years in england and at the same time if no vermin were destroyed there would in all probability be less game than at present although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now annually killed on the other hand in some cases as with the elephant and rhinoceros none are destroyed by beasts of prey even the tiger in india most rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of a species and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought i believe to be the most effective of all checks i estimated that the winter of 1854 55 destroyed four fifths of the birds in my own grounds and this is a tremendous destruction when we remember that ten per cent is an extraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man the action of climate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for existence but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food it brings on the most severe struggle between the individuals whether of the same or of distinct species which subsist on the same kind of food even when climate for instance extreme cold 69 acts directly it will be the least vigorous or those which have got least food through the advancing winter which will suffer most when we travel from south to north or from a damp region to a dry we invariably see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer and finally disappearing and the change of climate being conspicuous we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action but this is a false view we forget that each species even where it most abounds is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life from enemies or from competitors for the same place and food and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of climate they will increase in numbers and as each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants the other species will decrease when we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers we may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being favoured as in this one being hurt so it is when we travel northward but in a somewhat lesser degree for the number of species of all kinds and therefore of competitors decreases northwards hence in going northward or in ascending a mountain we far oftener meet with stunted forms due to the directly injurious action of climate than we do in proceeding southwards or in descending a mountain when we reach the arctic regions or snow capped summits or absolute deserts the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements that climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species we may clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our gardens which can perfectly well endure our climate but which never become naturalised for they cannot compete with our native plants nor resist destruction by our native animals 70 when a species owing to highly favourable circumstances increases inordinately in numbers in a small tract epidemics at least this seems generally to occur with our game animals often ensue and here we have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life but even some of these so called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms which have from some cause possibly in part through facility of diffusion amongst the crowded animals been disproportionably favoured and here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey on the other hand in many cases a large stock of individuals of the same species relatively to the numbers of its enemies is absolutely necessary for its preservation thus we can easily raise plenty of corn and rape seed c in our fields because the seeds are in great excess compared with the number of birds which feed on them nor can the birds though having a superabundance of food at this one season increase in number proportionally to the supply of seed as their numbers are checked during winter but any one who has tried knows how troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants in a garden i have in this case lost every single seed this view of the necessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation explains i believe some singular facts in nature such as that of very rare plants being sometimes extremely abundant in the few spots where they do occur and that of some social plants being social that is abounding in individuals even on the extreme confines of their range for in such cases we may believe that a plant could exist only where the conditions of its life were so favourable that many could exist together and thus save the species from utter destruction i should add that the good effects of frequent intercrossing and 71 the ill effects of close interbreeding probably come into play in some of these cases but on this intricate subject i will not here enlarge many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the checks and relations between organic beings which have to struggle together in the same country i will give only a single instance which though a simple one has interested me in staffordshire on the estate of a relation where i had ample means of investigation there was a large and extremely barren heath which had never been touched by the hand of man but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been enclosed twenty five years previously and planted with scotch fir the change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath was most remarkable more than is generally seen in passing from one quite different soil to another not only the proportional numbers of the heath plants were wholly changed but twelve species of plants not counting grasses and carices flourished in the plantations which could not be found on the heath the effect on the insects must have been still greater for six insectivorous birds were very common in the plantations which were not to be seen on the heath and the heath was frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds here we see how potent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree nothing whatever else having been done with the exception that the land had been enclosed so that cattle could not enter but how important an element enclosure is i plainly saw near farnham in surrey here there are extensive heaths with a few clumps of old scotch firs on the distant hill tops within the last ten years large spaces have been enclosed and self sown firs are now springing up in multitudes so close together that all cannot live 72 when i ascertained that these young trees had not been sown or planted i was so much surprised at their numbers that i went to several points of view whence i could examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath and literally i could not see a single scotch fir except the old planted clumps but on looking closely between the stems of the heath i found a multitude of seedlings and little trees which had been perpetually browsed down by the cattle in one square yard at a point some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps i counted thirty two little trees and one of them with twenty six rings of growth had during many years tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath and had failed no wonder that as soon as the land was enclosed it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing young firs yet the heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that no one would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely and effectually searched it for food here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the scotch fir but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence of cattle perhaps paraguay offers the most curious instance of this for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild though they swarm southward and northward in a feral state and azara and rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in paraguay of a certain fly which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born the increase of these flies numerous as they are must be habitually checked by some means probably by birds hence if certain insectivorous birds whose numbers are probably regulated by hawks or beasts of prey were to increase in paraguay the flies would decrease then cattle and horses would became feral and this would certainly greatly 73 alter as indeed i have observed in parts of south america the vegetation this again would largely affect the insects and this as we just have seen in staffordshire the insectivorous birds and so onwards in ever increasing circles of complexity we began this series by insectivorous birds and we have ended with them not that in nature the relations can ever be as simple as this battle within battle must ever be recurring with varying success and yet in the long run the forces are so nicely balanced that the face of nature remains uniform for long periods of time though assuredly the merest trifle would often give the victory to one organic being over another nevertheless so profound is our ignorance and so high our presumption that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an organic being and as we do not see the cause we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world or invent laws on the duration of the forms of life i am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals most remote in the scale of nature are bound together by a web of complex relations i shall hereafter have occasion to show that the exotic lobelia fulgens in this part of england is never visited by insects and consequently from its peculiar structure never can set a seed many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollen masses and thus to fertilise them i have also reason to believe that humble bees are indispensable to the fertilisation of the heartsease viola tricolor for other bees do not visit this flower from experiments which i have lately tried i have found that the visits of bees are necessary for the fertilisation of some kinds of clover but humble bees alone visit the red clover trifolium pratense as other bees cannot reach the nectar hence i have very little doubt that if the 74 whole genus of humble bees became extinct or very rare in england the heartsease and red clover would become very rare or wholly disappear the number of humble bees in any district depends in a great degree on the number of field mice which destroy their combs and nests and mr h newman who has long attended to the habits of humble bees believes that more than two thirds of them are thus destroyed all over england now the number of mice is largely dependent as every one knows on the number of cats and mr newman says near villages and small towns i have found the nests of humble bees more numerous than elsewhere which i attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine through the intervention first of mice and then of bees the frequency of certain flowers in that district in the case of every species many different checks acting at different periods of life and during different seasons or years probably come into play some one check or some few being generally the most potent but all concur in determining the average number or even the existence of the species in some cases it can be shown that widely different checks act on the same species in different districts when we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank we are tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what we call chance but how false a view is this every one has heard that when an american forest is cut down a very different vegetation springs up but it has been observed that ancient indian ruins in the southern united states which must formerly have been cleared of trees now display the same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the surrounding 75 virgin forests what a struggle between the several kinds of trees must here have gone on during long centuries each annually scattering its seeds by the thousand what war between insect and insect between insects snails and other animals with birds and beasts of prey all striving to increase and all feeding on each other or on the trees or their seeds and seedlings or on the other plants which first clothed the ground and thus checked the growth of the trees throw up a handful of feathers and all must fall to the ground according to definite laws but how simple is this problem compared to the action and reaction of the innumerable plants and animals which have determined in the course of centuries the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing on the old indian ruins the dependency of one organic being on another as of a parasite on its prey lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature this is often the case with those which may strictly be said to struggle with each other for existence as in the case of locusts and grass feeding quadrupeds but the struggle almost invariably will be most severe between the individuals of the same species for they frequent the same districts require the same food and are exposed to the same dangers in the case of varieties of the same species the struggle will generally be almost equally severe and we sometimes see the contest soon decided for instance if several varieties of wheat be sown together and the mixed seed be resown some of the varieties which best suit the soil or climate or are naturally the most fertile will beat the others and so yield more seed and will consequently in a few years quite supplant the other varieties to keep up a mixed stock of even such extremely close varieties as the variously 76 coloured sweet peas they must be each year harvested separately and the seed then mixed in due proportion otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease in numbers and disappear so again with the varieties of sheep it has been asserted that certain mountain varieties will starve out other mountain varieties so that they cannot be kept together the same result has followed from keeping together different varieties of the medicinal leech it may even be doubted whether the varieties of any one of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength habits and constitution that the original proportions of a mixed stock could be kept up for half a dozen generations if they were allowed to struggle together like beings in a state of nature and if the seed or young were not annually sorted as species of the same genus have usually though by no means invariably some similarity in habits and constitution and always in structure the struggle will generally be more severe between species of the same genus when they come into competition with each other than between species of distinct genera we see this in the recent extension over parts of the united states of one species of swallow having caused the decrease of another species the recent increase of the missel thrush in parts of scotland has caused the decrease of the song thrush how frequently we hear of one species of rat taking the place of another species under the most different climates in russia the small asiatic cockroach has everywhere driven before it its great congener one species of charlock will supplant another and so in other cases we can dimly see why the competition should be most severe between allied forms which fill nearly the same place in the economy of nature 77 but probably in no one case could we precisely say why one species has been victorious over another in the great battle of life a corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoing remarks namely that the structure of every organic being is related in the most essential yet often hidden manner to that of all other organic beings with which it comes into competition for food or residence or from which it has to escape or on which it preys this is obvious in the structure of the teeth and talons of the tiger and in that of the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to the hair on the tiger s body but in the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion and in the flattened and fringed legs of the water beetle the relation seems at first confined to the elements of air and water yet the advantage of plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest relation to the land being already thickly clothed by other plants so that the seeds may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied ground in the water beetle the structure of its legs so well adapted for diving allows it to compete with other aquatic insects to hunt for its own prey and to escape serving as prey to other animals the store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems at first sight to have no sort of relation to other plants but from the strong growth of young plants produced from such seeds as peas and beans when sown in the midst of long grass i suspect that the chief use of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the young seedling whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously all around look at a plant in the midst of its range why does it not double or quadruple its numbers we know 78 that it can perfectly well withstand a little more heat or cold dampness or dryness for elsewhere it ranges into slightly hotter or colder damper or drier districts in this case we can clearly see that if we wished in imagination to give the plant the power of increasing in number we should have to give it some advantage over its competitors or over the animals which preyed on it on the confines of its geographical range a change of constitution with respect to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant but we have reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so far that they are destroyed by the rigour of the climate alone not until we reach the extreme confines of life in the arctic regions or on the borders of an utter desert will competition cease the land may be extremely cold or dry yet there will be competition between some few species or between the individuals of the same species for the warmest or dampest spots hence also we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a new country amongst new competitors though the climate may be exactly the same as in its former home yet the conditions of its life will generally be changed in an essential manner if we wished to increase its average numbers in its new home we should have to modify it in a different way to what we should have done in its native country for we should have to give it some advantage over a different set of competitors or enemies it is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form some advantage over another probably in no single instance should we know what to do so as to succeed it will convince us of our ignorance on the mutual relations of all organic beings a conviction as necessary as it seems to be difficult to acquire all that we can do is to keep steadily in mind that each 79 organic being is striving to increase at a geometrical ratio that each at some period of its life during some season of the year during each generation or at intervals has to struggle for life and to suffer great destruction when we reflect on this struggle we may console ourselves with the full belief that the war of nature is not incessant that no fear is felt that death is generally prompt and that the vigorous the healthy and the happy survive and multiply 80 chapter iv natural

by natural selection divergence of character related to the diversity of inhabitants of any small area and to naturalisation action of natural selection through divergence of character and extinction on the descendants from a common parent explains the grouping of all organic beings how will the struggle for existence discussed too briefly in the last chapter act in regard to variation can the principle of selection which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man apply in nature i think we shall see that it can act most effectually let it be borne in mind in what an endless number of strange peculiarities our domestic productions and in a lesser degree those under nature vary and how strong the hereditary tendency is under domestication it may be truly said that the whole organisation becomes in some degree plastic let it be borne in mind how infinitely complex and close fitting are the mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life can it then be thought improbable seeing that variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred that other variations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life should sometimes occur in the course of thousands of generations if such do occur can we doubt 81 remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive that individuals having any advantage however slight over others would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind on the other hand we may feel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would be rigidly destroyed this preservation of favourable variations and the rejection of injurious variations i call natural selection variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection and would be left a fluctuating element as perhaps we see in the species called polymorphic we shall best understand the probable course of natural selection by taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change for instance of climate the proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change and some species might become extinct we may conclude from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together that any change in the numerical proportions of some of the inhabitants independently of the change of climate itself would seriously affect many of the others if the country were open on its borders new forms would certainly immigrate and this also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants let it be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal has been shown to be but in the case of an island or of a country partly surrounded by barriers into which new and better adapted forms could not freely enter we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified for had the area been open to immigration these same 82 places would have been seized on by intruders in such case every slight modification which in the course of ages chanced to arise and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species by better adapting them to their altered conditions would tend to be preserved and natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement we have reason to believe as stated in the first chapter that a change in the conditions of life by specially acting on the reproductive system causes or increases variability and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a change and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection by giving a better chance of profitable variations occurring and unless profitable variations do occur natural selection can do nothing not that as i believe any extreme amount of variability is necessary as man can certainly produce great results by adding up in any given direction mere individual differences so could nature but far more easily from having incomparably longer time at her disposal nor do i believe that any great physical change as of climate or any unusual degree of isolation to check immigration is actually necessary to produce new and unoccupied places for natural selection to fill up by modifying and improving some of the varying inhabitants for as all the inhabitants of each country are struggling together with nicely balanced forces extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits of one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others and still further modifications of the same kind would often still further increase the advantage no country can be named in which all the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions under which they live that none of 83 them could anyhow be improved for in all countries the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised productions that they have allowed foreigners to take firm possession of the land and as foreigners have thus everywhere beaten some of the natives we may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified with advantage so as to have better resisted such intruders as man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his methodical and unconscious means of selection what may not nature effect man can act only on external and visible characters nature cares nothing for appearances except in so far as they may be useful to any being she can act on every internal organ on every shade of constitutional difference on the whole machinery of life man selects only for his own good nature only for that of the being which she tends every selected character is fully exercised by her and the being is placed under well suited conditions of life man keeps the natives of many climates in the same country he seldom exercises each selected character in some peculiar and fitting manner he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on the same food he does not exercise a long backed or long legged quadruped in any peculiar manner he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the same climate he does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the females he does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals but protects during each varying season as far as lies in his power all his productions he often begins his selection by some half monstrous form or at least by some modification prominent enough to catch his eye or to be plainly useful to him under nature the slightest difference of structure or constitution may well turn the nicely balanced scale in the struggle for life and so be 84 preserved how fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man how short his time and consequently how poor will his products be compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods can we wonder then that nature s productions should be far truer in character than man s productions that they should be infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship it may metaphorically be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising throughout the world every variation even the slightest rejecting that which is bad preserving and adding up all that is good silently and insensibly working whenever and wherever opportunity offers at the improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life we see nothing of these slow changes in progress until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages and then so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages that we only see that the forms of life are now different from what they formerly were although natural selection can act only through and for the good of each being yet characters and structures which we are apt to consider as of very trifling importance may thus be acted on when we see leaf eating insects green and bark feeders mottled grey the alpine ptarmigan white in winter the red grouse the colour of heather and the black grouse that of peaty earth we must believe that these tints are of service to these birds and insects in preserving them from danger grouse if not destroyed at some period of their lives would increase in countless numbers they are known to suffer largely from birds of prey and hawks are guided by eyesight to their prey so much so that on 85 parts of the continent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons as being the most liable to destruction hence i can see no reason to doubt that natural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colour to each kind of grouse and in keeping that colour when once acquired true and constant nor ought we to think that the occasional destruction of an animal of any particular colour would produce little effect we should remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroy every lamb with the faintest trace of black in plants the down on the fruit and the colour of the flesh are considered by botanists as characters of the most trifling importance yet we hear from an excellent horticulturist downing that in the united states smooth skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle a curculio than those with down that purple plums suffer far more from a certain disease than yellow plums whereas another disease attacks yellow fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh if with all the aids of art these slight differences make a great difference in cultivating the several varieties assuredly in a state of nature where the trees would have to struggle with other trees and with a host of enemies such differences would effectually settle which variety whether a smooth or downy a yellow or purple fleshed fruit should succeed in looking at many small points of difference between species which as far as our ignorance permits us to judge seem quite unimportant we must not forget that climate food c probably produce some slight and direct effect it is however far more necessary to bear in mind that there are many unknown laws of correlation of growth which when one part of the organisation is modified through variation and the modifications are accumulated by natural selection for 86 the good of the being will cause other modifications often of the most unexpected nature as we see that those variations which under domestication appear at any particular period of life tend to reappear in the offspring at the same period for instance in the seeds of the many varieties of our culinary and agricultural plants in the caterpillar and cocoon stages of the varieties of the silkworm in the eggs of poultry and in the colour of the down of their chickens in the horns of our sheep and cattle when nearly adult so in a state of nature natural selection will be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at any age by the accumulation of variations profitable at that age and by their inheritance at a corresponding age if it profit a plant to have its seeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind i can see no greater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection than in the cotton planter increasing and improving by selection the down in the pods on his cotton trees natural selection may modify and adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies wholly different from those which concern the mature insect these modifications will no doubt affect through the laws of correlation the structure of the adult and probably in the case of those insects which live only for a few hours and which never feed a large part of their structure is merely the correlated result of successive changes in the structure of their larvг so conversely modifications in the adult will probably often affect the structure of the larva but in all cases natural selection will ensure that modifications consequent on other modifications at a different period of life shall not be in the least degree injurious for if they became so they would cause the extinction of the species natural selection will modify the structure of the 87 young in relation to the parent and of the parent in relation to the young in social animals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefit of the community if each in consequence profits by the selected change what natural selection cannot do is to modify the structure of one species without giving it any advantage for the good of another species and though statements to this effect may be found in works of natural history i cannot find one case which will bear investigation a structure used only once in an animal s whole life if of high importance to it might be modified to any extent by natural selection for instance the great jaws possessed by certain insects used exclusively for opening the cocoon or the hard tip to the beak of nestling birds used for breaking the egg it has been asserted that of the best short beaked tumbler pigeons more perish in the egg than are able to get out of it so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching now if nature had to make the beak of a full grown pigeon very short for the bird s own advantage the process of modification would be very slow and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection of the young birds within the egg which had the most powerful and hardest beaks for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish or more delicate and more easily broken shells might be selected the thickness of the shell being known to vary like every other structure sexual selection inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sex and become hereditarily attached to that sex the same fact probably occurs under nature and if so natural selection will be able to modify one sex in its functional relations to the other sex or in relation to wholly different habits of life in the two sexes as is sometimes the case 88 with insects and this leads me to say a few words on what i call sexual selection this depends not on a struggle for existence but on a struggle between the males for possession of the females the result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor but few or no offspring sexual selection is therefore less rigorous than natural selection generally the most vigorous males those which are best fitted for their places in nature will leave most progeny but in many cases victory depends not on general vigour but on having special weapons confined to the male sex a hornless stag or spurless cock would have a poor chance of leaving offspring sexual selection by always allowing the victor to breed might surely give indomitable courage length to the spur and strength to the wing to strike in the spurred leg as well as the brutal cock fighter who knows well that he can improve his breed by careful selection of the best cocks how low in the scale of nature the law of battle descends i know not male alligators have been described as fighting bellowing and whirling round like indians in a war dance for the possession of the females male salmons have been seen fighting all day long male stag beetles often bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males the war is perhaps severest between the males of polygamous animals and these seem oftenest provided with special weapons the males of carnivorous animals are already well armed though to them and to others special means of defence may be given through means of sexual selection as the mane to the lion the shoulder pad to the boar and the hooked jaw to the male salmon for the shield may be as important for victory as the sword or spear amongst birds the contest is often of a more peaceful character all those who have attended to the subject 89 believe that there is the severest rivalry between the males of many species to attract by singing the females the rock thrush of guiana birds of paradise and some others congregate and successive males display their gorgeous plumage and perform strange antics before the females which standing by as spectators at last choose the most attractive partner those who have closely attended to birds in confinement well know that they often take individual preferences and dislikes thus sir r heron has described how one pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen birds it may appear childish to attribute any effect to such apparently weak means i cannot here enter on the details necessary to support this view but if man can in a short time give elegant carriage and beauty to his bantams according to his standard of beauty i can see no good reason to doubt that female birds by selecting during thousands of generations the most melodious or beautiful males according to their standard of beauty might produce a marked effect i strongly suspect that some well known laws with respect to the plumage of male and female birds in comparison with the plumage of the young can be explained on the view of plumage having been chiefly modified by sexual selection acting when the birds have come to the breeding age or during the breeding season the modifications thus produced being inherited at corresponding ages or seasons either by the males alone or by the males and females but i have not space here to enter on this subject thus it is as i believe that when the males and females of any animal have the same general habits of life but differ in structure colour or ornament such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection that is individual males have had in successive generations some slight advantage over other 90 males in their weapons means of defence or charms and have transmitted these advantages to their male offspring yet i would not wish to attribute all such sexual differences to this agency for we see peculiarities arising and becoming attached to the male sex in our domestic animals as the wattle in male carriers horn like protuberances in the cocks of certain fowls c which we cannot believe to be either useful to the males in battle or attractive to the females we see analogous cases under nature for instance the tuft of hair on the breast of the turkey cock which can hardly be either useful or ornamental to this bird indeed had the tuft appeared under domestication it would have been called a monstrosity illustrations of the action of natural selection in order to make it clear how as i believe natural selection acts i must beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations let us take the case of a wolf which preys on various animals securing some by craft some by strength and some by fleetness and let us suppose that the fleetest prey a deer for instance had from any change in the country increased in numbers or that other prey had decreased in numbers during that season of the year when the wolf is hardest pressed for food i can under such circumstances see no reason to doubt that the swiftest and slimmest wolves would have the best chance of surviving and so be preserved or selected provided always that they retained strength to master their prey at this or at some other period of the year when they might be compelled to prey on other animals i can see no more reason to doubt this than that man can improve the fleetness of his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection or by that unconscious selection which results from each man trying 91 to keep the best dogs without any thought of modifying the breed even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals on which our wolf preyed a cub might be born with an innate tendency to pursue certain kinds of prey nor can this be thought very improbable for we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of our domestic animals one cat for instance taking to catch rats another mice one cat according to mr st john bringing home winged game another hares or rabbits and another hunting on marshy ground and almost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes the tendency to catch rats rather than mice is known to be inherited now if any slight innate change of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf it would have the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring some of its young would probably inherit the same habits or structure and by the repetition of this process a new variety might be formed which would either supplant or coexist with the parent form of wolf or again the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district and those frequenting the lowlands would naturally be forced to hunt different prey and from the continued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites two varieties might slowly be formed these varieties would cross and blend where they met but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soon have to return i may add that according to mr pierce there are two varieties of the wolf inhabiting the catskill mountains in the united states one with a light greyhound like form which pursues deer and the other more bulky with shorter legs which more frequently attacks the shepherd s flocks let us now take a more complex case certain plants excrete a sweet juice apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious from their sap this is 92 effected by glands at the base of the stipules in some leguminosг and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel this juice though small in quantity is greedily sought by insects let us now suppose a little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by the inner bases of the petals of a flower in this case insects in seeking the nectar would get dusted with pollen and would certainly often transport the pollen from one flower to the stigma of another flower the flowers of two distinct individuals of the same species would thus get crossed and the act of crossing we have good reason to believe as will hereafter be more fully alluded to would produce very vigorous seedlings which consequently would have the best chance of flourishing and surviving some of these seedlings would probably inherit the nectar excreting power those individual flowers which had the largest glands or nectaries and which excreted most nectar would be oftenest visited by insects and would be oftenest crossed and so in the long run would gain the upper hand those flowers also which had their stamens and pistils placed in relation to the size and habits of the particular insects which visited them so as to favour in any degree the transportal of their pollen from flower to flower would likewise be favoured or selected we might have taken the case of insects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar and as pollen is formed for the sole object of fertilisation its destruction appears a simple loss to the plant yet if a little pollen were carried at first occasionally and then habitually by the pollen devouring insects from flower to flower and a cross thus effected although nine tenths of the pollen were destroyed it might still be a great gain to the plant and those individuals which produced more and more pollen and had larger and larger anthers would be selected 93 when our plant by this process of the continued preservation or natural selection of more and more attractive flowers had been rendered highly attractive to insects they would unintentionally on their part regularly carry pollen from flower to flower and that they can most effectually do this i could easily show by many striking instances i will give only one not as a very striking case but as likewise illustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of plants presently to be alluded to some holly trees bear only male flowers which have four stamens producing a rather small quantity of pollen and a rudimentary pistil other holly trees bear only female flowers these have a full sized pistil and four stamens with shrivelled anthers in which not a grain of pollen can be detected having found a female tree exactly sixty yards from a male tree i put the stigmas of twenty flowers taken from different branches under the microscope and on all without exception there were pollen grains and on some a profusion of pollen as the wind had set for several days from the female to the male tree the pollen could not thus have been carried the weather had been cold and boisterous and therefore not favourable to bees nevertheless every female flower which i examined had been effectually fertilised by the bees accidentally dusted with pollen having flown from tree to tree in search of nectar but to return to our imaginary case as soon as the plant had been rendered so highly attractive to insects that pollen was regularly carried from flower to flower another process might commence no naturalist doubts the advantage of what has been called the physiological division of labour hence we may believe that it would be advantageous to a plant to produce stamens alone in one flower or on one whole plant and pistils alone in 94 another flower or on another plant in plants under culture and placed under new conditions of life sometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs become more or less impotent now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree under nature then as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to flower and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the principle of the division of labour individuals with this tendency more and more increased would be continually favoured or selected until at last a complete separation of the sexes would be effected let us now turn to the nectar feeding insects in our imaginary case we may suppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectar by continued selection to be a common plant and that certain insects depended in main part on its nectar for food i could give many facts showing how anxious bees are to save time for instance their habit of cutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers which they can with a very little more trouble enter by the mouth bearing such facts in mind i can see no reason to doubt that an accidental deviation in the size and form of the body or in the curvature and length of the proboscis c far too slight to be appreciated by us might profit a bee or other insect so that an individual so characterised would be able to obtain its food more quickly and so have a better chance of living and leaving descendants its descendants would probably inherit a tendency to a similar slight deviation of structure the tubes of the corollas of the common red and incarnate clovers trifolium pratense and incarnatum do not on a hasty glance appear to differ in length yet the hive bee can easily suck the nectar out of the incarnate clover but not out of the common red 95 clover which is visited by humble bees alone so that whole fields of the red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hive bee thus it might be a great advantage to the hive bee to have a slightly longer or differently constructed proboscis on the other hand i have found by experiment that the fertility of clover depends on bees visiting and moving parts of the corolla so as to push the pollen on to the stigmatic surface hence again if humble bees were to become rare in any country it might be a great advantage to the red clover to have a shorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla so that the hive bee could visit its flowers thus i can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become either simultaneously or one after the other modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure i am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection exemplified in the above imaginary instances is open to the same objections which were at first urged against sir charles lyell s noble views on the modern changes of the earth as illustrative of geology but we now seldom hear the action for instance of the coast waves called a trifling and insignificant cause when applied to the excavation of gigantic valleys or to the formation of the longest lines of inland cliffs natural selection can act only by the preservation and accumulation of infinitesimally small inherited modifications each profitable to the preserved being and as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single diluvial wave so will natural selection if it be a true principle banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic 96 beings or of any great and sudden modification in their structure on the intercrossing of individuals i must here introduce a short digression in the case of animals and plants with separated sexes it is of course obvious that two individuals must always with the exception of the curious and not well understood cases of parthenogenesis unite for each birth but in the case of hermaphrodites this is far from obvious nevertheless i am strongly inclined to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals either occasionally or habitually concur for the reproduction of their kind this view was first suggested by andrew knight we shall presently see its importance but i must here treat the subject with extreme brevity though i have the materials prepared for an ample discussion all vertebrate animals all insects and some other large groups of animals pair for each birth modern research has much diminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites and of real hermaphrodites a large number pair that is two individuals regularly unite for reproduction which is all that concerns us but still there are many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair and a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites what reason it may be asked is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals ever concur in reproduction as it is impossible here to enter on details i must trust to some general considerations alone in the first place i have collected so large a body of facts showing in accordance with the almost universal belief of breeders that with animals and plants a cross between different varieties or between individuals of the same variety but of another strain gives vigour and 97 fertility to the offspring and on the other hand that close interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility that these facts alone incline me to believe that it is a general law of nature utterly ignorant though we be of the meaning of the law that no organic being self fertilises itself for an eternity of generations but that a cross with another individual is occasionally perhaps at very long intervals indispensable on the belief that this is a law of nature we can i think understand several large classes of facts such as the following which on any other view are inexplicable every hybridizer knows how unfavourable exposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower yet what a multitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed to the weather but if an occasional cross be indispensable the fullest freedom for the entrance of pollen from another individual will explain this state of exposure more especially as the plant s own anthers and pistil generally stand so close together that self fertilisation seems almost inevitable many flowers on the other hand have their organs of fructification closely enclosed as in the great papilionaceous or pea family but in several perhaps in all such flowers there is a very curious adaptation between the structure of the flower and the manner in which bees suck the nectar for in doing this they either push the flower s own pollen on the stigma or bring pollen from another flower so necessary are the visits of bees to papilionaceous flowers that i have found by experiments published elsewhere that their fertility is greatly diminished if these visits be prevented now it is scarcely possible that bees should fly from flower to flower and not carry pollen from one to the other to the great good as i believe of the plant bees will act like a camel hair pencil and it is quite sufficient just to touch the anthers of 98 one flower and then the stigma of another with the same brush to ensure fertilisation but it must not be supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between distinct species for if you bring on the same brush a plant s own pollen and pollen from another species the former will have such a prepotent effect that it will invariably and completely destroy as has been shown by gг rtner any influence from the foreign pollen when the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil or slowly move one after the other towards it the contrivance seems adapted solely to ensure self fertilisation and no doubt it is useful for this end but the agency of insects is often required to cause the stamens to spring forward as kг lreuter has shown to be the case with the barberry and in this very genus which seems to have a special contrivance for self fertilisation it is well known that if closely allied forms or varieties are planted near each other it is hardly possible to raise pure seedlings so largely do they naturally cross in many other cases far from there being any aids for self fertilisation there are special contrivances as i could show from the writings of c c sprengel and from my own observations which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen from its own flower for instance in lobelia fulgens there is a really beautiful and elaborate contrivance by which every one of the infinitely numerous pollen granules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower before the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive them and as this flower is never visited at least in my garden by insects it never sets a seed though by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of another i raised plenty of seedlings and whilst another species of lobelia growing close by which is visited by bees seeds freely in very many other cases though there 99 be no special mechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma of a flower receiving its own pollen yet as c c sprengel has shown and as i can confirm either the anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation or the stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready so that these plants have in fact separated sexes and must habitually be crossed how strange are these facts how strange that the pollen and stigmatic surface of the same flower though placed so close together as if for the very purpose of self fertilisation should in so many cases be mutually useless to each other how simply are these facts explained on the view of an occasional cross with a distinct individual being advantageous or indispensable if several varieties of the cabbage radish onion and of some other plants be allowed to seed near each other a large majority as i have found of the seedlings thus raised will turn out mongrels for instance i raised 233 seedling cabbages from some plants of different varieties growing near each other and of these only 78 were true to their kind and some even of these were not perfectly true yet the pistil of each cabbage flower is surrounded not only by its own six stamens but by those of the many other flowers on the same plant how then comes it that such a vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized i suspect that it must arise from the pollen of a distinct variety having a prepotent effect over a flower s own pollen and that this is part of the general law of good being derived from the intercrossing of distinct individuals of the same species when distinct species are crossed the case is directly the reverse for a plant s own pollen is always prepotent over foreign pollen but to this subject we shall return in a future chapter in the case of a gigantic tree covered with 100 innumerable flowers it may be objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree and at most only from flower to flower on the same tree and that flowers on the same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in a limited sense i believe this objection to be valid but that nature has largely provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bear flowers with separated sexes when the sexes are separated although the male and female flowers may be produced on the same tree we can see that pollen must be regularly carried from flower to flower and this will give a better chance of pollen being occasionally carried from tree to tree that trees belonging to all orders have their sexes more often separated than other plants i find to be the case in this country and at my request dr hooker tabulated the trees of new zealand and dr asa gray those of the united states and the result was as i anticipated on the other hand dr hooker has recently informed me that he finds that the rule does not hold in australia and i have made these few remarks on the sexes of trees simply to call attention to the subject turning for a very brief space to animals on the land there are some hermaphrodites as land mollusca and earth worms but these all pair as yet i have not found a single case of a terrestrial animal which fertilises itself we can understand this remarkable fact which offers so strong a contrast with terrestrial plants on the view of an occasional cross being indispensable by considering the medium in which terrestrial animals live and the nature of the fertilising element for we know of no means analogous to the action of insects and of the wind in the case of plants by which an occasional cross could be effected with terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two individuals of aquatic animals there are many self fertilising hermaphrodites but here 101 currents in the water offer an obvious means for an occasional cross and as in the case of flowers i have as yet failed after consultation with one of the highest authorities namely professor huxley to discover a single case of an hermaphrodite animal with the organs of reproduction so perfectly enclosed within the body that access from without and the occasional influence of a distinct individual can be shown to be physically impossible cirripedes long appeared to me to present a case of very great difficulty under this point of view but i have been enabled by a fortunate chance elsewhere to prove that two individuals though both are self fertilising hermaphrodites do sometimes cross it must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that in the case of both animals and plants species of the same family and even of the same genus though agreeing closely with each other in almost their whole organisation yet are not rarely some of them hermaphrodites and some of them unisexual but if in fact all hermaphrodites do occasionally intercross with other individuals the difference between hermaphrodites and unisexual species as far as function is concerned becomes very small from these several considerations and from the many special facts which i have collected but which i am not here able to give i am strongly inclined to suspect that both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms an occasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law of nature i am well aware that there are on this view many cases of difficulty some of which i am trying to investigate finally then we may conclude that in many organic beings a cross between two individuals is an obvious necessity for each birth in many others it occurs perhaps only at long intervals but in none as i suspect can self fertilisation go on for perpetuity 102 circumstances favourable to natural selection this is an extremely intricate subject a large amount of inheritable and diversified variability is favourable but i believe mere individual differences suffice for the work a large number of individuals by giving a better chance for the appearance within any given period of profitable variations will compensate for a lesser amount of variability in each individual and is i believe an extremely important element of success though nature grants vast periods of time for the work of natural selection she does not grant an indefinite period for as all organic beings are striving it may be said to seize on each place in the economy of nature if any one species does not become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with its competitors it will soon be exterminated in man s methodical selection a breeder selects for some definite object and free intercrossing will wholly stop his work but when many men without intending to alter the breed have a nearly common standard of perfection and all try to get and breed from the best animals much improvement and modification surely but slowly follow from this unconscious process of selection notwithstanding a large amount of crossing with inferior animals thus it will be in nature for within a confined area with some place in its polity not so perfectly occupied as might be natural selection will always tend to preserve all the individuals varying in the right direction though in different degrees so as better to fill up the unoccupied place but if the area be large its several districts will almost certainly present different conditions of life and then if natural selection be modifying and improving a species in the several districts there will be intercrossing with the other individuals of the same species on the confines of each and in 103 this case the effects of intercrossing can hardly be counterbalanced by natural selection always tending to modify all the individuals in each district in exactly the same manner to the conditions of each for in a continuous area the physical conditions at least will generally graduate away insensibly from one district to another the intercrossing will most affect those animals which unite for each birth which wander much and which do not breed at a very quick rate hence in animals of this nature for instance in birds varieties will generally be confined to separated countries and this i believe to be the case in hermaphrodite organisms which cross only occasionally and likewise in animals which unite for each birth but which wander little and which can increase at a very rapid rate a new and improved variety might be quickly formed on any one spot and might there maintain itself in a body so that whatever intercrossing took place would be chiefly between the individuals of the same new variety a local variety when once thus formed might subsequently slowly spread to other districts on the above principle nurserymen always prefer getting seed from a large body of plants of the same variety as the chance of intercrossing with other varieties is thus lessened even in the case of slow breeding animals which unite for each birth we must not overrate the effects of intercrosses in retarding natural selection for i can bring a considerable catalogue of facts showing that within the same area varieties of the same animal can long remain distinct from haunting different stations from breeding at slightly different seasons or from varieties of the same kind preferring to pair together intercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping the individuals of the same species or of the same variety true and uniform in character it will 104 obviously thus act far more efficiently with those animals which unite for each birth but i have already attempted to show that we have reason to believe that occasional intercrosses take place with all animals and with all plants even if these take place only at long intervals i am convinced that the young thus produced will gain so much in vigour and fertility over the offspring from long continued self fertilisation that they will have a better chance of surviving and propagating their kind and thus in the long run the influence of intercrosses even at rare intervals will be great if there exist organic beings which never intercross uniformity of character can be retained amongst them as long as their conditions of life remain the same only through the principle of inheritance and through natural selection destroying any which depart from the proper type but if their conditions of life change and they undergo modification uniformity of character can be given to their modified offspring solely by natural selection preserving the same favourable variations isolation also is an important element in the process of natural selection in a confined or isolated area if not very large the organic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be in a great degree uniform so that natural selection will tend to modify all the individuals of a varying species throughout the area in the same manner in relation to the same conditions intercrosses also with the individuals of the same species which otherwise would have inhabited the surrounding and differently circumstanced districts will be prevented but isolation probably acts more efficiently in checking the immigration of better adapted organisms after any physical change such as of climate or elevation of the land c and thus new places in the natural economy of the country are left open for the old inhabitants to struggle for and become adapted to through 105 modifications in their structure and constitution lastly isolation by checking immigration and consequently competition will give time for any new variety to be slowly improved and this may sometimes be of importance in the production of new species if however an isolated area be very small either from being surrounded by barriers or from having very peculiar physical conditions the total number of the individuals supported on it will necessarily be very small and fewness of individuals will greatly retard the production of new species through natural selection by decreasing the chance of the appearance of favourable variations if we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks and look at any small isolated area such as an oceanic island although the total number of the species inhabiting it will be found to be small as we shall see in our chapter on geographical distribution yet of these species a very large proportion are endemic that is have been produced there and nowhere else hence an oceanic island at first sight seems to have been highly favourable for the production of new species but we may thus greatly deceive ourselves for to ascertain whether a small isolated area or a large open area like a continent has been most favourable for the production of new organic forms we ought to make the comparison within equal times and this we are incapable of doing although i do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importance in the production of new species on the whole i am inclined to believe that largeness of area is of more importance more especially in the production of species which will prove capable of enduring for a long period and of spreading widely throughout a great and open area not only will there be a better chance of favourable variations arising from the large number of individuals of the same species 106 there supported but the conditions of life are infinitely complex from the large number of already existing species and if some of these many species become modified and improved others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree or they will be exterminated each new form also as soon as it has been much improved will be able to spread over the open and continuous area and will thus come into competition with many others hence more new places will be formed and the competition to fill them will be more severe on a large than on a small and isolated area moreover great areas though now continuous owing to oscillations of level will often have recently existed in a broken condition so that the good effects of isolation will generally to a certain extent have concurred finally i conclude that although small isolated areas probably have been in some respects highly favourable for the production of new species yet that the course of modification will generally have been more rapid on large areas and what is more important that the new forms produced on large areas which already have been victorious over many competitors will be those that will spread most widely will give rise to most new varieties and species and will thus play an important part in the changing history of the organic world we can perhaps on these views understand some facts which will be again alluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution for instance that the productions of the smaller continent of australia have formerly yielded and apparently are now yielding before those of the larger europг o asiatic area thus also it is that continental productions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands on a small island the race for life will have been less severe and there will have been less modification and less 107 extermination hence perhaps it comes that the flora of madeira according to oswald heer resembles the extinct tertiary flora of europe all fresh water basins taken together make a small area compared with that of the sea or of the land and consequently the competition between fresh water productions will have been less severe than elsewhere new forms will have been more slowly formed and old forms more slowly exterminated and it is in fresh water that we find seven genera of ganoid fishes remnants of a once preponderant order and in fresh water we find some of the most anomalous forms now known in the world as the ornithorhynchus and lepidosiren which like fossils connect to a certain extent orders now widely separated in the natural scale these anomalous forms may almost be called living fossils they have endured to the present day from having inhabited a confined area and from having thus been exposed to less severe competition to sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural selection as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits i conclude looking to the future that for terrestrial productions a large continental area which will probably undergo many oscillations of level and which consequently will exist for long periods in a broken condition is the most favourable for the production of many new forms of life likely to endure long and to spread widely for the area first existed as a continent and the inhabitants at this period numerous in individuals and kinds will have been subjected to very severe competition when converted by subsidence into large separate islands there will still exist many individuals of the same species on each island intercrossing on the confines of the range of each species will thus be checked after physical changes of any kind immigration will be 108 prevented so that new places in the polity of each island will have to be filled up by modifications of the old inhabitants and time will be allowed for the varieties in each to become well modified and perfected when by renewed elevation the islands shall be re converted into a continental area there will again be severe competition the most favoured or improved varieties will be enabled to spread there will be much extinction of the less improved forms and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitants of the renewed continent will again be changed and again there will be a fair field for natural selection to improve still further the inhabitants and thus produce new species that natural selection will always act with extreme slowness i fully admit its action depends on there being places in the polity of nature which can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the country undergoing modification of some kind the existence of such places will often depend on physical changes which are generally very slow and on the immigration of better adapted forms having been checked but the action of natural selection will probably still oftener depend on some of the inhabitants becoming slowly modified the mutual relations of many of the other inhabitants being thus disturbed nothing can be effected unless favourable variations occur and variation itself is apparently always a very slow process the process will often be greatly retarded by free intercrossing many will exclaim that these several causes are amply sufficient wholly to stop the action of natural selection i do not believe so on the other hand i do believe that natural selection always acts very slowly often only at long intervals of time and generally on only a very few of the inhabitants of the same region at the same time i further believe that this very slow 109 intermittent action of natural selection accords perfectly well with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which the inhabitants of this world have changed slow though the process of selection may be if feeble man can do much by his powers of artificial selection i can see no limit to the amount of change to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptations between all organic beings one with another and with their physical conditions of life which may be effected in the long course of time by nature s power of selection extinction this subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on geology but it must be here alluded to from being intimately connected with natural selection natural selection acts solely through the preservation of variations in some way advantageous which consequently endure but as from the high geometrical ratio of increase of all organic beings each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants it follows that as each selected and favoured form increases in number so will the less favoured forms decrease and become rare rarity as geology tells us is the precursor to extinction we can also see that any form represented by few individuals will during fluctuations in the seasons or in the number of its enemies run a good chance of utter extinction but we may go further than this for as new forms are continually and slowly being produced unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes on perpetually and almost indefinitely increasing numbers inevitably must become extinct that the number of specific forms has not indefinitely increased geology shows us plainly and indeed we can see reason why they should not have thus increased for the number of places in the polity of nature is not indefinitely great not that we 110 have any means of knowing that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species probably no region is as yet fully stocked for at the cape of good hope where more species of plants are crowded together than in any other quarter of the world some foreign plants have become naturalised without causing as far as we know the extinction of any natives furthermore the species which are most numerous in individuals will have the best chance of producing within any given period favourable variations we have evidence of this in the facts given in the second chapter showing that it is the common species which afford the greatest number of recorded varieties or incipient species hence rare species will be less quickly modified or improved within any given period and they will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the modified descendants of the commoner species from these several considerations i think it inevitably follows that as new species in the course of time are formed through natural selection others will become rarer and rarer and finally extinct the forms which stand in closest competition with those undergoing modification and improvement will naturally suffer most and we have seen in the chapter on the struggle for existence that it is the most closely allied forms varieties of the same species and species of the same genus or of related genera which from having nearly the same structure constitution and habits generally come into the severest competition with each other consequently each new variety or species during the progress of its formation will generally press hardest on its nearest kindred and tend to exterminate them we see the same process of extermination amongst our domesticated productions through the selection of improved forms by man many curious 111 instances could be given showing how quickly new breeds of cattle sheep and other animals and varieties of flowers take the place of older and inferior kinds in yorkshire it is historically known that the ancient black cattle were displaced by the long horns and that these were swept away by the short horns i quote the words of an agricultural writer as if by some murderous pestilence divergence of character the principle which i have designated by this term is of high importance on my theory and explains as i believe several important facts in the first place varieties even strongly marked ones though having somewhat of the character of species as is shown by the hopeless doubts in many cases how to rank them yet certainly differ from each other far less than do good and distinct species nevertheless according to my view varieties are species in the process of formation or are as i have called them incipient species how then does the lesser difference between varieties become augmented into the greater difference between species that this does habitually happen we must infer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presenting well marked differences whereas varieties the supposed prototypes and parents of future well marked species present slight and ill defined differences mere chance as we may call it might cause one variety to differ in some character from its parents and the offspring of this variety again to differ from its parent in the very same character and in a greater degree but this alone would never account for so habitual and large an amount of difference as that between varieties of the same species and species of the same genus as has always been my practice let us seek light on 112 this head from our domestic productions we shall here find something analogous a fancier is struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak another fancier is struck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak and on the acknowledged principle that fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard but like extremes they both go on as has actually occurred with tumbler pigeons choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longer beaks or with shorter and shorter beaks again we may suppose that at an early period one man preferred swifter horses another stronger and more bulky horses the early differences would be very slight in the course of time from the continued selection of swifter horses by some breeders and of stronger ones by others the differences would become greater and would be noted as forming two sub breeds finally after the lapse of centuries the sub breeds would become converted into two well established and distinct breeds as the differences slowly become greater the inferior animals with intermediate characters being neither very swift nor very strong will have been neglected and will have tended to disappear here then we see in man s productions the action of what may be called the principle of divergence causing differences at first barely appreciable steadily to increase and the breeds to diverge in character both from each other and from their common parent but how it may be asked can any analogous principle apply in nature i believe it can and does apply most efficiently from the simple circumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any one species become in structure constitution and habits by so much will they be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places in the polity of nature and so be enabled to increase in numbers 113 we can clearly see this in the case of animals with simple habits take the case of a carnivorous quadruped of which the number that can be supported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average if its natural powers of increase be allowed to act it can succeed in increasing the country not undergoing any change in its conditions only by its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied by other animals some of them for instance being enabled to feed on new kinds of prey either dead or alive some inhabiting new stations climbing trees frequenting water and some perhaps becoming less carnivorous the more diversified in habits and structure the descendants of our carnivorous animal became the more places they would be enabled to occupy what applies to one animal will apply throughout all time to all animals that is if they vary for otherwise natural selection can do nothing so it will be with plants it has been experimentally proved that if a plot of ground be sown with one species of grass and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera of grasses a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbage can thus be raised the same has been found to hold good when first one variety and then several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown on equal spaces of ground hence if any one species of grass were to go on varying and those varieties were continually selected which differed from each other in at all the same manner as distinct species and genera of grasses differ from each other a greater number of individual plants of this species of grass including its modified descendants would succeed in living on the same piece of ground and we well know that each species and each variety of grass is annually sowing almost countless seeds and thus as it may be said is striving its utmost to increase its numbers 114 consequently i cannot doubt that in the course of many thousands of generations the most distinct varieties of any one species of grass would always have the best chance of succeeding and of increasing in numbers and thus of supplanting the less distinct varieties and varieties when rendered very distinct from each other take the rank of species the truth of the principle that the greatest amount of life can be supported by great diversification of structure is seen under many natural circumstances in an extremely small area especially if freely open to immigration and where the contest between individual and individual must be severe we always find great diversity in its inhabitants for instance i found that a piece of turf three feet by four in size which had been exposed for many years to exactly the same conditions supported twenty species of plants and these belonged to eighteen genera and to eight orders which shows how much these plants differed from each other so it is with the plants and insects on small and uniform islets and so in small ponds of fresh water farmers find that they can raise most food by a rotation of plants belonging to the most different orders nature follows what may be called a simultaneous rotation most of the animals and plants which live close round any small piece of ground could live on it supposing it not to be in any way peculiar in its nature and may be said to be striving to the utmost to live there but it is seen that where they come into the closest competition with each other the advantages of diversification of structure with the accompanying differences of habit and constitution determine that the inhabitants which thus jostle each other most closely shall as a general rule belong to what we call different genera and orders the same principle is seen in the naturalisation of 115 plants through man s agency in foreign lands it might have been expected that the plants which have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would generally have been closely allied to the indigenes for these are commonly looked at as specially created and adapted for their own country it might also perhaps have been expected that naturalised plants would have belonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations in their new homes but the case is very different and alph de candolle has well remarked in his great and admirable work that floras gain by naturalisation proportionally with the number of the native genera and species far more in new genera than in new species to give a single instance in the last edition of dr asa gray s manual of the flora of the northern united states 260 naturalised plants are enumerated and these belong to 162 genera we thus see that these naturalised plants are of a highly diversified nature they differ moreover to a large extent from the indigenes for out of the 162 genera no less than 100 genera are not there indigenous and thus a large proportional addition is made to the genera of these states by considering the nature of the plants or animals which have struggled successfully with the indigenes of any country and have there become naturalised we may gain some crude idea in what manner some of the natives would have to be modified in order to gain an advantage over the other natives and we may at least safely infer that diversification of structure amounting to new generic differences would be profitable to them the advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same region is in fact the same as that of the physiological division of labour in the organs of the same individual body a subject so well elucidated by milne 116 edwards no physiologist doubts that a stomach adapted to digest vegetable matter alone or flesh alone draws most nutriment from these substances so in the general economy of any land the more widely and perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for different habits of life so will a greater number of individuals be capable of there supporting themselves a set of animals with their organisation but little diversified could hardly compete with a set more perfectly diversified in structure it may be doubted for instance whether the australian marsupials which are divided into groups differing but little from each other and feebly representing as mr waterhouse and others have remarked our carnivorous ruminant and rodent mammals could successfully compete with these well pronounced orders in the australian mammals we see the process of diversification in an early and incomplete stage of development after the foregoing discussion which ought to have been much amplified we may i think assume that the modified descendants of any one species will succeed by so much the better as they become more diversified in structure and are thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings now let us see how this principle of benefit being derived from divergence of character combined with the principles of natural selection and of extinction will tend to act the accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this rather perplexing subject let a to l represent the species of a genus large in its own country these species are supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees as is so generally the case in nature and as is represented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances i have said a large genus because we have seen in the second chapter 117 that on an average more of the species of large genera vary than of small genera and the varying species of the large genera present a greater number of varieties we have also seen that the species which are the commonest and the most widely diffused vary more than rare species with restricted ranges let a be a common widely diffused and varying species belonging to a genus large in its own country the little fan of diverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from a may represent its varying offspring the variations are supposed to be extremely slight but of the most diversified nature they are not supposed all to appear simultaneously but often after long intervals of time nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods only those variations which are in some way profitable will be preserved or naturally selected and here the importance of the principle of benefit being derived from divergence of character comes in for this will generally lead to the most different or divergent variations represented by the outer dotted lines being preserved and accumulated by natural selection when a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal lines and is there marked by a small numbered letter a sufficient amount of variation is supposed to have been accumulated to have formed a fairly well marked variety such as would be thought worthy of record in a systematic work illustration the intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram may represent each a thousand generations but it would have been better if each had represented ten thousand generations after a thousand generations species a is supposed to have produced two fairly well marked varieties namely a 1 and m 1 these two varieties will generally continue to be exposed to the same conditions which made their parents variable 118 and the tendency to variability is in itself hereditary consequently they will tend to vary and generally to vary in nearly the same manner as their parents varied moreover these two varieties being only slightly modified forms will tend to inherit those advantages which made their parent a more numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same country they will likewise partake of those more general advantages which made the genus to which the parent species belonged a large genus in its own country and these circumstances we know to be favourable to the production of new varieties if then these two varieties be variable the most divergent of their variations will generally be preserved during the next thousand generations and after this interval variety a 1 is supposed in the diagram to have produced variety a 2 which will owing to the principle of divergence differ more from a than did variety a 1 variety m 1 is supposed to have produced two varieties namely m 2 and s 2 differing from each other and more considerably from their common parent a we may continue the process by similar steps for any length of time some of the varieties after each thousand generations producing only a single variety but in a more and more modified condition some producing two or three varieties and some failing to produce any thus the varieties or modified descendants proceeding from the common parent a will generally go on increasing in number and diverging in character in the diagram the process is represented up to the ten thousandth generation and under a condensed and simplified form up to the fourteen thousandth generation but i must here remark that i do not suppose that the process ever goes on so regularly as is represented in the diagram though in itself made somewhat irregular 119 i am far from thinking that the most divergent varieties will invariably prevail and multiply a medium form may often long endure and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant for natural selection will always act according to the nature of the places which are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings and this will depend on infinitely complex relations but as a general rule the more diversified in structure the descendants from any one species can be rendered the more places they will be enabled to seize on and the more their modified progeny will be increased in our diagram the line of succession is broken at regular intervals by small numbered letters marking the successive forms which have become sufficiently distinct to be recorded as varieties but these breaks are imaginary and might have been inserted anywhere after intervals long enough to have allowed the accumulation of a considerable amount of divergent variation as all the modified descendants from a common and widely diffused species belonging to a large genus will tend to partake of the same advantages which made their parent successful in life they will generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in character this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches proceeding from a the modified offspring from the later and more highly improved branches in the lines of descent will it is probable often take the place of and so destroy the earlier and less improved branches this is represented in the diagram by some of the lower branches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines in some cases i do not doubt that the process of modification will be confined to a single line of descent and the number of the descendants will not be increased although the amount 120 of divergent modification may have been increased in the successive generations this case would be represented in the diagram if all the lines proceeding from a were removed excepting that from a 1 to a 10 in the same way for instance the english race horse and english pointer have apparently both gone on slowly diverging in character from their original stocks without either having given off any fresh branches or races after ten thousand generations species a is supposed to have produced three forms a 10 f 10 and m 10 which from having diverged in character during the successive generations will have come to differ largely but perhaps unequally from each other and from their common parent if we suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagram to be excessively small these three forms may still be only well marked varieties or they may have arrived at the doubtful category of sub species but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of modification to be more numerous or greater in amount to convert these three forms into well defined species thus the diagram illustrates the steps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties are increased into the larger differences distinguishing species by continuing the same process for a greater number of generations as shown in the diagram in a condensed and simplified manner we get eight species marked by the letters between a 14 and m 14 all descended from a thus as i believe species are multiplied and genera are formed in a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary in the diagram i have assumed that a second species i has produced by analogous steps after ten thousand generations either two well marked varieties w 10 and z 10 or two species according to the amount of change supposed to be represented 121 between the horizontal lines after fourteen thousand generations six new species marked by the letters n 14 to z 14 are supposed to have been produced in each genus the species which are already extremely different in character will generally tend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants for these will have the best chance of filling new and widely different places in the polity of nature hence in the diagram i have chosen the extreme species a and the nearly extreme species i as those which have largely varied and have given rise to new varieties and species the other nine species marked by capital letters of our original genus may for a long period continue to transmit unaltered descendants and this is shown in the diagram by the dotted lines not prolonged far upwards from want of space but during the process of modification represented in the diagram another of our principles namely that of extinction will have played an important part as in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life over other forms there will be a constant tendency in the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent their predecessors and their original parent for it should be remembered that the competition will generally be most severe between those forms which are most nearly related to each other in habits constitution and structure hence all the intermediate forms between the earlier and later states that is between the less and more improved state of a species as well as the original parent species itself will generally tend to become extinct so it probably will be with many whole collateral lines of descent which will be conquered by later and improved lines of descent if however the 122 modified offspring of a species get into some distinct country or become quickly adapted to some quite new station in which child and parent do not come into competition both may continue to exist if then our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount of modification species a and all the earlier varieties will have become extinct having been replaced by eight new species a 14 to m 14 and i will have been replaced by six n 14 to z 14 new species but we may go further than this the original species of our genus were supposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees as is so generally the case in nature species a being more nearly related to b c and d than to the other species and species i more to g h k l than to the others these two species a and i were also supposed to be very common and widely diffused species so that they must originally have had some advantage over most of the other species of the genus their modified descendants fourteen in number at the fourteen thousandth generation will probably have inherited some of the same advantages they have also been modified and improved in a diversified manner at each stage of descent so as to have become adapted to many related places in the natural economy of their country it seems therefore to me extremely probable that they will have taken the places of and thus exterminated not only their parents a and i but likewise some of the original species which were most nearly related to their parents hence very few of the original species will have transmitted offspring to the fourteen thousandth generation we may suppose that only one f of the two species which were least closely related to the other nine original species has transmitted descendants to this late stage of descent 123 the new species in our diagram descended from the original eleven species will now be fifteen in number owing to the divergent tendency of natural selection the extreme amount of difference in character between species a 14 and z 14 will be much greater than that between the most different of the original eleven species the new species moreover will be allied to each other in a widely different manner of the eight descendants from a the three marked a 14 q 14 p 14 will be nearly related from having recently branched off from a 10 b 14 and f 14 from having diverged at an earlier period from a 5 will be in some degree distinct from the three first named species and lastly o 14 e 14 and m 14 will be nearly related one to the other but from having diverged at the first commencement of the process of modification will be widely different from the other five species and may constitute a sub genus or even a distinct genus the six descendants from i will form two sub genera or even genera but as the original species i differed largely from a standing nearly at the extreme points of the original genus the six descendants from i will owing to inheritance alone differ considerably from the eight descendants from a the two groups moreover are supposed to have gone on diverging in different directions the intermediate species also and this is a very important consideration which connected the original species a and i have all become excepting f extinct and have left no descendants hence the six new species descended from i and the eight descended from a will have to be ranked as very distinct genera or even as distinct sub families thus it is as i believe that two or more genera are produced by descent with modification from two or more species of the same genus and the two or 124 more parent species are supposed to have descended from some one species of an earlier genus in our diagram this is indicated by the broken lines beneath the capital letters converging in sub branches downwards towards a single point this point representing a single species the supposed single parent of our several new sub genera and genera it is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the new species f 14 which is supposed not to have diverged much in character but to have retained the form of f either unaltered or altered only in a slight degree in this case its affinities to the other fourteen new species will be of a curious and circuitous nature having descended from a form which stood between the two parent species a and i now supposed to be extinct and unknown it will be in some degree intermediate in character between the two groups descended from these species but as these two groups have gone on diverging in character from the type of their parents the new species f 14 will not be directly intermediate between them but rather between types of the two groups and every naturalist will be able to bring some such case before his mind in the diagram each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed to represent a thousand generations but each may represent a million or hundred million generations and likewise a section of the successive strata of the earth s crust including extinct remains we shall when we come to our chapter on geology have to refer again to this subject and i think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on the affinities of extinct beings which though generally belonging to the same orders or families or genera with those now living yet are often in some degree intermediate in character between existing groups and we can understand this fact for 125 the extinct species lived at very ancient epochs when the branching lines of descent had diverged less i see no reason to limit the process of modification as now explained to the formation of genera alone if in our diagram we suppose the amount of change represented by each successive group of diverging dotted lines to be very great the forms marked a 14 to p 14 those marked b 14 and f 14 and those marked o 14 to m 14 will form three very distinct genera we shall also have two very distinct genera descended from i and as these latter two genera both from continued divergence of character and from inheritance from a different parent will differ widely from the three genera descended from a the two little groups of genera will form two distinct families or even orders according to the amount of divergent modification supposed to be represented in the diagram and the two new families or orders will have descended from two species of the original genus and these two species are supposed to have descended from one species of a still more ancient and unknown genus we have seen that in each country it is the species of the larger genera which oftenest present varieties or incipient species this indeed might have been expected for as natural selection acts through one form having some advantage over other forms in the struggle for existence it will chiefly act on those which already have some advantage and the largeness of any group shows that its species have inherited from a common ancestor some advantage in common hence the struggle for the production of new and modified descendants will mainly lie between the larger groups which are all trying to increase in number one large group will slowly conquer another large group reduce its numbers and thus lessen its chance of further variation and improvement within the same large 126 group the later and more highly perfected sub groups from branching out and seizing on many new places in the polity of nature will constantly tend to supplant and destroy the earlier and less improved sub groups small and broken groups and sub groups will finally disappear looking to the future we can predict that the groups of organic beings which are now large and triumphant and which are least broken up that is which as yet have suffered least extinction will for a long period continue to increase but which groups will ultimately prevail no man can predict for we well know that many groups formerly most extensively developed have now become extinct looking still more remotely to the future we may predict that owing to the continued and steady increase of the larger groups a multitude of smaller groups will become utterly extinct and leave no modified descendants and consequently that of the species living at any one period extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote futurity i shall have to return to this subject in the chapter on classification but i may add that on this view of extremely few of the more ancient species having transmitted descendants and on the view of all the descendants of the same species making a class we can understand how it is that there exist but very few classes in each main division of the animal and vegetable kingdoms although extremely few of the most ancient species may now have living and modified descendants yet at the most remote geological period the earth may have been as well peopled with many species of many genera families orders and classes as at the present day summary of chapter if during the long course of ages and under varying conditions of life organic beings 127 vary at all in the several parts of their organisation and i think this cannot be disputed if there be owing to the high geometrical ratio of increase of each species a severe struggle for life at some age season or year and this certainly cannot be disputed then considering the infinite complexity of the relations of all organic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence causing an infinite diversity in structure constitution and habits to be advantageous to them i think it would be a most extraordinary fact if no variation ever had occurred useful to each being s own welfare in the same manner as so many variations have occurred useful to man but if variations useful to any organic being do occur assuredly individuals thus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly characterised this principle of preservation i have called for the sake of brevity natural selection and it leads to the improvement of each creature in relation to its organic and inorganic conditions of life natural selection on the principle of qualities being inherited at corresponding ages can modify the egg seed or young as easily as the adult amongst many animals sexual selection will give its aid to ordinary selection by assuring to the most vigorous and best adapted males the greatest number of offspring sexual selection will also give characters useful to the males alone in their struggles with other males whether natural selection has really thus acted in nature in modifying and adapting the various forms of life to their several conditions and stations must be judged of by the general tenour and balance of evidence given in the following chapters but we already see how it entails extinction and how largely extinction 128 has acted in the world s history geology plainly declares natural selection also leads to divergence of character for more living beings can be supported on the same area the more they diverge in structure habits and constitution of which we see proof by looking to the inhabitants of any small spot or to naturalised productions therefore during the modification of the descendants of any one species and during the incessant struggle of all species to increase in numbers the more diversified these descendants become the better will be their chance of succeeding in the battle for life thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the same species steadily tend to increase till they come to equal the greater differences between species of the same genus or even of distinct genera we have seen that it is the common the widely diffused and widely ranging species belonging to the larger genera which vary most and these tend to transmit to their modified offspring that superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries natural selection as has just been remarked leads to divergence of character and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediate forms of life on these principles i believe the nature of the affinities of all organic beings may be explained it is a truly wonderful fact the wonder of which we are apt to overlook from familiarity that all animals and all plants throughout all time and space should be related to each other in group subordinate to group in the manner which we everywhere behold namely varieties of the same species most closely related together species of the same genus less closely and unequally related together forming sections and sub genera species of distinct genera much less closely related and genera related in different degrees forming 129 sub families families orders sub classes and classes the several subordinate groups in any class cannot be ranked in a single file but seem rather to be clustered round points and these round other points and so on in almost endless cycles on the view that each species has been independently created i can see no explanation of this great fact in the classification of all organic beings but to the best of my judgment it is explained through inheritance and the complex action of natural selection entailing extinction and divergence of character as we have seen illustrated in the diagram the affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes been represented by a great tree i believe this simile largely speaks the truth the green and budding twigs may represent existing species and those produced during each former year may represent the long succession of extinct species at each period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out on all sides and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and branches in the same manner as species and groups of species have tried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life the limbs divided into great branches and these into lesser and lesser branches were themselves once when the tree was small budding twigs and this connexion of the former and present buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to groups of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was a mere bush only two or three now grown into great branches yet survive and bear all the other branches so with the species which lived during long past geological periods very few now have living and modified descendants from the first growth of the tree many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off and these lost branches of various 130 sizes may represent those whole orders families and genera which have now no living representatives and which are known to us only from having been found in a fossil state as we here and there see a thin straggling branch springing from a fork low down in a tree and which by some chance has been favoured and is still alive on its summit so we occasionally see an animal like the ornithorhynchus or lepidosiren which in some small degree connects by its affinities two large branches of life and which has apparently been saved from fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station as buds give rise by growth to fresh buds and these if vigorous branch out and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch so by generation i believe it has been with the great tree of life which fills with its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth and covers the surface with its ever branching and beautiful ramifications 131 chapter v laws of variation effects of external conditions use and disuse combined with natural selection organs of flight and of vision acclimatisation correlation of growth compensation and economy of growth false correlations multiple rudimentary and lowly organised structures variable parts developed in an unusual manner are highly variable specific characters more variable than generic secondary sexual characters variable species of the same genus vary in an analogous manner reversions to long lost characters summary i have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations so common and multiform in organic beings under domestication and in a lesser degree in those in a state of nature had been due to chance this of course is a wholly incorrect expression but it serves to acknowledge plainly our ignorance of the cause of each particular variation some authors believe it to be as much the function of the reproductive system to produce individual differences or very slight deviations of structure as to make the child like its parents but the much greater variability as well as the greater frequency of monstrosities under domestication or cultivation than under nature leads me to believe that deviations of structure are in some way due to the nature of the conditions of life to which the parents and their more remote ancestors have been exposed during several generations i have remarked in the first chapter but a long catalogue of facts which cannot be here given would be necessary to show the truth of the remark that the reproductive system is eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life and to 132 this system being functionally disturbed in the parents i chiefly attribute the varying or plastic condition of the offspring the male and female sexual elements seem to be affected before that union takes place which is to form a new being in the case of sporting plants the bud which in its earliest condition does not apparently differ essentially from an ovule is alone affected but why because the reproductive system is disturbed this or that part should vary more or less we are profoundly ignorant nevertheless we can here and there dimly catch a faint ray of light and we may feel sure that there must be some cause for each deviation of structure however slight how much direct effect difference of climate food c produces on any being is extremely doubtful my impression is that the effect is extremely small in the case of animals but perhaps rather more in that of plants we may at least safely conclude that such influences cannot have produced the many striking and complex co adaptations of structure between one organic being and another which we see everywhere throughout nature some little influence may be attributed to climate food c thus e forbes speaks confidently that shells at their southern limit and when living in shallow water are more brightly coloured than those of the same species further north or from greater depths gould believes that birds of the same species are more brightly coloured under a clear atmosphere than when living on islands or near the coast so with insects wollaston is convinced that residence near the sea affects their colours moquin tandon gives a list of plants which when growing near the sea shore have their leaves in some degree fleshy though not elsewhere fleshy several other such cases could be given the fact of varieties of one species when they range 133 into the zone of habitation of other species often acquiring in a very slight degree some of the characters of such species accords with our view that species of all kinds are only well marked and permanent varieties thus the species of shells which are confined to tropical and shallow seas are generally brighter coloured than those confined to cold and deeper seas the birds which are confined to continents are according to mr gould brighter coloured than those of islands the insect species confined to sea coasts as every collector knows are often brassy or lurid plants which live exclusively on the sea side are very apt to have fleshy leaves he who believes in the creation of each species will have to say that this shell for instance was created with bright colours for a warm sea but that this other shell became bright coloured by variation when it ranged into warmer or shallower waters when a variation is of the slightest use to a being we cannot tell how much of it to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection and how much to the conditions of life thus it is well known to furriers that animals of the same species have thicker and better fur the more severe the climate is under which they have lived but who can tell how much of this difference may be due to the warmest clad individuals having been favoured and preserved during many generations and how much to the direct action of the severe climate for it would appear that climate has some direct action on the hair of our domestic quadrupeds instances could be given of the same variety being produced under conditions of life as different as can well be conceived and on the other hand of different varieties being produced from the same species under the same conditions such facts show how indirectly 134 the conditions of life act again innumerable instances are known to every naturalist of species keeping true or not varying at all although living under the most opposite climates such considerations as these incline me to lay very little weight on the direct action of the conditions of life indirectly as already remarked they seem to play an important part in affecting the reproductive system and in thus inducing variability and natural selection will then accumulate all profitable variations however slight until they become plainly developed and appreciable by us effects of use and disuse from the facts alluded to in the first chapter i think there can be little doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlarges certain parts and disuse diminishes them and that such modifications are inherited under free nature we can have no standard of comparison by which to judge of the effects of long continued use or disuse for we know not the parent forms but many animals have structures which can be explained by the effects of disuse as professor owen has remarked there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot fly yet there are several in this state the logger headed duck of south america can only flap along the surface of the water and has its wings in nearly the same condition as the domestic aylesbury duck as the larger ground feeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger i believe that the nearly wingless condition of several birds which now inhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands tenanted by no beast of prey has been caused by disuse the ostrich indeed inhabits continents and is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape by flight but by kicking it can defend itself from enemies as well as any of the smaller 135 quadrupeds we may imagine that the early progenitor of the ostrich had habits like those of a bustard and that as natural selection increased in successive generations the size and weight of its body its legs were used more and its wings less until they became incapable of flight kirby has remarked and i have observed the same fact that the anterior tarsi or feet of many male dung feeding beetles are very often broken off he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection and not one had even a relic left in the onites apelles the tarsi are so habitually lost that the insect has been described as not having them in some other genera they are present but in a rudimentary condition in the ateuchus or sacred beetle of the egyptians they are totally deficient there is not sufficient evidence to induce me to believe that mutilations are ever inherited and i should prefer explaining the entire absence of the anterior tarsi in ateuchus and their rudimentary condition in some other genera by the long continued effects of disuse in their progenitors for as the tarsi are almost always lost in many dung feeding beetles they must be lost early in life and therefore cannot be much used by these insects in some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications of structure which are wholly or mainly due to natural selection mr wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that 200 beetles out of the 550 species inhabiting madeira are so far deficient in wings that they cannot fly and that of the twenty nine endemic genera no less than twenty three genera have all their species in this condition several facts namely that beetles in many parts of the world are frequently blown to sea and perish that the beetles in madeira as observed by mr wollaston lie much concealed 136 until the wind lulls and the sun shines that the proportion of wingless beetles is larger on the exposed desertas than in madeira itself and especially the extraordinary fact so strongly insisted on by mr wollaston of the almost entire absence of certain large groups of beetles elsewhere excessively numerous and which groups have habits of life almost necessitating frequent flight these several considerations have made me believe that the wingless condition of so many madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of natural selection but combined probably with disuse for during thousands of successive generations each individual beetle which flew least either from its wings having been ever so little less perfectly developed or from indolent habit will have had the best chance of surviving from not being blown out to sea and on the other hand those beetles which most readily took to flight would oftenest have been blown to sea and thus have been destroyed the insects in madeira which are not ground feeders and which as the flower feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera must habitually use their wings to gain their subsistence have as mr wollaston suspects their wings not at all reduced but even enlarged this is quite compatible with the action of natural selection for when a new insect first arrived on the island the tendency of natural selection to enlarge or to reduce the wings would depend on whether a greater number of individuals were saved by successfully battling with the winds or by giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying as with mariners shipwrecked near a coast it would have been better for the good swimmers if they had been able to swim still further whereas it would have been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swim at all and had stuck to the wreck 137 the eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size and in some cases are quite covered up by skin and fur this state of the eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse but aided perhaps by natural selection in south america a burrowing rodent the tuco tuco or ctenomys is even more subterranean in its habits than the mole and i was assured by a spaniard who had often caught them that they were frequently blind one which i kept alive was certainly in this condition the cause as appeared on dissection having been inflammation of the nictitating membrane as frequent inflammation of the eyes must be injurious to any animal and as eyes are certainly not indispensable to animals with subterranean habits a reduction in their size with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them might in such case be an advantage and if so natural selection would constantly aid the effects of disuse it is well known that several animals belonging to the most different classes which inhabit the caves of styria and of kentucky are blind in some of the crabs the foot stalk for the eye remains though the eye is gone the stand for the telescope is there though the telescope with its glasses has been lost as it is difficult to imagine that eyes though useless could be in any way injurious to animals living in darkness i attribute their loss wholly to disuse in one of the blind animals namely the cave rat the eyes are of immense size and professor silliman thought that it regained after living some days in the light some slight power of vision in the same manner as in madeira the wings of some of the insects have been enlarged and the wings of others have been reduced by natural selection aided by use and disuse so in the case of the cave rat natural selection seems to have struggled with the loss of light and 138 to have increased the size of the eyes whereas with all the other inhabitants of the caves disuse by itself seems to have done its work it is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deep limestone caverns under a nearly similar climate so that on the common view of the blind animals having been separately created for the american and european caverns close similarity in their organisation and affinities might have been expected but as schiг dte and others have remarked this is not the case and the cave insects of the two continents are not more closely allied than might have been anticipated from the general resemblance of the other inhabitants of north america and europe on my view we must suppose that american animals having ordinary powers of vision slowly migrated by successive generations from the outer world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the kentucky caves as did european animals into the caves of europe we have some evidence of this gradation of habit for as schiг dte remarks animals not far remote from ordinary forms prepare the transition from light to darkness next follow those that are constructed for twilight and last of all those destined for total darkness by the time that an animal had reached after numberless generations the deepest recesses disuse will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes and natural selection will often have effected other changes such as an increase in the length of the antennг or palpi as a compensation for blindness notwithstanding such modifications we might expect still to see in the cave animals of america affinities to the other inhabitants of that continent and in those of europe to the inhabitants of the european continent and this is the case with some of the american cave animals as i hear from 139 professor dana and some of the european cave insects are very closely allied to those of the surrounding country it would be most difficult to give any rational explanation of the affinities of the blind cave animals to the other inhabitants of the two continents on the ordinary view of their independent creation that several of the inhabitants of the caves of the old and new worlds should be closely related we might expect from the well known relationship of most of their other productions far from feeling any surprise that some of the cave animals should be very anomalous as agassiz has remarked in regard to the blind fish the amblyopsis and as is the case with the blind proteus with reference to the reptiles of europe i am only surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved owing to the less severe competition to which the inhabitants of these dark abodes will probably have been exposed acclimatisation habit is hereditary with plants as in the period of flowering in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate in the time of sleep c and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation as it is extremely common for species of the same genus to inhabit very hot and very cold countries and as i believe that all the species of the same genus have descended from a single parent if this view be correct acclimatisation must be readily effected during long continued descent it is notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its own home species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannot endure a tropical climate or conversely so again many succulent plants cannot endure a damp climate but the degree of adaptation of species to the climates under which they live is often overrated 140 we may infer this from our frequent inability to predict whether or not an imported plant will endure our climate and from the number of plants and animals brought from warmer countries which here enjoy good health we have reason to believe that species in a state of nature are limited in their ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite as much as or more than by adaptation to particular climates but whether or not the adaptation be generally very close we have evidence in the case of some few plants of their becoming to a certain extent naturally habituated to different temperatures or becoming acclimatised thus the pines and rhododendrons raised from seed collected by dr hooker from trees growing at different heights on the himalaya were found in this country to possess different constitutional powers of resisting cold mr thwaites informs me that he has observed similar facts in ceylon and analogous observations have been made by mr h c watson on european species of plants brought from the azores to england in regard to animals several authentic cases could be given of species within historical times having largely extended their range from warmer to cooler latitudes and conversely but we do not positively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native climate but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case nor do we know that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their new homes as i believe that our domestic animals were originally chosen by uncivilised man because they were useful and bred readily under confinement and not because they were subsequently found capable of far extended transportation i think the common and extraordinary capacity in our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different climates but of being perfectly 141 fertile a far severer test under them may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other animals now in a state of nature could easily be brought to bear widely different climates we must not however push the foregoing argument too far on account of the probable origin of some of our domestic animals from several wild stocks the blood for instance of a tropical and arctic wolf or wild dog may perhaps be mingled in our domestic breeds the rat and mouse cannot be considered as domestic animals but they have been transported by man to many parts of the world and now have a far wider range than any other rodent living free under the cold climate of faroe in the north and of the falklands in the south and on many islands in the torrid zones hence i am inclined to look at adaptation to any special climate as a quality readily grafted on an innate wide flexibility of constitution which is common to most animals on this view the capacity of enduring the most different climates by man himself and by his domestic animals and such facts as that former species of the elephant and rhinoceros were capable of enduring a glacial climate whereas the living species are now all tropical or sub tropical in their habits ought not to be looked at as anomalies but merely as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution brought under peculiar circumstances into play how much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate is due to mere habit and how much to the natural selection of varieties having different innate constitutions and how much to both means combined is a very obscure question that habit or custom has some influence i must believe both from analogy and from the incessant advice given in agricultural works even in the ancient encyclopг dias of china to be very 142 cautious in transposing animals from one district to another for it is not likely that man should have succeeded in selecting so many breeds and sub breeds with constitutions specially fitted for their own districts the result must i think be due to habit on the other hand i can see no reason to doubt that natural selection will continually tend to preserve those individuals which are born with constitutions best adapted to their native countries in treatises on many kinds of cultivated plants certain varieties are said to withstand certain climates better than others this is very strikingly shown in works on fruit trees published in the united states in which certain varieties are habitually recommended for the northern and others for the southern states and as most of these varieties are of recent origin they cannot owe their constitutional differences to habit the case of the jerusalem artichoke which is never propagated by seed and of which consequently new varieties have not been produced has even been advanced for it is now as tender as ever it was as proving that acclimatisation cannot be effected the case also of the kidney bean has been often cited for a similar purpose and with much greater weight but until some one will sow during a score of generations his kidney beans so early that a very large proportion are destroyed by frost and then collect seed from the few survivors with care to prevent accidental crosses and then again get seed from these seedlings with the same precautions the experiment cannot be said to have been even tried nor let it be supposed that no differences in the constitution of seedling kidney beans ever appear for an account has been published how much more hardy some seedlings appeared to be than others on the whole i think we may conclude that habit 143 use and disuse have in some cases played a considerable part in the modification of the constitution and of the structure of various organs but that the effects of use and disuse have often been largely combined with and sometimes overmastered by the natural selection of innate variations correlation of growth i mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tied together during its growth and development that when slight variations in any one part occur and are accumulated through natural selection other parts become modified this is a very important subject most imperfectly understood the most obvious case is that modifications accumulated solely for the good of the young or larva will it may safely be concluded affect the structure of the adult in the same manner as any malconformation affecting the early embryo seriously affects the whole organisation of the adult the several parts of the body which are homologous and which at an early embryonic period are alike seem liable to vary in an allied manner we see this in the right and left sides of the body varying in the same manner in the front and hind legs and even in the jaws and limbs varying together for the lower jaw is believed to be homologous with the limbs these tendencies i do not doubt may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side and if this had been of any great use to the breed it might probably have been rendered permanent by natural selection homologous parts as has been remarked by some authors tend to cohere this is often seen in monstrous plants and nothing is more common than the union of homologous parts in normal structures as the union of 144 the petals of the corolla into a tube hard parts seem to affect the form of adjoining soft parts it is believed by some authors that the diversity in the shape of the pelvis in birds causes the remarkable diversity in the shape of their kidneys others believe that the shape of the pelvis in the human mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of the child in snakes according to schlegel the shape of the body and the manner of swallowing determine the position of several of the most important viscera the nature of the bond of correlation is very frequently quite obscure m is geoffroy st hilaire has forcibly remarked that certain malconformations very frequently and that others rarely coexist without our being able to assign any reason what can be more singular than the relation between blue eyes and deafness in cats and the tortoise shell colour with the female sex the feathered feet and skin between the outer toes in pigeons and the presence of more or less down on the young birds when first hatched with the future colour of their plumage or again the relation between the hair and teeth in the naked turkish dog though here probably homology comes into play with respect to this latter case of correlation i think it can hardly be accidental that if we pick out the two orders of mammalia which are most abnormal in their dermal covering viz cetacea whales and edentata armadilloes scaly anteaters c that these are likewise the most abnormal in their teeth i know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of correlation in modifying important structures independently of utility and therefore of natural selection than that of the difference between the outer and inner flowers in some compositous and umbelliferous plants every one knows the 145 difference in the ray and central florets of for instance the daisy and this difference is often accompanied with the abortion of parts of the flower but in some compositous plants the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture and even the ovary itself with its accessory parts differs as has been described by cassini these differences have been attributed by some authors to pressure and the shape of the seeds in the ray florets in some compositг countenances this idea but in the case of the corolla of the umbelliferг it is by no means as dr hooker informs me in species with the densest heads that the inner and outer flowers most frequently differ it might have been thought that the development of the ray petals by drawing nourishment from certain other parts of the flower had caused their abortion but in some compositг there is a difference in the seeds of the outer and inner florets without any difference in the corolla possibly these several differences may be connected with some difference in the flow of nutriment towards the central and external flowers we know at least that in irregular flowers those nearest to the axis are oftenest subject to peloria and become regular i may add as an instance of this and of a striking case of correlation that i have recently observed in some garden pelargoniums that the central flower of the truss often loses the patches of darker colour in the two upper petals and that when this occurs the adherent nectary is quite aborted when the colour is absent from only one of the two upper petals the nectary is only much shortened with respect to the difference in the corolla of the central and exterior flowers of a head or umbel i do not feel at all sure that c c sprengel s idea that the ray florets serve to attract insects whose agency is highly advantageous in the fertilisation of plants of 146 these two orders is so far fetched as it may at first appear and if it be advantageous natural selection may have come into play but in regard to the differences both in the internal and external structure of the seeds which are not always correlated with any differences in the flowers it seems impossible that they can be in any way advantageous to the plant yet in the umbelliferг these differences are of such apparent importance the seeds being in some cases according to tausch orthospermous in the exterior flowers and coelospermous in the central flowers that the elder de candolle founded his main divisions of the order on analogous differences hence we see that modifications of structure viewed by systematists as of high value may be wholly due to unknown laws of correlated growth and without being as far as we can see of the slightest service to the species we may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth structures which are common to whole groups of species and which in truth are simply due to inheritance for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural selection some one modification in structure and after thousands of generations some other and independent modification and these two modifications having been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with diverse habits would naturally be thought to be correlated in some necessary manner so again i do not doubt that some apparent correlations occurring throughout whole orders are entirely due to the manner alone in which natural selection can act for instance alph de candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do not open i should explain the rule by the fact that seeds could not gradually become winged through natural selection except in fruits which opened so that the individual plants producing 147 seeds which were a little better fitted to be wafted further might get an advantage over those producing seed less fitted for dispersal and this process could not possibly go on in fruit which did not open the elder geoffroy and goethe propounded at about the same period their law of compensation or balancement of growth or as goethe expressed it in order to spend on one side nature is forced to economise on the other side i think this holds true to a certain extent with our domestic productions if nourishment flows to one part or organ in excess it rarely flows at least in excess to another part thus it is difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten readily the same varieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant and nutritious foliage and a copious supply of oil bearing seeds when the seeds in our fruits become atrophied the fruit itself gains largely in size and quality in our poultry a large tuft of feathers on the head is generally accompanied by a diminished comb and a large beard by diminished wattles with species in a state of nature it can hardly be maintained that the law is of universal application but many good observers more especially botanists believe in its truth i will not however here give any instances for i see hardly any way of distinguishing between the effects on the one hand of a part being largely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining part being reduced by this same process or by disuse and on the other hand the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of growth in another and adjoining part i suspect also that some of the cases of compensation which have been advanced and likewise some other facts may be merged under a more general principle namely that natural selection is continually trying to economise in every part of the organisation if under 148 changed conditions of life a structure before useful becomes less useful any diminution however slight in its development will be seized on by natural selection for it will profit the individual not to have its nutriment wasted in building up an useless structure i can thus only understand a fact with which i was much struck when examining cirripedes and of which many other instances could be given namely that when a cirripede is parasitic within another and is thus protected it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace this is the case with the male ibla and in a truly extraordinary manner with the proteolepas for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists of the three highly important anterior segments of the head enormously developed and furnished with great nerves and muscles but in the parasitic and protected proteolepas the whole anterior part of the head is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the prehensile antennг now the saving of a large and complex structure when rendered superfluous by the parasitic habits of the proteolepas though effected by slow steps would be a decided advantage to each successive individual of the species for in the struggle for life to which every animal is exposed each individual proteolepas would have a better chance of supporting itself by less nutriment being wasted in developing a structure now become useless thus as i believe natural selection will always succeed in the long run in reducing and saving every part of the organisation as soon as it is rendered superfluous without by any means causing some other part to be largely developed in a corresponding degree and conversely that natural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing any organ without requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction of some adjoining part 149 it seems to be a rule as remarked by is geoffroy st hilaire both in varieties and in species that when any part or organ is repeated many times in the structure of the same individual as the vertebrг in snakes and the stamens in polyandrous flowers the number is variable whereas the number of the same part or organ when it occurs in lesser numbers is constant the same author and some botanists have further remarked that multiple parts are also very liable to variation in structure inasmuch as this vegetative repetition to use prof owen s expression seems to be a sign of low organisation the foregoing remark seems connected with the very general opinion of naturalists that beings low in the scale of nature are more variable than those which are higher i presume that lowness in this case means that the several parts of the organisation have been but little specialised for particular functions and as long as the same part has to perform diversified work we can perhaps see why it should remain variable that is why natural selection should have preserved or rejected each little deviation of form less carefully than when the part has to serve for one special purpose alone in the same way that a knife which has to cut all sorts of things may be of almost any shape whilst a tool for some particular object had better be of some particular shape natural selection it should never be forgotten can act on each part of each being solely through and for its advantage rudimentary parts it has been stated by some authors and i believe with truth are apt to be highly variable we shall have to recur to the general subject of rudimentary and aborted organs and i will here only add that their variability seems to be owing to their uselessness and therefore to natural selection having no power to check deviations in their structure thus 150 rudimentary parts are left to the free play of the various laws of growth to the effects of long continued disuse and to the tendency to reversion a part developed in any species in an extraordinary degree or manner in comparison with the same part in allied species tends to be highly variable several years ago i was much struck with a remark nearly to the above effect published by mr waterhouse i infer also from an observation made by professor owen with respect to the length of the arms of the ourang outang that he has come to a nearly similar conclusion it is hopeless to attempt to convince any one of the truth of this proposition without giving the long array of facts which i have collected and which cannot possibly be here introduced i can only state my conviction that it is a rule of high generality i am aware of several causes of error but i hope that i have made due allowance for them it should be understood that the rule by no means applies to any part however unusually developed unless it be unusually developed in comparison with the same part in closely allied species thus the bat s wing is a most abnormal structure in the class mammalia but the rule would not here apply because there is a whole group of bats having wings it would apply only if some one species of bat had its wings developed in some remarkable manner in comparison with the other species of the same genus the rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary sexual characters when displayed in any unusual manner the term secondary sexual characters used by hunter applies to characters which are attached to one sex but are not directly connected with the act of reproduction the rule applies to males and females but as females more rarely offer remarkable secondary sexual characters it applies 151 more rarely to them the rule being so plainly applicable in the case of secondary sexual characters may be due to the great variability of these characters whether or not displayed in any unusual manner of which fact i think there can be little doubt but that our rule is not confined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the case of hermaphrodite cirripedes and i may here add that i particularly attended to mr waterhouse s remark whilst investigating this order and i am fully convinced that the rule almost invariably holds good with cirripedes i shall in my future work give a list of the more remarkable cases i will here only briefly give one as it illustrates the rule in its largest application the opercular valves of sessile cirripedes rock barnacles are in every sense of the word very important structures and they differ extremely little even in different genera but in the several species of one genus pyrgoma these valves present a marvellous amount of diversification the homologous valves in the different species being sometimes wholly unlike in shape and the amount of variation in the individuals of several of the species is so great that it is no exaggeration to state that the varieties differ more from each other in the characters of these important valves than do other species of distinct genera as birds within the same country vary in a remarkably small degree i have particularly attended to them and the rule seems to me certainly to hold good in this class i cannot make out that it applies to plants and this would seriously have shaken my belief in its truth had not the great variability in plants made it particularly difficult to compare their relative degrees of variability when we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or manner in any species the fair 152 presumption is that it is of high importance to that species nevertheless the part in this case is eminently liable to variation why should this be so on the view that each species has been independently created with all its parts as we now see them i can see no explanation but on the view that groups of species have descended from other species and have been modified through natural selection i think we can obtain some light in our domestic animals if any part or the whole animal be neglected and no selection be applied that part for instance the comb in the dorking fowl or the whole breed will cease to have a nearly uniform character the breed will then be said to have degenerated in rudimentary organs and in those which have been but little specialised for any particular purpose and perhaps in polymorphic groups we see a nearly parallel natural case for in such cases natural selection either has not or cannot come into full play and thus the organisation is left in a fluctuating condition but what here more especially concerns us is that in our domestic animals those points which at the present time are undergoing rapid change by continued selection are also eminently liable to variation look at the breeds of the pigeon see what a prodigious amount of difference there is in the beak of the different tumblers in the beak and wattle of the different carriers in the carriage and tail of our fantails c these being the points now mainly attended to by english fanciers even in the sub breeds as in the short faced tumbler it is notoriously difficult to breed them nearly to perfection and frequently individuals are born which depart widely from the standard there may be truly said to be a constant struggle going on between on the one hand the tendency to reversion to a less modified state as well as an innate tendency to further 153 variability of all kinds and on the other hand the power of steady selection to keep the breed true in the long run selection gains the day and we do not expect to fail so far as to breed a bird as coarse as a common tumbler from a good short faced strain but as long as selection is rapidly going on there may always be expected to be much variability in the structure undergoing modification it further deserves notice that these variable characters produced by man s selection sometimes become attached from causes quite unknown to us more to one sex than to the other generally to the male sex as with the wattle of carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters now let us turn to nature when a part has been developed in an extraordinary manner in any one species compared with the other species of the same genus we may conclude that this part has undergone an extraordinary amount of modification since the period when the species branched off from the common progenitor of the genus this period will seldom be remote in any extreme degree as species very rarely endure for more than one geological period an extraordinary amount of modification implies an unusually large and long continued amount of variability which has continually been accumulated by natural selection for the benefit of the species but as the variability of the extraordinarily developed part or organ has been so great and long continued within a period not excessively remote we might as a general rule expect still to find more variability in such parts than in other parts of the organisation which have remained for a much longer period nearly constant and this i am convinced is the case that the struggle between natural selection on the one hand and the tendency to reversion and variability on the other hand will in the 154 course of time cease and that the most abnormally developed organs may be made constant i can see no reason to doubt hence when an organ however abnormal it may be has been transmitted in approximately the same condition to many modified descendants as in the case of the wing of the bat it must have existed according to my theory for an immense period in nearly the same state and thus it comes to be no more variable than any other structure it is only in those cases in which the modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily great that we ought to find the generative variability as it may be called still present in a high degree for in this case the variability will seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of the individuals varying in the required manner and degree and by the continued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and less modified condition the principle included in these remarks may be extended it is notorious that specific characters are more variable than generic to explain by a simple example what is meant if some species in a large genus of plants had blue flowers and some had red the colour would be only a specific character and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species varying into red or conversely but if all the species had blue flowers the colour would become a generic character and its variation would be a more unusual circumstance i have chosen this example because an explanation is not in this case applicable which most naturalists would advance namely that specific characters are more variable than generic because they are taken from parts of less physiological importance than those commonly used for classing genera i believe this explanation is partly yet only indirectly true i shall however have to 155 return to this subject in our chapter on classification it would be almost superfluous to adduce evidence in support of the above statement that specific characters are more variable than generic but i have repeatedly noticed in works on natural history that when an author has remarked with surprise that some important organ or part which is generally very constant throughout large groups of species has differed considerably in closely allied species that it has also been variable in the individuals of some of the species and this fact shows that a character which is generally of generic value when it sinks in value and becomes only of specific value often becomes variable though its physiological importance may remain the same something of the same kind applies to monstrosities at least is geoffroy st hilaire seems to entertain no doubt that the more an organ normally differs in the different species of the same group the more subject it is to individual anomalies on the ordinary view of each species having been independently created why should that part of the structure which differs from the same part in other independently created species of the same genus be more variable than those parts which are closely alike in the several species i do not see that any explanation can be given but on the view of species being only strongly marked and fixed varieties we might surely expect to find them still often continuing to vary in those parts of their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period and which have thus come to differ or to state the case in another manner the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each other and in which they differ from the species of some other genus are called generic characters and these characters in common i attribute to 156 inheritance from a common progenitor for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will have modified several species fitted to more or less widely different habits in exactly the same manner and as these so called generic characters have been inherited from a remote period since that period when the species first branched off from their common progenitor and subsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree or only in a slight degree it is not probable that they should vary at the present day on the other hand the points in which species differ from other species of the same genus are called specific characters and as these specific characters have varied and come to differ within the period of the branching off of the species from a common progenitor it is probable that they should still often be in some degree variable at least more variable than those parts of the organisation which have for a very long period remained constant in connexion with the present subject i will make only two other remarks i think it will be admitted without my entering on details that secondary sexual characters are very variable i think it also will be admitted that species of the same group differ from each other more widely in their secondary sexual characters than in other parts of their organisation compare for instance the amount of difference between the males of gallinaceous birds in which secondary sexual characters are strongly displayed with the amount of difference between their females and the truth of this proposition will be granted the cause of the original variability of secondary sexual characters is not manifest but we can see why these characters should not have been rendered as constant and uniform as other parts of the organisation for secondary sexual characters have been accumulated by sexual selection which 157 is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection as it does not entail death but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured males whatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexual characters as they are highly variable sexual selection will have had a wide scope for action and may thus readily have succeeded in giving to the species of the same group a greater amount of difference in their sexual characters than in other parts of their structure it is a remarkable fact that the secondary sexual differences between the two sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the very same parts of the organisation in which the different species of the same genus differ from each other of this fact i will give in illustration two instances the first which happen to stand on my list and as the differences in these cases are of a very unusual nature the relation can hardly be accidental the same number of joints in the tarsi is a character generally common to very large groups of beetles but in the engidг as westwood has remarked the number varies greatly and the number likewise differs in the two sexes of the same species again in fossorial hymenoptera the manner of neuration of the wings is a character of the highest importance because common to large groups but in certain genera the neuration differs in the different species and likewise in the two sexes of the same species this relation has a clear meaning on my view of the subject i look at all the species of the same genus as having as certainly descended from the same progenitor as have the two sexes of any one of the species consequently whatever part of the structure of the common progenitor or of its early descendants became variable variations of this part would it is highly probable be taken advantage of by natural and sexual selection in order to fit 158 the several species to their several places in the economy of nature and likewise to fit the two sexes of the same species to each other or to fit the males and females to different habits of life or the males to struggle with other males for the possession of the females finally then i conclude that the greater variability of specific characters or those which distinguish species from species than of generic characters or those which the species possess in common that the frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in a species in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part in its congeners and the slight degree of variability in a part however extraordinarily it may be developed if it be common to a whole group of species that the great variability of secondary sexual characters and the great amount of difference in these same characters between closely allied species that secondary sexual and ordinary specific differences are generally displayed in the same parts of the organisation are all principles closely connected together all being mainly due to the species of the same group having descended from a common progenitor from whom they have inherited much in common to parts which have recently and largely varied being more likely still to go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and have not varied to natural selection having more or less completely according to the lapse of time overmastered the tendency to reversion and to further variability to sexual selection being less rigid than ordinary selection and to variations in the same parts having been accumulated by natural and sexual selection and having been thus adapted for secondary sexual and for ordinary specific purposes 159 distinct species present analogous variations and a variety of one species often assumes some of the characters of an allied species or reverts to some of the characters of an early progenitor these propositions will be most readily understood by looking to our domestic races the most distinct breeds of pigeons in countries most widely apart present sub varieties with reversed feathers on the head and feathers on the feet characters not possessed by the aboriginal rock pigeon these then are analogous variations in two or more distinct races the frequent presence of fourteen or even sixteen tail feathers in the pouter may be considered as a variation representing the normal structure of another race the fantail i presume that no one will doubt that all such analogous variations are due to the several races of the pigeon having inherited from a common parent the same constitution and tendency to variation when acted on by similar unknown influences in the vegetable kingdom we have a case of analogous variation in the enlarged stems or roots as commonly called of the swedish turnip and ruta baga plants which several botanists tank as varieties produced by cultivation from a common parent if this be not so the case will then be one of analogous variation in two so called distinct species and to these a third may be added namely the common turnip according to the ordinary view of each species having been independently created we should have to attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems of these three plants not to the vera causa of community of descent and a consequent tendency to vary in a like manner but to three separate yet closely related acts of creation with pigeons however we have another case namely the occasional appearance in all the breeds of slaty blue birds with two black bars on the wings a white 160 rump a bar at the end of the tail with the outer feathers externally edged near their bases with white as all these marks are characteristic of the parent rock pigeon i presume that no one will doubt that this is a case of reversion and not of a new yet analogous variation appearing in the several breeds we may i think confidently come to this conclusion because as we have seen these coloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct and differently coloured breeds and in this case there is nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the slaty blue with the several marks beyond the influence of the mere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance no doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappear after having been lost for many perhaps for hundreds of generations but when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed the offspring occasionally show a tendency to revert in character to the foreign breed for many generations some say for a dozen or even a score of generations after twelve generations the proportion of blood to use a common expression of any one ancestor is only 1 in 2048 and yet as we see it is generally believed that a tendency to reversion is retained by this very small proportion of foreign blood in a breed which has not been crossed but in which both parents have lost some character which their progenitor possessed the tendency whether strong or weak to reproduce the lost character might be as was formerly remarked for all that we can see to the contrary transmitted for almost any number of generations when a character which has been lost in a breed reappears after a great number of generations the most probable hypothesis is not that the offspring suddenly takes after an ancestor some hundred generations 161 distant but that in each successive generation there has been a tendency to reproduce the character in question which at last under unknown favourable conditions gains an ascendancy for instance it is probable that in each generation of the barb pigeon which produces most rarely a blue and black barred bird there has been a tendency in each generation in the plumage to assume this colour this view is hypothetical but could be supported by some facts and i can see no more abstract improbability in a tendency to produce any character being inherited for an endless number of generations than in quite useless or rudimentary organs being as we all know them to be thus inherited indeed we may sometimes observe a mere tendency to produce a rudiment inherited for instance in the common snapdragon antirrhinum a rudiment of a fifth stamen so often appears that this plant must have an inherited tendency to produce it as all the species of the same genus are supposed on my theory to have descended from a common parent it might be expected that they would occasionally vary in an analogous manner so that a variety of one species would resemble in some of its characters another species this other species being on my view only a well marked and permanent variety but characters thus gained would probably be of an unimportant nature for the presence of all important characters will be governed by natural selection in accordance with the diverse habits of the species and will not be left to the mutual action of the conditions of life and of a similar inherited constitution it might further be expected that the species of the same genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to lost ancestral characters as however we never know the exact character of the common ancestor of a group we could not distinguish these two 162 cases if for instance we did not know that the rock pigeon was not feather footed or turn crowned we could not have told whether these characters in our domestic breeds were reversions or only analogous variations but we might have inferred that the blueness was a case of reversion from the number of the markings which are correlated with the blue tint and which it does not appear probable would all appear together from simple variation more especially we might have inferred this from the blue colour and marks so often appearing when distinct breeds of diverse colours are crossed hence though under nature it must generally be left doubtful what cases are reversions to an anciently existing character and what are new but analogous variations yet we ought on my theory sometimes to find the varying offspring of a species assuming characters either from reversion or from analogous variation which already occur in some other members of the same group and this undoubtedly is the case in nature a considerable part of the difficulty in recognising a variable species in our systematic works is due to its varieties mocking as it were some of the other species of the same genus a considerable catalogue also could be given of forms intermediate between two other forms which themselves must be doubtfully ranked as either varieties or species and this shows unless all these forms be considered as independently created species that the one in varying has assumed some of the characters of the other so as to produce the intermediate form but the best evidence is afforded by parts or organs of an important and uniform nature occasionally varying so as to acquire in some degree the character of the same part or organ in an allied species i have collected a long list of such cases but 163 here as before i lie under a great disadvantage in not being able to give them i can only repeat that such cases certainly do occur and seem to me very remarkable i will however give one curious and complex case not indeed as affecting any important character but from occurring in several species of the same genus partly under domestication and partly under nature it is a case apparently of reversion the ass not rarely has very distinct transverse bars on its legs like those on the legs of the zebra it has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal and from inquiries which i have made i believe this to be true it has also been asserted that the stripe on each shoulder is sometimes double the shoulder stripe is certainly very variable in length and outline a white ass but not an albino has been described without either spinal or shoulder stripe and these stripes are sometimes very obscure or actually quite lost in dark coloured asses the koulan of pallas is said to have been seen with a double shoulder stripe the hemionus has no shoulder stripe but traces of it as stated by mr blyth and others occasionally appear and i have been informed by colonel poole that the foals of this species are generally striped on the legs and faintly on the shoulder the quagga though so plainly barred like a zebra over the body is without bars on the legs but dr gray has figured one specimen with very distinct zebra like bars on the hocks with respect to the horse i have collected cases in england of the spinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds and of all colours transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns mouse duns and in one instance in a chestnut a faint shoulder stripe may sometimes be seen in duns and i have seen a trace in a 164 bay horse my son made a careful examination and sketch for me of a dun belgian cart horse with a double stripe on each shoulder and with leg stripes and a man whom i can implicitly trust has examined for me a small dun welch pony with three short parallel stripes on each shoulder in the north west part of india the kattywar breed of horses is so generally striped that as i hear from colonel poole who examined the breed for the indian government a horse without stripes is not considered as purely bred the spine is always striped the legs are generally barred and the shoulder stripe which is sometimes double and sometimes treble is common the side of the face moreover is sometimes striped the stripes are plainest in the foal and sometimes quite disappear in old horses colonel poole has seen both gray and bay kattywar horses striped when first foaled i have also reason to suspect from information given me by mr w w edwards that with the english racehorse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the foal than in the full grown animal without here entering on further details i may state that i have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes in horses of very different breeds in various countries from britain to eastern china and from norway in the north to the malay archipelago in the south in all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenest in duns and mouse duns by the term dun a large range of colour is included from one between brown and black to a close approach to cream colour i am aware that colonel hamilton smith who has written on this subject believes that the several breeds of the horse have descended from several aboriginal species one of which the dun was striped and that the above described appearances are all due to ancient 165 crosses with the dun stock but i am not at all satisfied with this theory and should be loth to apply it to breeds so distinct as the heavy belgian cart horse welch ponies cobs the lanky kattywar race c inhabiting the most distant parts of the world now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of the horse genus rollin asserts that the common mule from the ass and horse is particularly apt to have bars on its legs according to mr gosse in certain parts of the united states about nine out of ten mules have striped legs i once saw a mule with its legs so much striped that any one would at first have thought that it must have been the product of a zebra and mr w c martin in his excellent treatise on the horse has given a figure of a similar mule in four coloured drawings which i have seen of hybrids between the ass and zebra the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest of the body and in one of them there was a double shoulder stripe in lord morton s famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga the hybrid and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mare by a black arabian sire were much more plainly barred across the legs than is even the pure quagga lastly and this is another most remarkable case a hybrid has been figured by dr gray and he informs me that he knows of a second case from the ass and the hemionus and this hybrid though the ass seldom has stripes on his legs and the hemionus has none and has not even a shoulder stripe nevertheless had all four legs barred and had three short shoulder stripes like those on the dun welch pony and even had some zebra like stripes on the sides of its face with respect to this last fact i was so convinced that not even a stripe of colour appears from what would commonly be called an 166 accident that i was led solely from the occurrence of the face stripes on this hybrid from the ass and hemionus to ask colonel poole whether such face stripes ever occur in the eminently striped kattywar breed of horses and was as we have seen answered in the affirmative what now are we to say to these several facts we see several very distinct species of the horse genus becoming by simple variation striped on the legs like a zebra or striped on the shoulders like an ass in the horse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tint appears a tint which approaches to that of the general colouring of the other species of the genus the appearance of the stripes is not accompanied by any change of form or by any other new character we see this tendency to become striped most strongly displayed in hybrids from between several of the most distinct species now observe the case of the several breeds of pigeons they are descended from a pigeon including two or three sub species or geographical races of a bluish colour with certain bars and other marks and when any breed assumes by simple variation a bluish tint these bars and other marks invariably reappear but without any other change of form or character when the oldest and truest breeds of various colours are crossed we see a strong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to reappear in the mongrels i have stated that the most probable hypothesis to account for the reappearance of very ancient characters is that there is a tendency in the young of each successive generation to produce the long lost character and that this tendency from unknown causes sometimes prevails and we have just seen that in several species of the horse genus the stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly in the young than in the old call the breeds of pigeons some of which have bred true for 167 centuries species and how exactly parallel is the case with that of the species of the horse genus for myself i venture confidently to look back thousands on thousands of generations and i see an animal striped like a zebra but perhaps otherwise very differently constructed the common parent of our domestic horse whether or not it be descended from one or more wild stocks of the ass the hemionus quagga and zebra he who believes that each equine species was independently created will i presume assert that each species has been created with a tendency to vary both under nature and under domestication in this particular manner so as often to become striped like other species of the genus and that each has been created with a strong tendency when crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world to produce hybrids resembling in their stripes not their own parents but other species of the genus to admit this view is as it seems to me to reject a real for an unreal or at least for an unknown cause it makes the works of god a mere mockery and deception i would almost as soon believe with the old and ignorant cosmogonists that fossil shells had never lived but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells now living on the sea shore summary our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound not in one case out of a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that part differs more or less from the same part in the parents but whenever we have the means of instituting a comparison the same laws appear to have acted in producing the lesser differences between varieties of the same species and the greater differences between species of the same genus the external conditions of life as 168 climate and food c seem to have induced some slight modifications habit in producing constitutional differences and use in strengthening and disuse in weakening and diminishing organs seem to have been more potent in their effects homologous parts tend to vary in the same way and homologous parts tend to cohere modifications in hard parts and in external parts sometimes affect softer and internal parts when one part is largely developed perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from the adjoining parts and every part of the structure which can be saved without detriment to the individual will be saved changes of structure at an early age will generally affect parts subsequently developed and there are very many other correlations of growth the nature of which we are utterly unable to understand multiple parts are variable in number and in structure perhaps arising from such parts not having been closely specialised to any particular function so that their modifications have not been closely checked by natural selection it is probably from this same cause that organic beings low in the scale of nature are more variable than those which have their whole organisation more specialised and are higher in the scale rudimentary organs from being useless will be disregarded by natural selection and hence probably are variable specific characters that is the characters which have come to differ since the several species of the same genus branched off from a common parent are more variable than generic characters or those which have long been inherited and have not differed within this same period in these remarks we have referred to special parts or organs being still variable because they have recently varied and thus come to differ but we have also seen in the second chapter that the same principle applies to the whole individual 169 for in a district where many species of any genus are found that is where there has been much former variation and differentiation or where the manufactory of new specific forms has been actively at work there on an average we now find most varieties or incipient species secondary sexual characters are highly variable and such characters differ much in the species of the same group variability in the same parts of the organisation has generally been taken advantage of in giving secondary sexual differences to the sexes of the same species and specific differences to the several species of the same genus any part or organ developed to an extraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same part or organ in the allied species must have gone through an extraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose and thus we can understand why it should often still be variable in a much higher degree than other parts for variation is a long continued and slow process and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have had time to overcome the tendency to further variability and to reversion to a less modified state but when a species with any extraordinarily developed organ has become the parent of many modified descendants which on my view must be a very slow process requiring a long lapse of time in this case natural selection may readily have succeeded in giving a fixed character to the organ in however extraordinary a manner it may be developed species inheriting nearly the same constitution from a common parent and exposed to similar influences will naturally tend to present analogous variations and these same species may occasionally revert to some of the characters of their ancient progenitors although new and important modifications may not arise from reversion and analogous 170 variation such modifications will add to the beautiful and harmonious diversity of nature whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspring from their parents and a cause for each must exist it is the steady accumulation through natural selection of such differences when beneficial to the individual that gives rise to all the more important modifications of structure by which the innumerable beings on the face of this earth are enabled to struggle with each other and the best adapted to survive 171 chapter vi difficulties on theory difficulties on the theory of descent with modification transitions absence or rarity of transitional varieties transitions in habits of life diversified habits in the same species species with habits widely different from those of their allies organs of extreme perfection means of transition cases of difficulty natura non facit saltum organs of small importance organs not in all cases absolutely perfect the law of unity of type and of the conditions of existence embraced by the theory of natural selection long before having arrived at this part of my work a crowd of difficulties will have occurred to the reader some of them are so grave that to this day i can never reflect on them without being staggered but to the best of my judgment the greater number are only apparent and those that are real are not i think fatal to my theory these difficulties and objections may be classed under the following heads firstly why if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms why is not all nature in confusion instead of the species being as we see them well defined secondly is it possible that an animal having for instance the structure and habits of a bat could have been formed by the modification of some animal with wholly different habits can we believe that natural selection could produce on the one hand organs of trifling importance such as the tail of a giraffe which serves as a fly flapper and on the other hand organs of 172 such wonderful structure as the eye of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitable perfection thirdly can instincts be acquired and modified through natural selection what shall we say to so marvellous an instinct as that which leads the bee to make cells which has practically anticipated the discoveries of profound mathematicians fourthly how can we account for species when crossed being sterile and producing sterile offspring whereas when varieties are crossed their fertility is unimpaired the two first heads shall be here discussed instinct and hybridism in separate chapters on the absence or rarity of transitional varieties as natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications each new form will tend in a fully stocked country to take the place of and finally to exterminate its own less improved parent or other less favoured forms with which it comes into competition thus extinction and natural selection will as we have seen go hand in hand hence if we look at each species as descended from some other unknown form both the parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very process of formation and perfection of the new form but as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust of the earth it will be much more convenient to discuss this question in the chapter on the imperfection of the geological record and i will here only state that i believe the answer mainly lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed the imperfection of the record being chiefly due to organic beings not inhabiting 173 profound depths of the sea and to their remains being embedded and preserved to a future age only in masses of sediment sufficiently thick and extensive to withstand an enormous amount of future degradation and such fossiliferous masses can be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the shallow bed of the sea whilst it slowly subsides these contingencies will concur only rarely and after enormously long intervals whilst the bed of the sea is stationary or is rising or when very little sediment is being deposited there will be blanks in our geological history the crust of the earth is a vast museum but the natural collections have been made only at intervals of time immensely remote but it may be urged that when several closely allied species inhabit the same territory we surely ought to find at the present time many transitional forms let us take a simple case in travelling from north to south over a continent we generally meet at successive intervals with closely allied or representative species evidently filling nearly the same place in the natural economy of the land these representative species often meet and interlock and as the one becomes rarer and rarer the other becomes more and more frequent till the one replaces the other but if we compare these species where they intermingle they are generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail of structure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each by my theory these allied species have descended from a common parent and during the process of modification each has become adapted to the conditions of life of its own region and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent and all the transitional varieties between its past and present states hence we ought not to expect at the 174 present time to meet with numerous transitional varieties in each region though they must have existed there and may be embedded there in a fossil condition but in the intermediate region having intermediate conditions of life why do we not now find closely linking intermediate varieties this difficulty for a long time quite confounded me but i think it can be in large part explained in the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring because an area is now continuous that it has been continuous during a long period geology would lead us to believe that almost every continent has been broken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods and in such islands distinct species might have been separately formed without the possibility of intermediate varieties existing in the intermediate zones by changes in the form of the land and of climate marine areas now continuous must often have existed within recent times in a far less continuous and uniform condition than at present but i will pass over this way of escaping from the difficulty for i believe that many perfectly defined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas though i do not doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas now continuous has played an important part in the formation of new species more especially with freely crossing and wandering animals in looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory then becoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines and finally disappearing hence the neutral territory between two representative species is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper to each we see the same fact in ascending mountains and sometimes 175 it is quite remarkable how abruptly as alph de candolle has observed a common alpine species disappears the same fact has been noticed by e forbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge to those who look at climate and the physical conditions of life as the all important elements of distribution these facts ought to cause surprise as climate and height or depth graduate away insensibly but when we bear in mind that almost every species even in its metropolis would increase immensely in numbers were it not for other competing species that nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others in short that each organic being is either directly or indirectly related in the most important manner to other organic beings we must see that the range of the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends on insensibly changing physical conditions but in large part on the presence of other species on which it depends or by which it is destroyed or with which it comes into competition and as these species are already defined objects however they may have become so not blending one into another by insensible gradations the range of any one species depending as it does on the range of others will tend to be sharply defined moreover each species on the confines of its range where it exists in lessened numbers will during fluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey or in the seasons be extremely liable to utter extermination and thus its geographical range will come to be still more sharply defined if i am right in believing that allied or representative species when inhabiting a continuous area are generally so distributed that each has a wide range with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them in which they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer then as varieties do not essentially differ from species 176 the same rule will probably apply to both and if we in imagination adapt a varying species to a very large area we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas and a third variety to a narrow intermediate zone the intermediate variety consequently will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and lesser area and practically as far as i can make out this rule holds good with varieties in a state of nature i have met with striking instances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between well marked varieties in the genus balanus and it would appear from information given me by mr watson dr asa gray and mr wollaston that generally when varieties intermediate between two other forms occur they are much rarer numerically than the forms which they connect now if we may trust these facts and inferences and therefore conclude that varieties linking two other varieties together have generally existed in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect then i think we can understand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very long periods why as a general rule they should be exterminated and disappear sooner than the forms which they originally linked together for any form existing in lesser numbers would as already remarked run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers and in this particular case the intermediate form would be eminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both sides of it but a far more important consideration as i believe is that during the process of further modification by which two varieties are supposed on my theory to be converted and perfected into two distinct species the two which exist in larger numbers from inhabiting larger areas will have a great advantage over the intermediate variety which exists 177 in smaller numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone for forms existing in larger numbers will always have a better chance within any given period of presenting further favourable variations for natural selection to seize on than will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers hence the more common forms in the race for life will tend to beat and supplant the less common forms for these will be more slowly modified and improved it is the same principle which as i believe accounts for the common species in each country as shown in the second chapter presenting on an average a greater number of well marked varieties than do the rarer species i may illustrate what i mean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept one adapted to an extensive mountainous region a second to a comparatively narrow hilly tract and a third to wide plains at the base and that the inhabitants are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their stocks by selection the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of the great holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds more quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow hilly tract and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soon take the place of the less improved hill breed and thus the two breeds which originally existed in greater numbers will come into close contact with each other without the interposition of the supplanted intermediate hill variety to sum up i believe that species come to be tolerably well defined objects and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of varying and intermediate links firstly because new varieties are very slowly formed for variation is a very slow process and natural selection can do nothing until favourable 178 variations chance to occur and until a place in the natural polity of the country can be better filled by some modification of some one or more of its inhabitants and such new places will depend on slow changes of climate or on the occasional immigration of new inhabitants and probably in a still more important degree on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly modified with the new forms thus produced and the old ones acting and reacting on each other so that in any one region and at any one time we ought only to see a few species presenting slight modifications of structure in some degree permanent and this assuredly we do see secondly areas now continuous must often have existed within the recent period in isolated portions in which many forms more especially amongst the classes which unite for each birth and wander much may have separately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative species in this case intermediate varieties between the several representative species and their common parent must formerly have existed in each broken portion of the land but these links will have been supplanted and exterminated during the process of natural selection so that they will no longer exist in a living state thirdly when two or more varieties have been formed in different portions of a strictly continuous area intermediate varieties will it is probable at first have been formed in the intermediate zones but they will generally have had a short duration for these intermediate varieties will from reasons already assigned namely from what we know of the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species and likewise of acknowledged varieties exist in the intermediate zones in lesser numbers than the varieties which they 179 tend to connect from this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental extermination and during the process of further modification through natural selection they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they connect for these from existing in greater numbers will in the aggregate present more variation and thus be further improved through natural selection and gain further advantages lastly looking not to any one time but to all time if my theory be true numberless intermediate varieties linking most closely all the species of the same group together must assuredly have existed but the very process of natural selection constantly tends as has been so often remarked to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links consequently evidence of their former existence could be found only amongst fossil remains which are preserved as we shall in a future chapter attempt to show in an extremely imperfect and intermittent record on the origin and transitions of organic beings with peculiar habits and structure it has been asked by the opponents of such views as i hold how for instance a land carnivorous animal could have been converted into one with aquatic habits for how could the animal in its transitional state have subsisted it would be easy to show that within the same group carnivorous animals exist having every intermediate grade between truly aquatic and strictly terrestrial habits and as each exists by a struggle for life it is clear that each is well adapted in its habits to its place in nature look at the mustela vison of north america which has webbed feet and which resembles an otter in its fur short legs and form of tail during summer this animal 180 dives for and preys on fish but during the long winter it leaves the frozen waters and preys like other polecats on mice and land animals if a different case had been taken and it had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped could possibly have been converted into a flying bat the question would have been far more difficult and i could have given no answer yet i think such difficulties have very little weight here as on other occasions i lie under a heavy disadvantage for out of the many striking cases which i have collected i can give only one or two instances of transitional habits and structures in closely allied species of the same genus and of diversified habits either constant or occasional in the same species and it seems to me that nothing less than a long list of such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty in any particular case like that of the bat look at the family of squirrels here we have the finest gradation from animals with their tails only slightly flattened and from others as sir j richardson has remarked with the posterior part of their bodies rather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full to the so called flying squirrels and flying squirrels have their limbs and even the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin which serves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air to an astonishing distance from tree to tree we cannot doubt that each structure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country by enabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey or to collect food more quickly or as there is reason to believe by lessening the danger from occasional falls but it does not follow from this fact that the structure of each squirrel is the best that it is possible to conceive under all natural conditions let the climate and vegetation change let other competing 181 rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate or old ones become modified and all analogy would lead us to believe that some at least of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become exterminated unless they also became modified and improved in structure in a corresponding manner therefore i can see no difficulty more especially under changing conditions of life in the continued preservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flank membranes each modification being useful each being propagated until by the accumulated effects of this process of natural selection a perfect so called flying squirrel was produced now look at the galeopithecus or flying lemur which formerly was falsely ranked amongst bats it has an extremely wide flank membrane stretching from the corners of the jaw to the tail and including the limbs and the elongated fingers the flank membrane is also furnished with an extensor muscle although no graduated links of structure fitted for gliding through the air now connect the galeopithecus with the other lemuridг yet i see no difficulty in supposing that such links formerly existed and that each had been formed by the same steps as in the case of the less perfectly gliding squirrels and that each grade of structure was useful to its possessor nor can i see any insuperable difficulty in further believing it possible that the membrane connected fingers and forearm of the galeopithecus might be greatly lengthened by natural selection and this as far as the organs of flight are concerned would convert it into a bat in bats which have the wing membrane extended from the top of the shoulder to the tail including the hind legs we perhaps see traces of an apparatus originally constructed for gliding through the air rather than for flight 182 if about a dozen genera of birds had become extinct or were unknown who would have ventured to have surmised that birds might have existed which used their wings solely as flappers like the logger headed duck micropterus of eyton as fins in the water and front legs on the land like the penguin as sails like the ostrich and functionally for no purpose like the apteryx yet the structure of each of these birds is good for it under the conditions of life to which it is exposed for each has to live by a struggle but it is not necessarily the best possible under all possible conditions it must not be inferred from these remarks that any of the grades of wing structure here alluded to which perhaps may all have resulted from disuse indicate the natural steps by which birds have acquired their perfect power of flight but they serve at least to show what diversified means of transition are possible seeing that a few members of such water breathing classes as the crustacea and mollusca are adapted to live on the land and seeing that we have flying birds and mammals flying insects of the most diversified types and formerly had flying reptiles it is conceivable that flying fish which now glide far through the air slightly rising and turning by the aid of their fluttering fins might have been modified into perfectly winged animals if this had been effected who would have ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had been inhabitants of the open ocean and had used their incipient organs of flight exclusively as far as we know to escape being devoured by other fish when we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit as the wings of a bird for flight we should bear in mind that animals displaying early 183 transitional grades of the structure will seldom continue to exist to the present day for they will have been supplanted by the very process of perfection through natural selection furthermore we may conclude that transitional grades between structures fitted for very different habits of life will rarely have been developed at an early period in great numbers and under many subordinate forms thus to return to our imaginary illustration of the flying fish it does not seem probable that fishes capable of true flight would have been developed under many subordinate forms for taking prey of many kinds in many ways on the land and in the water until their organs of flight had come to a high stage of perfection so as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals in the battle for life hence the chance of discovering species with transitional grades of structure in a fossil condition will always be less from their having existed in lesser numbers than in the case of species with fully developed structures i will now give two or three instances of diversified and of changed habits in the individuals of the same species when either case occurs it would be easy for natural selection to fit the animal by some modification of its structure for its changed habits or exclusively for one of its several different habits but it is difficult to tell and immaterial for us whether habits generally change first and structure afterwards or whether slight modifications of structure lead to changed habits both probably often change almost simultaneously of cases of changed habits it will suffice merely to allude to that of the many british insects which now feed on exotic plants or exclusively on artificial substances of diversified habits innumerable instances could be given i have often watched a tyrant flycatcher saurophagus sulphuratus in south america hovering over one spot 184 and then proceeding to another like a kestrel and at other times standing stationary on the margin of water and then dashing like a kingfisher at a fish in our own country the larger titmouse parus major may be seen climbing branches almost like a creeper it often like a shrike kills small birds by blows on the head and i have many times seen and heard it hammering the seeds of the yew on a branch and thus breaking them like a nuthatch in north america the black bear was seen by hearne swimming for hours with widely open mouth thus catching almost like a whale insects in the water as we sometimes see individuals of a species following habits widely different from those of their own species and of the other species of the same genus we might expect on my theory that such individuals would occasionally have given rise to new species having anomalous habits and with their structure either slightly or considerably modified from that of their proper type and such instances do occur in nature can a more striking instance of adaptation be given than that of a woodpecker for climbing trees and for seizing insects in the chinks of the bark yet in north america there are woodpeckers which feed largely on fruit and others with elongated wings which chase insects on the wing and on the plains of la plata where not a tree grows there is a woodpecker which in every essential part of its organisation even in its colouring in the harsh tone of its voice and undulatory flight told me plainly of its close blood relationship to our common species yet it is a woodpecker which never climbs a tree petrels are the most aг rial and oceanic of birds yet in the quiet sounds of tierra del fuego the puffinuria berardi in its general habits in its astonishing power of diving its manner of swimming and of flying when 185 unwillingly it takes flight would be mistaken by any one for an auk or grebe nevertheless it is essentially a petrel but with many parts of its organisation profoundly modified on the other hand the acutest observer by examining the dead body of the water ouzel would never have suspected its sub aquatic habits yet this anomalous member of the strictly terrestrial thrush family wholly subsists by diving grasping the stones with its feet and using its wings under water he who believes that each being has been created as we now see it must occasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal having habits and structure not at all in agreement what can be plainer than that the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming yet there are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely or never go near the water and no one except audubon has seen the frigate bird which has all its four toes webbed alight on the surface of the sea on the other hand grebes and coots are eminently aquatic although their toes are only bordered by membrane what seems plainer than that the long toes of grallatores are formed for walking over swamps and floating plants yet the water hen is nearly as aquatic as the coot and the landrail nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge in such cases and many others could be given habits have changed without a corresponding change of structure the webbed feet of the upland goose may be said to have become rudimentary in function though not in structure in the frigate bird the deeply scooped membrane between the toes shows that structure has begun to change he who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation will say that in these cases it has pleased the creator to cause a being of one type to take the place of one of another type but this seems to me only 186 restating the fact in dignified language he who believes in the struggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection will acknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring to increase in numbers and that if any one being vary ever so little either in habits or structure and thus gain an advantage over some other inhabitant of the country it will seize on the place of that inhabitant however different it may be from its own place hence it will cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigate birds with webbed feet living on the dry land or most rarely alighting on the water that there should be long toed corncrakes living in meadows instead of in swamps that there should be woodpeckers where not a tree grows that there should be diving thrushes and petrels with the habits of auks organs of extreme perfection and complication to suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances for admitting different amounts of light and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration could have been formed by natural selection seems i freely confess absurd in the highest possible degree yet reason tells me that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one very imperfect and simple each grade being useful to its possessor can be shown to exist if further the eye does vary ever so slightly and the variations be inherited which is certainly the case and if any variation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal under changing conditions of life then the difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection though insuperable by our imagination can hardly be considered real how a nerve comes to be sensitive to 187 light hardly concerns us more than how life itself first originated but i may remark that several facts make me suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound in looking for the gradations by which an organ in any species has been perfected we ought to look exclusively to its lineal ancestors but this is scarcely ever possible and we are forced in each case to look to species of the same group that is to the collateral descendants from the same original parent form in order to see what gradations are possible and for the chance of some gradations having been transmitted from the earlier stages of descent in an unaltered or little altered condition amongst existing vertebrata we find but a small amount of gradation in the structure of the eye and from fossil species we can learn nothing on this head in this great class we should probably have to descend far beneath the lowest known fossiliferous stratum to discover the earlier stages by which the eye has been perfected in the articulata we can commence a series with an optic nerve merely coated with pigment and without any other mechanism and from this low stage numerous gradations of structure branching off in two fundamentally different lines can be shown to exist until we reach a moderately high stage of perfection in certain crustaceans for instance there is a double cornea the inner one divided into facets within each of which there is a lens shaped swelling in other crustaceans the transparent cones which are coated by pigment and which properly act only by excluding lateral pencils of light are convex at their upper ends and must act by convergence and at their lower ends there seems to be an imperfect vitreous substance 188 with these facts here far too briefly and imperfectly given which show that there is much graduated diversity in the eyes of living crustaceans and bearing in mind how small the number of living animals is in proportion to those which have become extinct i can see no very great difficulty not more than in the case of many other structures in believing that natural selection has converted the simple apparatus of an optic nerve merely coated with pigment and invested by transparent membrane into an optical instrument as perfect as is possessed by any member of the great articulate class he who will go thus far if he find on finishing this treatise that large bodies of facts otherwise inexplicable can be explained by the theory of descent ought not to hesitate to go further and to admit that a structure even as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formed by natural selection although in this case he does not know any of the transitional grades his reason ought to conquer his imagination though i have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any degree of hesitation in extending the principle of natural selection to such startling lengths it is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope we know that this instrument has been perfected by the long continued efforts of the highest human intellects and we naturally infer that the eye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process but may not this inference be presumptuous have we any right to assume that the creator works by intellectual powers like those of man if we must compare the eye to an optical instrument we ought in imagination to take a thick layer of transparent tissue with a nerve sensitive to light beneath and then suppose every part of this layer to be continually changing 189 slowly in density so as to separate into layers of different densities and thicknesses placed at different distances from each other and with the surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form further we must suppose that there is a power always intently watching each slight accidental alteration in the transparent layers and carefully selecting each alteration which under varied circumstances may in any way or in any degree tend to produce a distincter image we must suppose each new state of the instrument to be multiplied by the million and each to be preserved till a better be produced and then the old ones to be destroyed in living bodies variation will cause the slight alterations generation will multiply them almost infinitely and natural selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement let this process go on for millions on millions of years and during each year on millions of individuals of many kinds and may we not believe that a living optical instrument might thus be formed as superior to one of glass as the works of the creator are to those of man if it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous successive slight modifications my theory would absolutely break down but i can find out no such case no doubt many organs exist of which we do not know the transitional grades more especially if we look to much isolated species round which according to my theory there has been much extinction or again if we look to an organ common to all the members of a large class for in this latter case the organ must have been first formed at an extremely remote period since which all the many members of the class have been developed and in order to discover the early transitional grades through which the organ has 190 passed we should have to look to very ancient ancestral forms long since become extinct we should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could not have been formed by transitional gradations of some kind numerous cases could be given amongst the lower animals of the same organ performing at the same time wholly distinct functions thus the alimentary canal respires digests and excretes in the larva of the dragon fly and in the fish cobites in the hydra the animal may be turned inside out and the exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire in such cases natural selection might easily specialise if any advantage were thus gained a part or organ which had performed two functions for one function alone and thus wholly change its nature by insensible steps two distinct organs sometimes perform simultaneously the same function in the same individual to give one instance there are fish with gills or branchiг that breathe the air dissolved in the water at the same time that they breathe free air in their swimbladders this latter organ having a ductus pneumaticus for its supply and being divided by highly vascular partitions in these cases one of the two organs might with ease be modified and perfected so as to perform all the work by itself being aided during the process of modification by the other organ and then this other organ might be modified for some other and quite distinct purpose or be quite obliterated the illustration of the swimbladder in fishes is a good one because it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose namely flotation may be converted into one for a wholly different purpose namely respiration the swimbladder has also been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certain fish or for i do not know 191 which view is now generally held a part of the auditory apparatus has been worked in as a complement to the swimbladder all physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous or ideally similar in position and structure with the lungs of the higher vertebrate animals hence there seems to me to be no great difficulty in believing that natural selection has actually converted a swimbladder into a lung or organ used exclusively for respiration i can indeed hardly doubt that all vertebrate animals having true lungs have descended by ordinary generation from an ancient prototype of which we know nothing furnished with a floating apparatus or swimbladder we can thus as i infer from professor owen s interesting description of these parts understand the strange fact that every particle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over the orifice of the trachea with some risk of falling into the lungs notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottis is closed in the higher vertebrata the branchiг have wholly disappeared the slits on the sides of the neck and the loop like course of the arteries still marking in the embryo their former position but it is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiг might have been gradually worked in by natural selection for some quite distinct purpose in the same manner as on the view entertained by some naturalists that the branchiг and dorsal scales of annelids are homologous with the wings and wing covers of insects it is probable that organs which at a very ancient period served for respiration have been actually converted into organs of flight in considering transitions of organs it is so important to bear in mind the probability of conversion from one function to another that i will give one more instance pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds of skin 192 called by me the ovigerous frena which serve through the means of a sticky secretion to retain the eggs until they are hatched within the sack these cirripedes have no branchiг the whole surface of the body and sack including the small frena serving for respiration the balanidг or sessile cirripedes on the other hand have no ovigerous frena the eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack in the well enclosed shell but they have large folded branchiг now i think no one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one family are strictly homologous with the branchiг of the other family indeed they graduate into each other therefore i do not doubt that little folds of skin which originally served as ovigerous frena but which likewise very slightly aided the act of respiration have been gradually converted by natural selection into branchiг simply through an increase in their size and the obliteration of their adhesive glands if all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct and they have already suffered far more extinction than have sessile cirripedes who would ever have imagined that the branchiг in this latter family had originally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being washed out of the sack although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organ could not possibly have been produced by successive transitional gradations yet undoubtedly grave cases of difficulty occur some of which will be discussed in my future work one of the gravest is that of neuter insects which are often very differently constructed from either the males or fertile females but this case will be treated of in the next chapter the electric organs of fishes offer another case of special difficulty it is impossible to conceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced but as owen and others have remarked 193 their intimate structure closely resembles that of common muscle and as it has lately been shown that rays have an organ closely analogous to the electric apparatus and yet do not as matteucci asserts discharge any electricity we must own that we are far too ignorant to argue that no transition of any kind is possible the electric organs offer another and even more serious difficulty for they occur in only about a dozen fishes of which several are widely remote in their affinities generally when the same organ appears in several members of the same class especially if in members having very different habits of life we may attribute its presence to inheritance from a common ancestor and its absence in some of the members to its loss through disuse or natural selection but if the electric organs had been inherited from one ancient progenitor thus provided we might have expected that all electric fishes would have been specially related to each other nor does geology at all lead to the belief that formerly most fishes had electric organs which most of their modified descendants have lost the presence of luminous organs in a few insects belonging to different families and orders offers a parallel case of difficulty other cases could be given for instance in plants the very curious contrivance of a mass of pollen grains borne on a foot stalk with a sticky gland at the end is the same in orchis and asclepias genera almost as remote as possible amongst flowering plants in all these cases of two very distinct species furnished with apparently the same anomalous organ it should be observed that although the general appearance and function of the organ may be the same yet some fundamental difference can generally be detected i am inclined to believe that in nearly the same way as two men have sometimes independently hit on 194 the very same invention so natural selection working for the good of each being and taking advantage of analogous variations has sometimes modified in very nearly the same manner two parts in two organic beings which beings owe but little of their structure in common to inheritance from the same ancestor although in many cases it is most difficult to conjecture by what transitions organs could have arrived at their present state yet considering that the proportion of living and known forms to the extinct and unknown is very small i have been astonished how rarely an organ can be named towards which no transitional grade is known to lead the truth of this remark is indeed shown by that old but somewhat exaggerated canon in natural history of natura non facit saltum we meet with this admission in the writings of almost every experienced naturalist or as milne edwards has well expressed it nature is prodigal in variety but niggard in innovation why on the theory of creation should this be so why should all the parts and organs of many independent beings each supposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature be so commonly linked together by graduated steps why should not nature have taken a leap from structure to structure on the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand why she should not for natural selection can act only by taking advantage of slight successive variations she can never take a leap but must advance by the shortest and slowest steps organs of little apparent importance as natural selection acts by life and death by the preservation of individuals with any favourable variation and by the destruction of those with any unfavourable deviation of structure i have sometimes felt much difficulty in 195 understanding the origin of simple parts of which the importance does not seem sufficient to cause the preservation of successively varying individuals i have sometimes felt as much difficulty though of a very different kind on this head as in the case of an organ as perfect and complex as the eye in the first place we are much too ignorant in regard to the whole economy of any one organic being to say what slight modifications would be of importance or not in a former chapter i have given instances of most trifling characters such as the down on fruit and the colour of its flesh which from determining the attacks of insects or from being correlated with constitutional differences might assuredly be acted on by natural selection the tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially constructed fly flapper and it seems at first incredible that this could have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slight modifications each better and better for so trifling an object as driving away flies yet we should pause before being too positive even in this case for we know that the distribution and existence of cattle and other animals in south america absolutely depends on their power of resisting the attacks of insects so that individuals which could by any means defend themselves from these small enemies would be able to range into new pastures and thus gain a great advantage it is not that the larger quadrupeds are actually destroyed except in some rare cases by flies but they are incessantly harassed and their strength reduced so that they are more subject to disease or not so well enabled in a coming dearth to search for food or to escape from beasts of prey organs now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been of high importance to an early progenitor and after having been slowly perfected at a 196 former period have been transmitted in nearly the same state although now become of very slight use and any actually injurious deviations in their structure will always have been checked by natural selection seeing how important an organ of locomotion the tail is in most aquatic animals its general presence and use for many purposes in so many land animals which in their lungs or modified swimbladders betray their aquatic origin may perhaps be thus accounted for a well developed tail having been formed in an aquatic animal it might subsequently come to be worked in for all sorts of purposes as a fly flapper an organ of prehension or as an aid in turning as with the dog though the aid must be slight for the hare with hardly any tail can double quickly enough in the second place we may sometimes attribute importance to characters which are really of very little importance and which have originated from quite secondary causes independently of natural selection we should remember that climate food c probably have some little direct influence on the organisation that characters reappear from the law of reversion that correlation of growth will have had a most important influence in modifying various structures and finally that sexual selection will often have largely modified the external characters of animals having a will to give one male an advantage in fighting with another or in charming the females moreover when a modification of structure has primarily arisen from the above or other unknown causes it may at first have been of no advantage to the species but may subsequently have been taken advantage of by the descendants of the species under new conditions of life and with newly acquired habits to give a few instances to illustrate these latter 197 remarks if green woodpeckers alone had existed and we did not know that there were many black and pied kinds i dare say that we should have thought that the green colour was a beautiful adaptation to hide this tree frequenting bird from its enemies and consequently that it was a character of importance and might have been acquired through natural selection as it is i have no doubt that the colour is due to some quite distinct cause probably to sexual selection a trailing bamboo in the malay archipelago climbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooks clustered around the ends of the branches and this contrivance no doubt is of the highest service to the plant but as we see nearly similar hooks on many trees which are not climbers the hooks on the bamboo may have arisen from unknown laws of growth and have been subsequently taken advantage of by the plant undergoing further modification and becoming a climber the naked skin on the head of a vulture is generally looked at as a direct adaptation for wallowing in putridity and so it may be or it may possibly be due to the direct action of putrid matter but we should be very cautious in drawing any such inference when we see that the skin on the head of the clean feeding male turkey is likewise naked the sutures in the skulls of young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aiding parturition and no doubt they facilitate or may be indispensable for this act but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds and reptiles which have only to escape from a broken egg we may infer that this structure has arisen from the laws of growth and has been taken advantage of in the parturition of the higher animals we are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight and unimportant variations and we are 198 immediately made conscious of this by reflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animals in different countries more especially in the less civilised countries where there has been but little artificial selection careful observers are convinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair and that with the hair the horns are correlated mountain breeds always differ from lowland breeds and a mountainous country would probably affect the hind limbs from exercising them more and possibly even the form of the pelvis and then by the law of homologous variation the front limbs and even the head would probably be affected the shape also of the pelvis might affect by pressure the shape of the head of the young in the womb the laborious breathing necessary in high regions would we have some reason to believe increase the size of the chest and again correlation would come into play animals kept by savages in different countries often have to struggle for their own subsistence and would be exposed to a certain extent to natural selection and individuals with slightly different constitutions would succeed best under different climates and there is reason to believe that constitution and colour are correlated a good observer also states that in cattle susceptibility to the attacks of flies is correlated with colour as is the liability to be poisoned by certain plants so that colour would be thus subjected to the action of natural selection but we are far too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of the several known and unknown laws of variation and i have here alluded to them only to show that if we are unable to account for the characteristic differences of our domestic breeds which nevertheless we generally admit to have arisen through ordinary generation we ought not to lay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause 199 of the slight analogous differences between species i might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man which are so strongly marked i may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous the foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest lately made by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that every detail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor they believe that very many structures have been created for beauty in the eyes of man or for mere variety this doctrine if true would be absolutely fatal to my theory yet i fully admit that many structures are of no direct use to their possessors physical conditions probably have had some little effect on structure quite independently of any good thus gained correlation of growth has no doubt played a most important part and a useful modification of one part will often have entailed on other parts diversified changes of no direct use so again characters which formerly were useful or which formerly had arisen from correlation of growth or from other unknown cause may reappear from the law of reversion though now of no direct use the effects of sexual selection when displayed in beauty to charm the females can be called useful only in rather a forced sense but by far the most important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of every being is simply due to inheritance and consequently though each being assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature many structures now have no direct relation to the habits of life of each species thus we can hardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland 200 goose or of the frigate bird are of special use to these birds we cannot believe that the same bones in the arm of the monkey in the fore leg of the horse in the wing of the bat and in the nipper of the seal are of special use to these animals we may safely attribute these structures to inheritance but to the progenitor of the upland goose and of the frigate bird webbed feet no doubt were as useful as they now are to the most aquatic of existing birds so we may believe that the progenitor of the seal had not a nipper but a foot with five toes fitted for walking or grasping and we may further venture to believe that the several bones in the limbs of the monkey horse and bat which have been inherited from a common progenitor were formerly of more special use to that progenitor or its progenitors than they now are to these animals having such widely diversified habits therefore we may infer that these several bones might have been acquired through natural selection subjected formerly as now to the several laws of inheritance reversion correlation of growth c hence every detail of structure in every living creature making some little allowance for the direct action of physical conditions may be viewed either as having been of special use to some ancestral form or as being now of special use to the descendants of this form either directly or indirectly through the complex laws of growth natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in any one species exclusively for the good of another species though throughout nature one species incessantly takes advantage of and profits by the structure of another but natural selection can and does often produce structures for the direct injury of other species as we see in the fang of the adder and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon by which its eggs are 201 deposited in the living bodies of other insects if it could be proved that any part of the structure of any one species had been formed for the exclusive good of another species it would annihilate my theory for such could not have been produced through natural selection although many statements may be found in works on natural history to this effect i cannot find even one which seems to me of any weight it is admitted that the rattlesnake has a poison fang for its own defence and for the destruction of its prey but some authors suppose that at the same time this snake is furnished with a rattle for its own injury namely to warn its prey to escape i would almost as soon believe that the cat curls the end of its tail when preparing to spring in order to warn the doomed mouse but i have not space here to enter on this and other such cases natural selection will never produce in a being anything injurious to itself for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of each no organ will be formed as paley has remarked for the purpose of causing pain or for doing an injury to its possessor if a fair balance be struck between the good and evil caused by each part each will be found on the whole advantageous after the lapse of time under changing conditions of life if any part comes to be injurious it will be modified or if it be not so the being will become extinct as myriads have become extinct natural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as or slightly more perfect than the other inhabitants of the same country with which it has to struggle for existence and we see that this is the degree of perfection attained under nature the endemic productions of new zealand for instance are perfect one compared with another but they are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plants 202 and animals introduced from europe natural selection will not produce absolute perfection nor do we always meet as far as we can judge with this high standard under nature the correction for the aberration of light is said on high authority not to be perfect even in that most perfect organ the eye if our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasm a multitude of inimitable contrivances in nature this same reason tells us though we may easily err on both sides that some other contrivances are less perfect can we consider the sting of the wasp or of the bee as perfect which when used against many attacking animals cannot be withdrawn owing to the backward serratures and so inevitably causes the death of the insect by tearing out its viscera if we look at the sting of the bee as having originally existed in a remote progenitor as a boring and serrated instrument like that in so many members of the same great order and which has been modified but not perfected for its present purpose with the poison originally adapted to cause galls subsequently intensified we can perhaps understand how it is that the use of the sting should so often cause the insect s own death for if on the whole the power of stinging be useful to the community it will fulfil all the requirements of natural selection though it may cause the death of some few members if we admire the truly wonderful power of scent by which the males of many insects find their females can we admire the production for this single purpose of thousands of drones which are utterly useless to the community for any other end and which are ultimately slaughtered by their industrious and sterile sisters it may be difficult but we ought to admire the savage instinctive hatred of the queen bee which urges her instantly to destroy the 203 young queens her daughters as soon as born or to perish herself in the combat for undoubtedly this is for the good of the community and maternal love or maternal hatred though the latter fortunately is most rare is all the same to the inexorable principle of natural selection if we admire the several ingenious contrivances by which the flowers of the orchis and of many other plants are fertilised through insect agency can we consider as equally perfect the elaboration by our fir trees of dense clouds of pollen in order that a few granules may be wafted by a chance breeze on to the ovules summary of chapter we have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties and objections which may be urged against my theory many of them are very serious but i think that in the discussion light has been thrown on several facts which on the theory of independent acts of creation are utterly obscure we have seen that species at any one period are not indefinitely variable and are not linked together by a multitude of intermediate gradations partly because the process of natural selection will always be very slow and will act at any one time only on a very few forms and partly because the very process of natural selection almost implies the continual supplanting and extinction of preceding and intermediate gradations closely allied species now living on a continuous area must often have been formed when the area was not continuous and when the conditions of life did not insensibly graduate away from one part to another when two varieties are formed in two districts of a continuous area an intermediate variety will often be formed fitted for an intermediate zone but from reasons assigned the intermediate variety will usually exist in lesser numbers than 204 the two forms which it connects consequently the two latter during the course of further modification from existing in greater numbers will have a great advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety and will thus generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it we have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concluding that the most different habits of life could not graduate into each other that a bat for instance could not have been formed by natural selection from an animal which at first could only glide through the air we have seen that a species may under new conditions of life change its habits or have diversified habits with some habits very unlike those of its nearest congeners hence we can understand bearing in mind that each organic being is trying to live wherever it can live how it has arisen that there are upland geese with webbed feet ground woodpeckers diving thrushes and petrels with the habits of auks although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have been formed by natural selection is more than enough to stagger any one yet in the case of any organ if we know of a long series of gradations in complexity each good for its possessor then under changing conditions of life there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of any conceivable degree of perfection through natural selection in the cases in which we know of no intermediate or transitional states we should be very cautious in concluding that none could have existed for the homologies of many organs and their intermediate states show that wonderful metamorphoses in function are at least possible for instance a swim bladder has apparently been converted into an air breathing lung the same organ having performed 205 simultaneously very different functions and then having been specialised for one function and two very distinct organs having performed at the same time the same function the one having been perfected whilst aided by the other must often have largely facilitated transitions we are far too ignorant in almost every case to be enabled to assert that any part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species that modifications in its structure could not have been slowly accumulated by means of natural selection but we may confidently believe that many modifications wholly due to the laws of growth and at first in no way advantageous to a species have been subsequently taken advantage of by the still further modified descendants of this species we may also believe that a part formerly of high importance has often been retained as the tail of an aquatic animal by its terrestrial descendants though it has become of such small importance that it could not in its present state have been acquired by natural selection a power which acts solely by the preservation of profitable variations in the struggle for life natural selection will produce nothing in one species for the exclusive good or injury of another though it may well produce parts organs and excretions highly useful or even indispensable or highly injurious to another species but in all cases at the same time useful to the owner natural selection in each well stocked country must act chiefly through the competition of the inhabitants one with another and consequently will produce perfection or strength in the battle for life only according to the standard of that country hence the inhabitants of one country generally the smaller one will often yield as we see they do yield to the inhabitants of another and generally larger country for in 206 the larger country there will have existed more individuals and more diversified forms and the competition will have been severer and thus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher natural selection will not necessarily produce absolute perfection nor as far as we can judge by our limited faculties can absolute perfection be everywhere found on the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the full meaning of that old canon in natural history natura non facit saltum this canon if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world is not strictly correct but if we include all those of past times it must by my theory be strictly true it is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed on two great laws unity of type and the conditions of existence by unity of type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure which we see in organic beings of the same class and which is quite independent of their habits of life on my theory unity of type is explained by unity of descent the expression of conditions of existence so often insisted on by the illustrious cuvier is fully embraced by the principle of natural selection for natural selection acts by either now adapting the varying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions of life or by having adapted them during long past periods of time the adaptations being aided in some cases by use and disuse being slightly affected by the direct action of the external conditions of life and being in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth hence in fact the law of the conditions of existence is the higher law as it includes through the inheritance of former adaptations that of unity of type 207 chapter vii instinct instincts comparable with habits but different in their origin instincts graduated aphides and ants instincts variable domestic instincts their origin natural instincts of the cuckoo ostrich and parasitic bees slave making ants hive bee its cell making instinct difficulties on the theory of the natural selection of instincts neuter or sterile insects summary the subject of instinct might have been worked into the previous chapters but i have thought that it would be more convenient to treat the subject separately especially as so wonderful an instinct as that of the hive bee making its cells will probably have occurred to many readers as a difficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole theory i must premise that i have nothing to do with the origin of the primary mental powers any more than i have with that of life itself we are concerned only with the diversities of instinct and of the other mental qualities of animals within the same class i will not attempt any definition of instinct it would be easy to show that several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term but every one understands what is meant when it is said that instinct impels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds nests an action which we ourselves should require experience to enable us to perform when performed by an animal more especially by a very young one without any experience and when performed by many individuals in the same way without their knowing for what purpose it is performed is usually said to be instinctive 208 but i could show that none of these characters of instinct are universal a little dose as pierre huber expresses it of judgment or reason often comes into play even in animals very low in the scale of nature frederick cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have compared instinct with habit this comparison gives i think a remarkably accurate notion of the frame of mind under which an instinctive action is performed but not of its origin how unconsciously many habitual actions are performed indeed not rarely in direct opposition to our conscious will yet they may be modified by the will or reason habits easily become associated with other habits and with certain periods of time and states of the body when once acquired they often remain constant throughout life several other points of resemblance between instincts and habits could be pointed out as in repeating a well known song so in instincts one action follows another by a sort of rhythm if a person be interrupted in a song or in repeating anything by rote he is generally forced to go back to recover the habitual train of thought so p huber found it was with a caterpillar which makes a very complicated hammock for if he took a caterpillar which had completed its hammock up to say the sixth stage of construction and put it into a hammock completed up only to the third stage the caterpillar simply re performed the fourth fifth and sixth stages of construction if however a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up for instance to the third stage and were put into one finished up to the sixth stage so that much of its work was already done for it far from feeling the benefit of this it was much embarrassed and in order to complete its hammock seemed forced to start from the third stage where it had left off and thus tried to complete the already finished work 209 if we suppose any habitual action to become inherited and i think it can be shown that this does sometimes happen then the resemblance between what originally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close as not to be distinguished if mozart instead of playing the pianoforte at three years old with wonderfully little practice had played a tune with no practice at all he might truly be said to have done so instinctively but it would be the most serious error to suppose that the greater number of instincts have been acquired by habit in one generation and then transmitted by inheritance to succeeding generations it can be clearly shown that the most wonderful instincts with which we are acquainted namely those of the hive bee and of many ants could not possibly have been thus acquired it will be universally admitted that instincts are as important as corporeal structure for the welfare of each species under its present conditions of life under changed conditions of life it is at least possible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to a species and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little then i can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving and continually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that may be profitable it is thus as i believe that all the most complex and wonderful instincts have originated as modifications of corporeal structure arise from and are increased by use or habit and are diminished or lost by disuse so i do not doubt it has been with instincts but i believe that the effects of habit are of quite subordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of what may be called accidental variations of instincts that is of variations produced by the same unknown causes which produce slight deviations of bodily structure no complex instinct can possibly be produced through 210 natural selection except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous slight yet profitable variations hence as in the case of corporeal structures we ought to find in nature not the actual transitional gradations by which each complex instinct has been acquired for these could be found only in the lineal ancestors of each species but we ought to find in the collateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations or we ought at least to be able to show that gradations of some kind are possible and this we certainly can do i have been surprised to find making allowance for the instincts of animals having been but little observed except in europe and north america and for no instinct being known amongst extinct species how very generally gradations leading to the most complex instincts can be discovered changes of instinct may sometimes be facilitated by the same species having different instincts at different periods of life or at different seasons of the year or when placed under different circumstances c in which case either one or the other instinct might be preserved by natural selection and such instances of diversity of instinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature again as in the case of corporeal structure and conformably with my theory the instinct of each species is good for itself but has never as far as we can judge been produced for the exclusive good of others one of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing an action for the sole good of another with which i am acquainted is that of aphides voluntarily yielding their sweet excretion to ants that they do so voluntarily the following facts show i removed all the ants from a group of about a dozen aphides on a dock plant and prevented their attendance during several hours after this interval i felt sure that the aphides 211 would want to excrete i watched them for some time through a lens but not one excreted i then tickled and stroked them with a hair in the same manner as well as i could as the ants do with their antennг but not one excreted afterwards i allowed an ant to visit them and it immediately seemed by its eager way of running about to be well aware what a rich flock it had discovered it then began to play with its antennг on the abdomen first of one aphis and then of another and each aphis as soon as it felt the antennг immediately lifted up its abdomen and excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice which was eagerly devoured by the ant even the quite young aphides behaved in this manner showing that the action was instinctive and not the result of experience but as the excretion is extremely viscid it is probably a convenience to the aphides to have it removed and therefore probably the aphides do not instinctively excrete for the sole good of the ants although i do not believe that any animal in the world performs an action for the exclusive good of another of a distinct species yet each species tries to take advantage of the instincts of others as each takes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of others so again in some few cases certain instincts cannot be considered as absolutely perfect but as details on this and other such points are not indispensable they may be here passed over as some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature and the inheritance of such variations are indispensable for the action of natural selection as many instances as possible ought to be here given but want of space prevents me i can only assert that instincts certainly do vary for instance the migratory instinct both in extent and direction and in its total loss so it is with the nests of birds which vary partly 212 in dependence on the situations chosen and on the nature and temperature of the country inhabited but often from causes wholly unknown to us audubon has given several remarkable cases of differences in the nests of the same species in the northern and southern united states fear of any particular enemy is certainly an instinctive quality as may be seen in nestling birds though it is strengthened by experience and by the sight of fear of the same enemy in other animals but fear of man is slowly acquired as i have elsewhere shown by various animals inhabiting desert islands and we may see an instance of this even in england in the greater wildness of all our large birds than of our small birds for the large birds have been most persecuted by man we may safely attribute the greater wildness of our large birds to this cause for in uninhabited islands large birds are not more fearful than small and the magpie so wary in england is tame in norway as is the hooded crow in egypt that the general disposition of individuals of the same species born in a state of nature is extremely diversified can be shown by a multitude of facts several cases also could be given of occasional and strange habits in certain species which might if advantageous to the species give rise through natural selection to quite new instincts but i am well aware that these general statements without facts given in detail can produce but a feeble effect on the reader s mind i can only repeat my assurance that i do not speak without good evidence the possibility or even probability of inherited variations of instinct in a state of nature will be strengthened by briefly considering a few cases under domestication we shall thus also be enabled to see the respective parts which habit and the selection of 213 so called accidental variations have played in modifying the mental qualities of our domestic animals a number of curious and authentic instances could be given of the inheritance of all shades of disposition and tastes and likewise of the oddest tricks associated with certain frames of mind or periods of time but let us look to the familiar case of the several breeds of dogs it cannot be doubted that young pointers i have myself seen a striking instance will sometimes point and even back other dogs the very first time that they are taken out retrieving is certainly in some degree inherited by retrievers and a tendency to run round instead of at a flock of sheep by shepherd dogs i cannot see that these actions performed without experience by the young and in nearly the same manner by each individual performed with eager delight by each breed and without the end being known for the young pointer can no more know that he points to aid his master than the white butterfly knows why she lays her eggs on the leaf of the cabbage i cannot see that these actions differ essentially from true instincts if we were to see one kind of wolf when young and without any training as soon as it scented its prey stand motionless like a statue and then slowly crawl forward with a peculiar gait and another kind of wolf rushing round instead of at a herd of deer and driving them to a distant point we should assuredly call these actions instinctive domestic instincts as they may be called are certainly far less fixed or invariable than natural instincts but they have been acted on by far less rigorous selection and have been transmitted for an incomparably shorter period under less fixed conditions of life how strongly these domestic instincts habits and dispositions are inherited and how curiously they become mingled is well shown when different breeds of dogs are 214 crossed thus it is known that a cross with a bull dog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacy of greyhounds and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole family of shepherd dogs a tendency to hunt hares these domestic instincts when thus tested by crossing resemble natural instincts which in a like manner become curiously blended together and for a long period exhibit traces of the instincts of either parent for example le roy describes a dog whose great grandfather was a wolf and this dog showed a trace of its wild parentage only in one way by not coming in a straight line to his master when called domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have become inherited solely from long continued and compulsory habit but this i think is not true no one would ever have thought of teaching or probably could have taught the tumbler pigeon to tumble an action which as i have witnessed is performed by young birds that have never seen a pigeon tumble we may believe that some one pigeon showed a slight tendency to this strange habit and that the long continued selection of the best individuals in successive generations made tumblers what they now are and near glasgow there are house tumblers as i hear from mr brent which cannot fly eighteen inches high without going head over heels it may be doubted whether any one would have thought of training a dog to point had not some one dog naturally shown a tendency in this line and this is known occasionally to happen as i once saw in a pure terrier the act of pointing is probably as many have thought only the exaggerated pause of an animal preparing to spring on its prey when the first tendency to point was once displayed methodical selection and the inherited effects of compulsory training in each successive generation would soon complete the 215 work and unconscious selection is still at work as each man tries to procure without intending to improve the breed dogs which will stand and hunt best on the other hand habit alone in some cases has sufficed no animal is more difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit scarcely any animal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit but i do not suppose that domestic rabbits have ever been selected for tameness and i presume that we must attribute the whole of the inherited change from extreme wildness to extreme tameness simply to habit and long continued close confinement natural instincts are lost under domestication a remarkable instance of this is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become broody that is never wish to sit on their eggs familiarity alone prevents our seeing how universally and largely the minds of our domestic animals have been modified by domestication it is scarcely possible to doubt that the love of man has become instinctive in the dog all wolves foxes jackals and species of the cat genus when kept tame are most eager to attack poultry sheep and pigs and this tendency has been found incurable in dogs which have been brought home as puppies from countries such as tierra del fuego and australia where the savages do not keep these domestic animals how rarely on the other hand do our civilised dogs even when quite young require to be taught not to attack poultry sheep and pigs no doubt they occasionally do make an attack and are then beaten and if not cured they are destroyed so that habit with some degree of selection has probably concurred in civilising by inheritance our dogs on the other hand young chickens have lost wholly by habit that fear of the dog and cat which no doubt was originally instinctive in them in the same way as it is so plainly instinctive in 216 young pheasants though reared under a hen it is not that chickens have lost all fear but fear only of dogs and cats for if the hen gives the danger chuckle they will run more especially young turkeys from under her and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass or thickets and this is evidently done for the instinctive purpose of allowing as we see in wild ground birds their mother to fly away but this instinct retained by our chickens has become useless under domestication for the mother hen has almost lost by disuse the power of flight hence we may conclude that domestic instincts have been acquired and natural instincts have been lost partly by habit and partly by man selecting and accumulating during successive generations peculiar mental habits and actions which at first appeared from what we must in our ignorance call an accident in some cases compulsory habit alone has sufficed to produce such inherited mental changes in other cases compulsory habit has done nothing and all has been the result of selection pursued both methodically and unconsciously but in most cases probably habit and selection have acted together we shall perhaps best understand how instincts in a state of nature have become modified by selection by considering a few cases i will select only three out of the several which i shall have to discuss in my future work namely the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay her eggs in other birds nests the slave making instinct of certain ants and the comb making power of the hive bee these two latter instincts have generally and most justly been ranked by naturalists as the most wonderful of all known instincts it is now commonly admitted that the more immediate and final cause of the cuckoo s instinct is that 217 she lays her eggs not daily but at intervals of two or three days so that if she were to make her own nest and sit on her own eggs those first laid would have to be left for some time unincubated or there would be eggs and young birds of different ages in the same nest if this were the case the process of laying and hatching might be inconveniently long more especially as she has to migrate at a very early period and the first hatched young would probably have to be fed by the male alone but the american cuckoo is in this predicament for she makes her own nest and has eggs and young successively hatched all at the same time it has been asserted that the american cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other birds nests but i hear on the high authority of dr brewer that this is a mistake nevertheless i could give several instances of various birds which have been known occasionally to lay their eggs in other birds nests now let us suppose that the ancient progenitor of our european cuckoo had the habits of the american cuckoo but that occasionally she laid an egg in another bird s nest if the old bird profited by this occasional habit or if the young were made more vigorous by advantage having been taken of the mistaken maternal instinct of another bird than by their own mother s care encumbered as she can hardly fail to be by having eggs and young of different ages at the same time then the old birds or the fostered young would gain an advantage and analogy would lead me to believe that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by inheritance the occasional and aberrant habit of their mother and in their turn would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds nests and thus be successful in rearing their young by a continued process of this nature i believe that the strange instinct of our cuckoo could be and has been 218 generated i may add that according to dr gray and to some other observers the european cuckoo has not utterly lost all maternal love and care for her own offspring the occasional habit of birds laying their eggs in other birds nests either of the same or of a distinct species is not very uncommon with the gallinaceг and this perhaps explains the origin of a singular instinct in the allied group of ostriches for several hen ostriches at least in the case of the american species unite and lay first a few eggs in one nest and then in another and these are hatched by the males this instinct may probably be accounted for by the fact of the hens laying a large number of eggs but as in the case of the cuckoo at intervals of two or three days this instinct however of the american ostrich has not as yet been perfected for a surprising number of eggs lie strewed over the plains so that in one day s hunting i picked up no less than twenty lost and wasted eggs many bees are parasitic and always lay their eggs in the nests of bees of other kinds this case is more remarkable than that of the cuckoo for these bees have not only their instincts but their structure modified in accordance with their parasitic habits for they do not possess the pollen collecting apparatus which would be necessary if they had to store food for their own young some species likewise of sphegidг wasp like insects are parasitic on other species and m fabre has lately shown good reason for believing that although the tachytes nigra generally makes its own burrow and stores it with paralysed prey for its own larvг to feed on yet that when this insect finds a burrow already made and stored by another sphex it takes advantage of the prize and becomes for the occasion parasitic in this case as with the supposed case of the cuckoo i can 219 see no difficulty in natural selection making an occasional habit permanent if of advantage to the species and if the insect whose nest and stored food are thus feloniously appropriated be not thus exterminated slave making instinct this remarkable instinct was first discovered in the formica polyerges rufescens by pierre huber a better observer even than his celebrated father this ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves without their aid the species would certainly become extinct in a single year the males and fertile females do no work the workers or sterile females though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves do no other work they are incapable of making their own nests or of feeding their own larvг when the old nest is found inconvenient and they have to migrate it is the slaves which determine the migration and actually carry their masters in their jaws so utterly helpless are the masters that when huber shut up thirty of them without a slave but with plenty of the food which they like best and with their larvae and pupг to stimulate them to work they did nothing they could not even feed themselves and many perished of hunger huber then introduced a single slave f fusca and she instantly set to work fed and saved the survivors made some cells and tended the larvг and put all to rights what can be more extraordinary than these well ascertained facts if we had not known of any other slave making ant it would have been hopeless to have speculated how so wonderful an instinct could have been perfected another species formica sanguinea was likewise first discovered by p huber to be a slave making ant this species is found in the southern parts of england and its habits have been attended to by mr f smith of 220 the british museum to whom i am much indebted for information on this and other subjects although fully trusting to the statements of huber and mr smith i tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame of mind as any one may well be excused for doubting the truth of so extraordinary and odious an instinct as that of making slaves hence i will give the observations which i have myself made in some little detail i opened fourteen nests of f sanguinea and found a few slaves in all males and fertile females of the slave species f fusca are found only in their own proper communities and have never been observed in the nests of f sanguinea the slaves are black and not above half the size of their red masters so that the contrast in their appearance is very great when the nest is slightly disturbed the slaves occasionally come out and like their masters are much agitated and defend the nest when the nest is much disturbed and the larvг and pupг are exposed the slaves work energetically with their masters in carrying them away to a place of safety hence it is clear that the slaves feel quite at home during the months of june and july on three successive years i have watched for many hours several nests in surrey and sussex and never saw a slave either leave or enter a nest as during these months the slaves are very few in number i thought that they might behave differently when more numerous but mr smith informs me that he has watched the nests at various hours during may june and august both in surrey and hampshire and has never seen the slaves through present in large numbers in august either leave or enter the nest hence he considers them as strictly household slaves the masters on the other hand may be constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest and food of all kinds during the present year however in the month 221 of july i came across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves and i observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest and marching along the same road to a tall scotch fir tree twenty five yards distant which they ascended together probably in search of aphides or cocci according to huber who had ample opportunities for observation in switzerland the slaves habitually work with their masters in making the nest and they alone open and close the doors in the morning and evening and as huber expressly states their principal office is to search for aphides this difference in the usual habits of the masters and slaves in the two countries probably depends merely on the slaves being captured in greater numbers in switzerland than in england one day i fortunately witnessed a migration of f sanguinea from one nest to another and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the masters carefully carrying instead of being carried by as in the case of f rufescens their slaves in their jaws another day my attention was struck by about a score of the slave makers haunting the same spot and evidently not in search of food they approached and were vigorously repulsed by an independent community of the slave species f fusca sometimes as many as three of these ants clinging to the legs of the slave making f sanguinea the latter ruthlessly killed their small opponents and carried their dead bodies as food to their nest twenty nine yards distant but they were prevented from getting any pupг to rear as slaves i then dug up a small parcel of the pupг of f fusca from another nest and put them down on a bare spot near the place of combat they were eagerly seized and carried off by the tyrants who perhaps fancied that after all they had been victorious in their late combat 222 at the same time i laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupг of another species f flava with a few of these little yellow ants still clinging to the fragments of the nest this species is sometimes though rarely made into slaves as has been described by mr smith although so small a species it is very courageous and i have seen it ferociously attack other ants in one instance i found to my surprise an independent community of f flava under a stone beneath a nest of the slave making f sanguinea and when i had accidentally disturbed both nests the little ants attacked their big neighbours with surprising courage now i was curious to ascertain whether f sanguinea could distinguish the pupг of f fusca which they habitually make into slaves from those of the little and furious f flava which they rarely capture and it was evident that they did at once distinguish them for we have seen that they eagerly and instantly seized the pupг of f fusca whereas they were much terrified when they came across the pupг or even the earth from the nest of f flava and quickly ran away but in about a quarter of an hour shortly after all the little yellow ants had crawled away they took heart and carried off the pupг one evening i visited another community of f sanguinea and found a number of these ants returning home and entering their nests carrying the dead bodies of f fusca showing that it was not a migration and numerous pupг i traced a long file of ants burthened with booty for about forty yards to a very thick clump of heath whence i saw the last individual of f sanguinea emerge carrying a pupa but i was not able to find the desolated nest in the thick heath the nest however must have been close at hand for two or three individuals of f fusca were rushing about in the greatest 223 agitation and one was perched motionless with its own pupa in its mouth on the top of a spray of heath an image of despair over its ravaged home such are the facts though they did not need confirmation by me in regard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves let it be observed what a contrast the instinctive habits of f sanguinea present with those of the continental f rufescens the latter does not build its own nest does not determine its own migrations does not collect food for itself or its young and cannot even feed itself it is absolutely dependent on its numerous slaves formica sanguinea on the other hand possesses much fewer slaves and in the early part of the summer extremely few the masters determine when and where a new nest shall be formed and when they migrate the masters carry the slaves both in switzerland and england the slaves seem to have the exclusive care of the larvг and the masters alone go on slave making expeditions in switzerland the slaves and masters work together making and bringing materials for the nest both but chiefly the slaves tend and milk as it may be called their aphides and thus both collect food for the community in england the masters alone usually leave the nest to collect building materials and food for themselves their slaves and larvг so that the masters in this country receive much less service from their slaves than they do in switzerland by what steps the instinct of f sanguinea originated i will not pretend to conjecture but as ants which are not slave makers will as i have seen carry off pupг of other species if scattered near their nests it is possible that such pupг originally stored as food might become developed and the foreign ants thus unintentionally reared would then follow their proper instincts and do 224 what work they could if their presence proved useful to the species which had seized them if it were more advantageous to this species to capture workers than to procreate them the habit of collecting pupae originally for food might by natural selection be strengthened and rendered permanent for the very different purpose of raising slaves when the instinct was once acquired if carried out to a much less extent even than in our british f sanguinea which as we have seen is less aided by its slaves than the same species in switzerland i can see no difficulty in natural selection increasing and modifying the instinct always supposing each modification to be of use to the species until an ant was formed as abjectly dependent on its slaves as is the formica rufescens cell making instinct of the hive bee i will not here enter on minute details on this subject but will merely give an outline of the conclusions at which i have arrived he must be a dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb so beautifully adapted to its end without enthusiastic admiration we hear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a recondite problem and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold the greatest possible amount of honey with the least possible consumption of precious wax in their construction it has been remarked that a skilful workman with fitting tools and measures would find it very difficult to make cells of wax of the true form though this is perfectly effected by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive grant whatever instincts you please and it seems at first quite inconceivable how they can make all the necessary angles and planes or even perceive when they are correctly made but the difficulty is not 225 nearly so great as it at first appears all this beautiful work can be shown i think to follow from a few very simple instincts i was led to investigate this subject by mr waterhouse who has shown that the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of adjoining cells and the following view may perhaps be considered only as a modification of his theory let us look to the great principle of gradation and see whether nature does not reveal to us her method of work at one end of a short series we have humble bees which use their old cocoons to hold honey sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax and likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax at the other end of the series we have the cells of the hive bee placed in a double layer each cell as is well known is an hexagonal prism with the basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to fit on to a pyramid formed of three rhombs these rhombs have certain angles and the three which form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb enter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells on the opposite side in the series between the extreme perfection of the cells of the hive bee and the simplicity of those of the humble bee we have the cells of the mexican melipona domestica carefully described and figured by pierre huber the melipona itself is intermediate in structure between the hive and humble bee but more nearly related to the latter it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells in which the young are hatched and in addition some large cells of wax for holding honey these latter cells are nearly spherical and of nearly equal sizes and are aggregated into an irregular mass but the important point to notice is that these cells are always made at that degree of nearness to each other that they would have 226 intersected or broken into each other if the spheres had been completed but this is never permitted the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between the spheres which thus tend to intersect hence each cell consists of an outer spherical portion and of two three or more perfectly flat surfaces according as the cell adjoins two three or more other cells when one cell comes into contact with three other cells which from the spheres being nearly of the same size is very frequently and necessarily the case the three flat surfaces are united into a pyramid and this pyramid as huber has remarked is manifestly a gross imitation of the three sided pyramidal bases of the cell of the hive bee as in the cells of the hive bee so here the three plane surfaces in any one cell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells it is obvious that the melipona saves wax by this manner of building for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double but are of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions and yet each flat portion forms a part of two cells reflecting on this case it occurred to me that if the melipona had made its spheres at some given distance from each other and had made them of equal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer the resulting structure would probably have been as perfect as the comb of the hive bee accordingly i wrote to professor miller of cambridge and this geometer has kindly read over the following statement drawn up from his information and tells me that it is strictly correct if a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in two parallel layers with the centre of each sphere at the distance of radius г root 2 or radius г 1 41421 or at some lesser distance from the centres of the six surrounding spheres in the same 227 layer and at the same distance from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the other and parallel layer then if planes of intersection between the several spheres in both layers be formed there will result a double layer of hexagonal prisms united together by pyramidal bases formed of three rhombs and the rhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will have every angle identically the same with the best measurements which have been made of the cells of the hive bee hence we may safely conclude that if we could slightly modify the instincts already possessed by the melipona and in themselves not very wonderful this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as that of the hive bee we must suppose the melipona to make her cells truly spherical and of equal sizes and this would not be very surprising seeing that she already does so to a certain extent and seeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows in wood many insects can make apparently by turning round on a fixed point we must suppose the melipona to arrange her cells in level layers as she already does her cylindrical cells and we must further suppose and this is the greatest difficulty that she can somehow judge accurately at what distance to stand from her fellow labourers when several are making their spheres but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect largely and then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces we have further to suppose but this is no difficulty that after hexagonal prisms have been formed by the intersection of adjoining spheres in the same layer she can prolong the hexagon to any length requisite to hold the stock of honey in the same way as the rude humble bee adds cylinders of wax to the circular mouths of her old cocoons by such 228 modifications of instincts in themselves not very wonderful hardly more wonderful than those which guide a bird to make its nest i believe that the hive bee has acquired through natural selection her inimitable architectural powers but this theory can be tested by experiment following the example of mr tegetmeier i separated two combs and put between them a long thick square strip of wax the bees instantly began to excavate minute circular pits in it and as they deepened these little pits they made them wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins appearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere and of about the diameter of a cell it was most interesting to me to observe that wherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near together they had begun their work at such a distance from each other that by the time the basins had acquired the above stated width i e about the width of an ordinary cell and were in depth about one sixth of the diameter of the sphere of which they formed a part the rims of the basins intersected or broke into each other as soon as this occurred the bees ceased to excavate and began to build up flat walls of wax on the lines of intersection between the basins so that each hexagonal prism was built upon the scalloped edge of a smooth basin instead of on the straight edges of a three sided pyramid as in the case of ordinary cells i then put into the hive instead of a thick square piece of wax a thin and narrow knife edged ridge coloured with vermilion the bees instantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to each other in the same way as before but the ridge of wax was so thin that the bottoms of the basins if they had been excavated to the same depth as in the former 229 experiment would have broken into each other from the opposite sides the bees however did not suffer this to happen and they stopped their excavations in due time so that the basins as soon as they had been a little deepened came to have flat bottoms and these flat bottoms formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax having been left ungnawed were situated as far as the eye could judge exactly along the planes of imaginary intersection between the basins on the opposite sides of the ridge of wax in parts only little bits in other parts large portions of a rhombic plate had been left between the opposed basins but the work from the unnatural state of things had not been neatly performed the bees must have worked at very nearly the same rate on the opposite sides of the ridge of vermilion wax as they circularly gnawed away and deepened the basins on both sides in order to have succeeded in thus leaving flat plates between the basins by stopping work along the intermediate planes or planes of intersection considering how flexible thin wax is i do not see that there is any difficulty in the bees whilst at work on the two sides of a strip of wax perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper thinness and then stopping their work in ordinary combs it has appeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at exactly the same rate from the opposite sides for i have noticed half completed rhombs at the base of a just commenced cell which were slightly concave on one side where i suppose that the bees had excavated too quickly and convex on the opposed side where the bees had worked less quickly in one well marked instance i put the comb back into the hive and allowed the bees to go on working for a short time and again examined the cell and i found that the rhombic 230 plate had been completed and had become perfectly flat it was absolutely impossible from the extreme thinness of the little rhombic plate that they could have effected this by gnawing away the convex side and i suspect that the bees in such cases stand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and warm wax which as i have tried is easily done into its proper intermediate plane and thus flatten it from the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax we can clearly see that if the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax they could make their cells of the proper shape by standing at the proper distance from each other by excavating at the same rate and by endeavouring to make equal spherical hollows but never allowing the spheres to break into each other now bees as may be clearly seen by examining the edge of a growing comb do make a rough circumferential wall or rim all round the comb and they gnaw into this from the opposite sides always working circularly as they deepen each cell they do not make the whole three sided pyramidal base of any one cell at the same time but only the one rhombic plate which stands on the extreme growing margin or the two plates as the case may be and they never complete the upper edges of the rhombic plates until the hexagonal walls are commenced some of these statements differ from those made by the justly celebrated elder huber but i am convinced of their accuracy and if i had space i could show that they are conformable with my theory huber s statement that the very first cell is excavated out of a little parallel sided wall of wax is not as far as i have seen strictly correct the first commencement having always been a little hood of wax but i will not here enter on these details we see how important 231 a part excavation plays in the construction of the cells but it would be a great error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax in the proper position that is along the plane of intersection between two adjoining spheres i have several specimens showing clearly that they can do this even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of wax round a growing comb flexures may sometimes be observed corresponding in position to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells but the rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off by being largely gnawed away on both sides the manner in which the bees build is curious they always make the first rough wall from ten to twenty times thicker than the excessively thin finished wall of the cell which will ultimately be left we shall understand how they work by supposing masons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement and then to begin cutting it away equally on both sides near the ground till a smooth very thin wall is left in the middle the masons always piling up the cut away cement and adding fresh cement on the summit of the ridge we shall thus have a thin wall steadily growing upward but always crowned by a gigantic coping from all the cells both those just commenced and those completed being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax the bees can cluster and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicate hexagonal walls which are only about one four hundredth of an inch in thickness the plates of the pyramidal basis being about twice as thick by this singular manner of building strength is continually given to the comb with the utmost ultimate economy of wax it seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the cells are made that a multitude of bees all work together one bee after working a short time at one cell going to another so that as huber has stated 232 a score of individuals work even at the commencement of the first cell i was able practically to show this fact by covering the edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell or the extreme margin of the circumferential rim of a growing comb with an extremely thin layer of melted vermilion wax and i invariably found that the colour was most delicately diffused by the bees as delicately as a painter could have done with his brush by atoms of the coloured wax having been taken from the spot on which it had been placed and worked into the growing edges of the cells all round the work of construction seems to be a sort of balance struck between many bees all instinctively standing at the same relative distance from each other all trying to sweep equal spheres and then building up or leaving ungnawed the planes of intersection between these spheres it was really curious to note in cases of difficulty as when two pieces of comb met at an angle how often the bees would pull down and rebuild in different ways the same cell sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at first rejected when bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions for working for instance on a slip of wood placed directly under the middle of a comb growing downwards so that the comb has to be built over one face of the slip in this case the bees can lay the foundations of one wall of a new hexagon in its strictly proper place projecting beyond the other completed cells it suffices that the bees should be enabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each other and from the walls of the last completed cells and then by striking imaginary spheres they can build up a wall intermediate between two adjoining spheres but as far as i have seen they never gnaw away and finish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell and of 233 the adjoining cells has been built this capacity in bees of laying down under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper place between two just commenced cells is important as it bears on a fact which seems at first quite subversive of the foregoing theory namely that the cells on the extreme margin of wasp combs are sometimes strictly hexagonal but i have not space here to enter on this subject nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a single insect as in the case of a queen wasp making hexagonal cells if she work alternately on the inside and outside of two or three cells commenced at the same time always standing at the proper relative distance from the parts of the cells just begun sweeping spheres or cylinders and building up intermediate planes it is even conceivable that an insect might by fixing on a point at which to commence a cell and then moving outside first to one point and then to five other points at the proper relative distances from the central point and from each other strike the planes of intersection and so make an isolated hexagon but i am not aware that any such case has been observed nor would any good be derived from a single hexagon being built as in its construction more materials would be required than for a cylinder as natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight modifications of structure or instinct each profitable to the individual under its conditions of life it may reasonably be asked how a long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts all tending towards the present perfect plan of construction could have profited the progenitors of the hive bee i think the answer is not difficult it is known that bees are often hard pressed to get sufficient nectar and i am informed by mr tegetmeier that it has been experimentally found that no less than from twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar 234 are consumed by a hive of bees for the secretion of each pound of wax to that a prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collected and consumed by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the wax necessary for the construction of their combs moreover many bees have to remain idle for many days during the process of secretion a large store of honey is indispensable to support a large stock of bees during the winter and the security of the hive is known mainly to depend on a large number of bees being supported hence the saving of wax by largely saving honey must be a most important element of success in any family of bees of course the success of any species of bee may be dependent on the number of its parasites or other enemies or on quite distinct causes and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey which the bees could collect but let us suppose that this latter circumstance determined as it probably often does determine the numbers of a humble bee which could exist in a country and let us further suppose that the community lived throughout the winter and consequently required a store of honey there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our humble bee if a slight modification of her instinct led her to make her waxen cells near together so as to intersect a little for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells would save some little wax hence it would continually be more and more advantageous to our humble bee if she were to make her cells more and more regular nearer together and aggregated into a mass like the cells of the melipona for in this case a large part of the bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound other cells and much wax would be saved again from the same cause it would be advantageous to the melipona if she were to make her cells closer together and more regular in every way 235 than at present for then as we have seen the spherical surfaces would wholly disappear and would all be replaced by plane surfaces and the melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of the hive bee beyond this stage of perfection in architecture natural selection could not lead for the comb of the hive bee as far as we can see is absolutely perfect in economising wax thus as i believe the most wonderful of all known instincts that of the hive bee can be explained by natural selection having taken advantage of numerous successive slight modifications of simpler instincts natural selection having by slow degrees more and more perfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from each other in a double layer and to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection the bees of course no more knowing that they swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and of the basal rhombic plates the motive power of the process of natural selection having been economy of wax that individual swarm which wasted least honey in the secretion of wax having succeeded best and having transmitted by inheritance its newly acquired economical instinct to new swarms which in their turn will have had the best chance of succeeding in the struggle for existence no doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed to the theory of natural selection cases in which we cannot see how an instinct could possibly have originated cases in which no intermediate gradations are known to exist cases of instinct of apparently such trifling importance that they could 236 hardly have been acted on by natural selection cases of instincts almost identically the same in animals so remote in the scale of nature that we cannot account for their similarity by inheritance from a common parent and must therefore believe that they have been acquired by independent acts of natural selection i will not here enter on these several cases but will confine myself to one special difficulty which at first appeared to me insuperable and actually fatal to my whole theory i allude to the neuters or sterile females in insect communities for these neuters often differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males and fertile females and yet from being sterile they cannot propagate their kind the subject well deserves to be discussed at great length but i will here take only a single case that of working or sterile ants how the workers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty but not much greater than that of any other striking modification of structure for it can be shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state of nature occasionally become sterile and if such insects had been social and it had been profitable to the community that a number should have been annually born capable of work but incapable of procreation i can see no very great difficulty in this being effected by natural selection but i must pass over this preliminary difficulty the great difficulty lies in the working ants differing widely from both the males and the fertile females in structure as in the shape of the thorax and in being destitute of wings and sometimes of eyes and in instinct as far as instinct alone is concerned the prodigious difference in this respect between the workers and the perfect females would have been far better exemplified by the hive bee if a working ant or other neuter insect had been an animal 237 in the ordinary state i should have unhesitatingly assumed that all its characters had been slowly acquired through natural selection namely by an individual having been born with some slight profitable modification of structure this being inherited by its offspring which again varied and were again selected and so onwards but with the working ant we have an insect differing greatly from its parents yet absolutely sterile so that it could never have transmitted successively acquired modifications of structure or instinct to its progeny it may well be asked how is it possible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection first let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances both in our domestic productions and in those in a state of nature of all sorts of differences of structure which have become correlated to certain ages and to either sex we have differences correlated not only to one sex but to that short period alone when the reproductive system is active as in the nuptial plumage of many birds and in the hooked jaws of the male salmon we have even slight differences in the horns of different breeds of cattle in relation to an artificially imperfect state of the male sex for oxen of certain breeds have longer horns than in other breeds in comparison with the horns of the bulls or cows of these same breeds hence i can see no real difficulty in any character having become correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of insect communities the difficulty lies in understanding how such correlated modifications of structure could have been slowly accumulated by natural selection this difficulty though appearing insuperable is lessened or as i believe disappears when it is remembered that selection may be applied to the family as well as to the individual and may thus gain the 238 desired end thus a well flavoured vegetable is cooked and the individual is destroyed but the horticulturist sows seeds of the same stock and confidently expects to get nearly the same variety breeders of cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marbled together the animal has been slaughtered but the breeder goes with confidence to the same family i have such faith in the powers of selection that i do not doubt that a breed of cattle always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns could be slowly formed by carefully watching which individual bulls and cows when matched produced oxen with the longest horns and yet no one ox could ever have propagated its kind thus i believe it has been with social insects a slight modification of structure or instinct correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of the community has been advantageous to the community consequently the fertile males and females of the same community flourished and transmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency to produce sterile members having the same modification and i believe that this process has been repeated until that prodigious amount of difference between the fertile and sterile females of the same species has been produced which we see in many social insects but we have not as yet touched on the climax of the difficulty namely the fact that the neuters of several ants differ not only from the fertile females and males but from each other sometimes to an almost incredible degree and are thus divided into two or even three castes the castes moreover do not generally graduate into each other but are perfectly well defined being as distinct from each other as are any two species of the same genus or rather as any two genera of the same family thus in eciton there are working and soldier neuters with jaws and instincts extraordinarily 239 different in cryptocerus the workers of one caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads the use of which is quite unknown in the mexican myrmecocystus the workers of one caste never leave the nest they are fed by the workers of another caste and they have an enormously developed abdomen which secretes a sort of honey supplying the place of that excreted by the aphides or the domestic cattle as they may be called which our european ants guard or imprison it will indeed be thought that i have an overweening confidence in the principle of natural selection when i do not admit that such wonderful and well established facts at once annihilate my theory in the simpler case of neuter insects all of one caste or of the same kind which have been rendered by natural selection as i believe to be quite possible different from the fertile males and females in this case we may safely conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations that each successive slight profitable modification did not probably at first appear in all the individual neuters in the same nest but in a few alone and that by the long continued selection of the fertile parents which produced most neuters with the profitable modification all the neuters ultimately came to have the desired character on this view we ought occasionally to find neuter insects of the same species in the same nest presenting gradations of structure and this we do find even often considering how few neuter insects out of europe have been carefully examined mr f smith has shown how surprisingly the neuters of several british ants differ from each other in size and sometimes in colour and that the extreme forms can sometimes be perfectly linked together by individuals taken out of the same nest i have myself compared perfect gradations of this kind it often happens that the larger or the smaller sized workers 240 are the most numerous or that both large and small are numerous with those of an intermediate size scanty in numbers formica flava has larger and smaller workers with some of intermediate size and in this species as mr f smith has observed the larger workers have simple eyes ocelli which though small can be plainly distinguished whereas the smaller workers have their ocelli rudimentary having carefully dissected several specimens of these workers i can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the smaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionally lesser size and i fully believe though i dare not assert so positively that the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly intermediate condition so that we here have two bodies of sterile workers in the same nest differing not only in size but in their organs of vision yet connected by some few members in an intermediate condition i may digress by adding that if the smaller workers had been the most useful to the community and those males and females had been continually selected which produced more and more of the smaller workers until all the workers had come to be in this condition we should then have had a species of ant with neuters very nearly in the same condition with those of myrmica for the workers of myrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli though the male and female ants of this genus have well developed ocelli i may give one other case so confidently did i expect to find gradations in important points of structure between the different castes of neuters in the same species that i gladly availed myself of mr f smith s offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driver ant anomma of west africa the reader will perhaps best appreciate the amount of difference in these 241 workers by my giving not the actual measurements but a strictly accurate illustration the difference was the same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house of whom many were five feet four inches high and many sixteen feet high but we must suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead of three times as big as those of the smaller men and jaws nearly five times as big the jaws moreover of the working ants of the several sizes differed wonderfully in shape and in the form and number of the teeth but the important fact for us is that though the workers can be grouped into castes of different sizes yet they graduate insensibly into each other as does the widely different structure of their jaws i speak confidently on this latter point as mr lubbock made drawings for me with the camera lucida of the jaws which i had dissected from the workers of the several sizes with these facts before me i believe that natural selection by acting on the fertile parents could form a species which should regularly produce neuters either all of large size with one form of jaw or all of small size with jaws having a widely different structure or lastly and this is our climax of difficulty one set of workers of one size and structure and simultaneously another set of workers of a different size and structure a graduated series having been first formed as in the case of the driver ant and then the extreme forms from being the most useful to the community having been produced in greater and greater numbers through the natural selection of the parents which generated them until none with an intermediate structure were produced thus as i believe the wonderful fact of two distinctly defined castes of sterile workers existing in the same nest both widely different from each other and from 242 their parents has originated we can see how useful their production may have been to a social community of insects on the same principle that the division of labour is useful to civilised man as ants work by inherited instincts and by inherited organs or tools and not by acquired knowledge and manufactured instruments a perfect division of labour could be effected with them only by the workers being sterile for had they been fertile they would have intercrossed and their instincts and structure would have become blended and nature has as i believe effected this admirable division of labour in the communities of ants by the means of natural selection but i am bound to confess that with all my faith in this principle i should never have anticipated that natural selection could have been efficient in so high a degree had not the case of these neuter insects convinced me of the fact i have therefore discussed this case at some little but wholly insufficient length in order to show the power of natural selection and likewise because this is by far the most serious special difficulty which my theory has encountered the case also is very interesting as it proves that with animals as with plants any amount of modification in structure can be effected by the accumulation of numerous slight and as we must call them accidental variations which are in any manner profitable without exercise or habit having come into play for no amount of exercise or habit or volition in the utterly sterile members of a community could possibly affect the structure or instincts of the fertile members which alone leave descendants i am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrative case of neuter insects against the well known doctrine of lamarck summary i have endeavoured briefly in this chapter 243 to show that the mental qualities of our domestic animals vary and that the variations are inherited still more briefly i have attempted to show that instincts vary slightly in a state of nature no one will dispute that instincts are of the highest importance to each animal therefore i can see no difficulty under changing conditions of life in natural selection accumulating slight modifications of instinct to any extent in any useful direction in some cases habit or use and disuse have probably come into play i do not pretend that the facts given in this chapter strengthen in any great degree my theory but none of the cases of difficulty to the best of my judgment annihilate it on the other hand the fact that instincts are not always absolutely perfect and are liable to mistakes that no instinct has been produced for the exclusive good of other animals but that each animal takes advantage of the instincts of others that the canon in natural history of natura non facit saltum is applicable to instincts as well as to corporeal structure and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views but is otherwise inexplicable all tend to corroborate the theory of natural selection this theory is also strengthened by some few other facts in regard to instincts as by that common case of closely allied but certainly distinct species when inhabiting distant parts of the world and living under considerably different conditions of life yet often retaining nearly the same instincts for instance we can understand on the principle of inheritance how it is that the thrush of south america lines its nest with mud in the same peculiar manner as does our british thrush how it is that the male wrens troglodytes of north america build cock nests to roost in like the males of our distinct kitty wrens a habit wholly unlike that of 244 any other known bird finally it may not be a logical deduction but to my imagination it is far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckoo ejecting its foster brothers ants making slaves the larvae of ichneumonidг feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars not as specially endowed or created instincts but as small consequences of one general law leading to the advancement of all organic beings namely multiply vary let the strongest live and the weakest die 245 chapter viii hybridism distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids sterility various in degree not universal affected by close interbreeding removed by domestication laws governing the sterility of hybrids sterility not a special endowment but incidental on other differences causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids parallelism between the effects of changed conditions of life and crossing fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel offspring not universal hybrids and mongrels compared independently of their fertility summary the view generally entertained by naturalists is that species when intercrossed have been specially endowed with the quality of sterility in order to prevent the confusion of all organic forms this view certainly seems at first probable for species within the same country could hardly have kept distinct had they been capable of crossing freely the importance of the fact that hybrids are very generally sterile has i think been much underrated by some late writers on the theory of natural selection the case is especially important inasmuch as the sterility of hybrids could not possibly be of any advantage to them and therefore could not have been acquired by the continued preservation of successive profitable degrees of sterility i hope however to be able to show that sterility is not a specially acquired or endowed quality but is incidental on other acquired differences in treating this subject two classes of facts to a large extent fundamentally different have generally been confounded together namely the sterility of two species 246 when first crossed and the sterility of the hybrids produced from them pure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfect condition yet when intercrossed they produce either few or no offspring hybrids on the other hand have their reproductive organs functionally impotent as may be clearly seen in the state of the male element in both plants and animals though the organs themselves are perfect in structure as far as the microscope reveals in the first case the two sexual elements which go to form the embryo are perfect in the second case they are either not at all developed or are imperfectly developed this distinction is important when the cause of the sterility which is common to the two cases has to be considered the distinction has probably been slurred over owing to the sterility in both cases being looked on as a special endowment beyond the province of our reasoning powers the fertility of varieties that is of the forms known or believed to have descended from common parents when intercrossed and likewise the fertility of their mongrel offspring is on my theory of equal importance with the sterility of species for it seems to make a broad and clear distinction between varieties and species first for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybrid offspring it is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of those two conscientious and admirable observers kг lreuter and gг rtner who almost devoted their lives to this subject without being deeply impressed with the high generality of some degree of sterility kг lreuter makes the rule universal but then he cuts the knot for in ten cases in which he found two forms considered by most authors as distinct species quite fertile together he unhesitatingly ranks 247 them as varieties gг rtner also makes the rule equally universal and he disputes the entire fertility of kг lreuter s ten cases but in these and in many other cases gг rtner is obliged carefully to count the seeds in order to show that there is any degree of sterility he always compares the maximum number of seeds produced by two species when crossed and by their hybrid offspring with the average number produced by both pure parent species in a state of nature but a serious cause of error seems to me to be here introduced a plant to be hybridised must be castrated and what is often more important must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being brought to it by insects from other plants nearly all the plants experimentised on by gг rtner were potted and apparently were kept in a chamber in his house that these processes are often injurious to the fertility of a plant cannot be doubted for gг rtner gives in his table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated and artificially fertilised with their own pollen and excluding all cases such as the leguminosг in which there is an acknowledged difficulty in the manipulation half of these twenty plants had their fertility in some degree impaired moreover as gг rtner during several years repeatedly crossed the primrose and cowslip which we have such good reason to believe to be varieties and only once or twice succeeded in getting fertile seed as he found the common red and blue pimpernels anagallis arvensis and coerulea which the best botanists rank as varieties absolutely sterile together and as he came to the same conclusion in several other analogous cases it seems to me that we may well be permitted to doubt whether many other species are really so sterile when intercrossed as gг rtner believes 248 it is certain on the one hand that the sterility of various species when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly and on the other hand that the fertility of pure species is so easily affected by various circumstances that for all practical purposes it is most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins i think no better evidence of this can be required than that the two most experienced observers who have ever lived namely kг lreuter and gг rtner should have arrived at diametrically opposite conclusions in regard to the very same species it is also most instructive to compare but i have not space here to enter on details the evidence advanced by our best botanists on the question whether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or varieties with the evidence from fertility adduced by different hybridisers or by the same author from experiments made during different years it can thus be shown that neither sterility nor fertility affords any clear distinction between species and varieties but that the evidence from this source graduates away and is doubtful in the same degree as is the evidence derived from other constitutional and structural differences in regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations though gг rtner was enabled to rear some hybrids carefully guarding them from a cross with either pure parent for six or seven and in one case for ten generations yet he asserts positively that their fertility never increased but generally greatly decreased i do not doubt that this is usually the case and that the fertility often suddenly decreases in the first few generations nevertheless i believe that in all these experiments the fertility has been diminished by an independent cause namely from close interbreeding i have collected so large a body of facts showing 249 that close interbreeding lessens fertility and on the other hand that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases fertility that i cannot doubt the correctness of this almost universal belief amongst breeders hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers and as the parent species or other allied hybrids generally grow in the same garden the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the flowering season hence hybrids will generally be fertilised during each generation by their own individual pollen and i am convinced that this would be injurious to their fertility already lessened by their hybrid origin i am strengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedly made by gг rtner namely that if even the less fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind their fertility notwithstanding the frequent ill effects of manipulation sometimes decidedly increases and goes on increasing now in artificial fertilisation pollen is as often taken by chance as i know from my own experience from the anthers of another flower as from the anthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised so that a cross between two flowers though probably on the same plant would be thus effected moreover whenever complicated experiments are in progress so careful an observer as gг rtner would have castrated his hybrids and this would have insured in each generation a cross with a pollen from a distinct flower either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid nature and thus the strange fact of the increase of fertility in the successive generations of artificially fertilised hybrids may i believe be accounted for by close interbreeding having been avoided now let us turn to the results arrived at by the third most experienced hybridiser namely the hon and 250 rev w herbert he is as emphatic in his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile as fertile as the pure parent species as are kг lreuter and gг rtner that some degree of sterility between distinct species is a universal law of nature he experimentised on some of the very same species as did gг rtner the difference in their results may i think be in part accounted for by herbert s great horticultural skill and by his having hothouses at his command of his many important statements i will here give only a single one as an example namely that every ovule in a pod of crinum capense fertilised by c revolutum produced a plant which he says i never saw to occur in a case of its natural fecundation so that we here have perfect or even more than commonly perfect fertility in a first cross between two distinct species this case of the crinum leads me to refer to a most singular fact namely that there are individual plants of certain species of lobelia and of some other genera which can be far more easily fertilised by the pollen of another and distinct species than by their own pollen and all the individuals of nearly all the species of hippeastrum seem to be in this predicament for these plants have been found to yield seed to the pollen of a distinct species though quite sterile with their own pollen notwithstanding that their own pollen was found to be perfectly good for it fertilised distinct species so that certain individual plants and all the individuals of certain species can actually be hybridised much more readily than they can be self fertilised for instance a bulb of hippeastrum aulicum produced four flowers three were fertilised by herbert with their own pollen and the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the pollen of a compound hybrid descended from three other and distinct 251 species the result was that the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to grow and after a few days perished entirely whereas the pod impregnated by the pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid progress to maturity and bore good seed which vegetated freely in a letter to me in 1839 mr herbert told me that he had then tried the experiment during five years and he continued to try it during several subsequent years and always with the same result this result has also been confirmed by other observers in the case of hippeastrum with its sub genera and in the case of some other genera as lobelia passiflora and verbascum although the plants in these experiments appeared perfectly healthy and although both the ovules and pollen of the same flower were perfectly good with respect to other species yet as they were functionally imperfect in their mutual self action we must infer that the plants were in an unnatural state nevertheless these facts show on what slight and mysterious causes the lesser or greater fertility of species when crossed in comparison with the same species when self fertilised sometimes depends the practical experiments of horticulturists though not made with scientific precision deserve some notice it is notorious in how complicated a manner the species of pelargonium fuchsia calceolaria petunia rhododendron c have been crossed yet many of these hybrids seed freely for instance herbert asserts that a hybrid from calceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea species most widely dissimilar in general habit reproduced itself as perfectly as if it had been a natural species from the mountains of chile i have taken some pains to ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex crosses of rhododendrons and i am assured that many of them 252 are perfectly fertile mr c noble for instance informs me that he raises stocks for grafting from a hybrid between rhod ponticum and catawbiense and that this hybrid seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine had hybrids when fairly treated gone on decreasing in fertility in each successive generation as gг rtner believes to be the case the fact would have been notorious to nurserymen horticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrids and such alone are fairly treated for by insect agency the several individuals of the same hybrid variety are allowed to freely cross with each other and the injurious influence of close interbreeding is thus prevented any one may readily convince himself of the efficiency of insect agency by examining the flowers of the more sterile kinds of hybrid rhododendrons which produce no pollen for he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen brought from other flowers in regard to animals much fewer experiments have been carefully tried than with plants if our systematic arrangements can be trusted that is if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other as are the genera of plants then we may infer that animals more widely separated in the scale of nature can be more easily crossed than in the case of plants but the hybrids themselves are i think more sterile i doubt whether any case of a perfectly fertile hybrid animal can be considered as thoroughly well authenticated it should however be borne in mind that owing to few animals breeding freely under confinement few experiments have been fairly tried for instance the canary bird has been crossed with nine other finches but as not one of these nine species breeds freely in confinement we have no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the canary or that their hybrids 253 should be perfectly fertile again with respect to the fertility in successive generations of the more fertile hybrid animals i hardly know of an instance in which two families of the same hybrid have been raised at the same time from different parents so as to avoid the ill effects of close interbreeding on the contrary brothers and sisters have usually been crossed in each successive generation in opposition to the constantly repeated admonition of every breeder and in this case it is not at all surprising that the inherent sterility in the hybrids should have gone on increasing if we were to act thus and pair brothers and sisters in the case of any pure animal which from any cause had the least tendency to sterility the breed would assuredly be lost in a very few generations although i do not know of any thoroughly well authenticated cases of perfectly fertile hybrid animals i have some reason to believe that the hybrids from cervulus vaginalis and reevesii and from phasianus colchicus with p torquatus and with p versicolor are perfectly fertile there is no doubt that these three pheasants namely the common the true ring necked and the japan intercross and are becoming blended together in the woods of several parts of england the hybrids from the common and chinese geese a cygnoides species which are so different that they are generally ranked in distinct genera have often bred in this country with either pure parent and in one single instance they have bred inter se this was effected by mr eyton who raised two hybrids from the same parents but from different hatches and from these two birds he raised no less than eight hybrids grandchildren of the pure geese from one nest in india however these cross bred geese must be far more fertile for i am assured by two eminently capable judges namely 254 mr blyth and capt hutton that whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in various parts of the country and as they are kept for profit where neither pure parent species exists they must certainly be highly fertile a doctrine which originated with pallas has been largely accepted by modern naturalists namely that most of our domestic animals have descended from two or more wild species since commingled by intercrossing on this view the aboriginal species must either at first have produced quite fertile hybrids or the hybrids must have become in subsequent generations quite fertile under domestication this latter alternative seems to me the most probable and i am inclined to believe in its truth although it rests on no direct evidence i believe for instance that our dogs have descended from several wild stocks yet with perhaps the exception of certain indigenous domestic dogs of south america all are quite fertile together and analogy makes me greatly doubt whether the several aboriginal species would at first have freely bred together and have produced quite fertile hybrids so again there is reason to believe that our european and the humped indian cattle are quite fertile together but from facts communicated to me by mr blyth i think they must be considered as distinct species on this view of the origin of many of our domestic animals we must either give up the belief of the almost universal sterility of distinct species of animals when crossed or we must look at sterility not as an indelible characteristic but as one capable of being removed by domestication finally looking to all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of plants and animals it may be concluded that some degree of sterility both in first crosses 255 and in hybrids is an extremely general result but that it cannot under our present state of knowledge be considered as absolutely universal laws governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids we will now consider a little more in detail the circumstances and rules governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids our chief object will be to see whether or not the rules indicate that species have specially been endowed with this quality in order to prevent their crossing and blending together in utter confusion the following rules and conclusions are chiefly drawn up from gг rtner s admirable work on the hybridisation of plants i have taken much pains to ascertain how far the rules apply to animals and considering how scanty our knowledge is in regard to hybrid animals i have been surprised to find how generally the same rules apply to both kingdoms it has been already remarked that the degree of fertility both of first crosses and of hybrids graduates from zero to perfect fertility it is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown to exist but only the barest outline of the facts can here be given when pollen from a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant of a distinct family it exerts no more influence than so much inorganic dust from this absolute zero of fertility the pollen of different species of the same genus applied to the stigma of some one species yields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced up to nearly complete or even quite complete fertility and as we have seen in certain abnormal cases even to an excess of fertility beyond that which the plant s own pollen will produce so in hybrids themselves there are some which never have produced and probably never would produce even 256 with the pollen of either pure parent a single fertile seed but in some of these cases a first trace of fertility may be detected by the pollen of one of the pure parent species causing the flower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would have done and the early withering of the flower is well known to be a sign of incipient fertilisation from this extreme degree of sterility we have self fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number of seeds up to perfect fertility hybrids from two species which are very difficult to cross and which rarely produce any offspring are generally very sterile but the parallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross and the sterility of the hybrids thus produced two classes of facts which are generally confounded together is by no means strict there are many cases in which two pure species can be united with unusual facility and produce numerous hybrid offspring yet these hybrids are remarkably sterile on the other hand there are species which can be crossed very rarely or with extreme difficulty but the hybrids when at last produced are very fertile even within the limits of the same genus for instance in dianthus these two opposite cases occur the fertility both of first crosses and of hybrids is more easily affected by unfavourable conditions than is the fertility of pure species but the degree of fertility is likewise innately variable for it is not always the same when the same two species are crossed under the same circumstances but depends in part upon the constitution of the individuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment so it is with hybrids for their degree of fertility is often found to differ greatly in the several individuals raised from seed out of the same capsule and exposed to exactly the same conditions 257 by the term systematic affinity is meant the resemblance between species in structure and in constitution more especially in the structure of parts which are of high physiological importance and which differ little in the allied species now the fertility of first crosses between species and of the hybrids produced from them is largely governed by their systematic affinity this is clearly shown by hybrids never having been raised between species ranked by systematists in distinct families and on the other hand by very closely allied species generally uniting with facility but the correspondence between systematic affinity and the facility of crossing is by no means strict a multitude of cases could be given of very closely allied species which will not unite or only with extreme difficulty and on the other hand of very distinct species which unite with the utmost facility in the same family there may be a genus as dianthus in which very many species can most readily be crossed and another genus as silene in which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce between extremely close species a single hybrid even within the limits of the same genus we meet with this same difference for instance the many species of nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species of almost any other genus but gг rtner found that n acuminata which is not a particularly distinct species obstinately failed to fertilise or to be fertilised by no less than eight other species of nicotiana very many analogous facts could be given no one has been able to point out what kind or what amount of difference in any recognisable character is sufficient to prevent two species crossing it can be shown that plants most widely different in habit and general appearance and having strongly marked 258 differences in every part of the flower even in the pollen in the fruit and in the cotyledons can be crossed annual and perennial plants deciduous and evergreen trees plants inhabiting different stations and fitted for extremely different climates can often be crossed with ease by a reciprocal cross between two species i mean the case for instance of a stallion horse being first crossed with a female ass and then a male ass with a mare these two species may then be said to have been reciprocally crossed there is often the widest possible difference in the facility of making reciprocal crosses such cases are highly important for they prove that the capacity in any two species to cross is often completely independent of their systematic affinity or of any recognisable difference in their whole organisation on the other hand these cases clearly show that the capacity for crossing is connected with constitutional differences imperceptible by us and confined to the reproductive system this difference in the result of reciprocal crosses between the same two species was long ago observed by kг lreuter to give an instance mirabilis jalapa can easily be fertilised by the pollen of m longiflora and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile but kг lreuter tried more than two hundred times during eight following years to fertilise reciprocally m longiflora with the pollen of m jalapa and utterly failed several other equally striking cases could be given thuret has observed the same fact with certain sea weeds or fuci gг rtner moreover found that this difference of facility in making reciprocal crosses is extremely common in a lesser degree he has observed it even between forms so closely related as matthiola annua and glabra that many botanists rank them only as varieties it is also a remarkable fact that hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses though 259 of course compounded of the very same two species the one species having first been used as the father and then as the mother generally differ in fertility in a small and occasionally in a high degree several other singular rules could be given from gг rtner for instance some species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species other species of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressing their likeness on their hybrid offspring but these two powers do not at all necessarily go together there are certain hybrids which instead of having as is usual an intermediate character between their two parents always closely resemble one of them and such hybrids though externally so like one of their pure parent species are with rare exceptions extremely sterile so again amongst hybrids which are usually intermediate in structure between their parents exceptional and abnormal individuals sometimes are born which closely resemble one of their pure parents and these hybrids are almost always utterly sterile even when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same capsule have a considerable degree of fertility these facts show how completely fertility in the hybrid is independent of its external resemblance to either pure parent considering the several rules now given which govern the fertility of first crosses and of hybrids we see that when forms which must be considered as good and distinct species are united their fertility graduates from zero to perfect fertility or even to fertility under certain conditions in excess that their fertility besides being eminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions is innately variable that it is by no means always the same in degree in the first cross and in the hybrids produced 260 from this cross that the fertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemble in external appearance either parent and lastly that the facility of making a first cross between any two species is not always governed by their systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each other this latter statement is clearly proved by reciprocal crosses between the same two species for according as the one species or the other is used as the father or the mother there is generally some difference and occasionally the widest possible difference in the facility of effecting an union the hybrids moreover produced from reciprocal crosses often differ in fertility now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have been endowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confounded in nature i think not for why should the sterility be so extremely different in degree when various species are crossed all of which we must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blending together why should the degree of sterility be innately variable in the individuals of the same species why should some species cross with facility and yet produce very sterile hybrids and other species cross with extreme difficulty and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids why should there often be so great a difference in the result of a reciprocal cross between the same two species why it may even be asked has the production of hybrids been permitted to grant to species the special power of producing hybrids and then to stop their further propagation by different degrees of sterility not strictly related to the facility of the first union between their parents seems to be a strange arrangement the foregoing rules and facts on the other hand 261 appear to me clearly to indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of hybrids is simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences chiefly in the reproductive systems of the species which are crossed the differences being of so peculiar and limited a nature that in reciprocal crosses between two species the male sexual element of the one will often freely act on the female sexual element of the other but not in a reversed direction it will be advisable to explain a little more fully by an example what i mean by sterility being incidental on other differences and not a specially endowed quality as the capacity of one plant to be grafted or budded on another is so entirely unimportant for its welfare in a state of nature i presume that no one will suppose that this capacity is a specially endowed quality but will admit that it is incidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two plants we can sometimes see the reason why one tree will not take on another from differences in their rate of growth in the hardness of their wood in the period of the flow or nature of their sap c but in a multitude of cases we can assign no reason whatever great diversity in the size of two plants one being woody and the other herbaceous one being evergreen and the other deciduous and adaptation to widely different climates does not always prevent the two grafting together as in hybridisation so with grafting the capacity is limited by systematic affinity for no one has been able to graft trees together belonging to quite distinct families and on the other hand closely allied species and varieties of the same species can usually but not invariably be grafted with ease but this capacity as in hybridisation is by no means absolutely governed by systematic affinity although many distinct genera within the same family have been grafted 262 together in other cases species of the same genus will not take on each other the pear can be grafted far more readily on the quince which is ranked as a distinct genus than on the apple which is a member of the same genus even different varieties of the pear take with different degrees of facility on the quince so do different varieties of the apricot and peach on certain varieties of the plum as gг rtner found that there was sometimes an innate difference in different individuals of the same two species in crossing so sagaret believes this to be the case with different individuals of the same two species in being grafted together as in reciprocal crosses the facility of effecting an union is often very far from equal so it sometimes is in grafting the common gooseberry for instance cannot be grafted on the currant whereas the currant will take though with difficulty on the gooseberry we have seen that the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive organs in an imperfect condition is a very different case from the difficulty of uniting two pure species which have their reproductive organs perfect yet these two distinct cases run to a certain extent parallel something analogous occurs in grafting for thouin found that three species of robinia which seeded freely on their own roots and which could be grafted with no great difficulty on another species when thus grafted were rendered barren on the other hand certain species of sorbus when grafted on other species yielded twice as much fruit as when on their own roots we are reminded by this latter fact of the extraordinary case of hippeastrum lobelia c which seeded much more freely when fertilised with the pollen of distinct species than when self fertilised with their own pollen 263 we thus see that although there is a clear and fundamental difference between the mere adhesion of grafted stocks and the union of the male and female elements in the act of reproduction yet that there is a rude degree of parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossing distinct species and as we must look at the curious and complex laws governing the facility with which trees can be grafted on each other as incidental on unknown differences in their vegetative systems so i believe that the still more complex laws governing the facility of first crosses are incidental on unknown differences chiefly in their reproductive systems these differences in both cases follow to a certain extent as might have been expected systematic affinity by which every kind of resemblance and dissimilarity between organic beings is attempted to be expressed the facts by no means seem to me to indicate that the greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting or crossing together various species has been a special endowment although in the case of crossing the difficulty is as important for the endurance and stability of specific forms as in the case of grafting it is unimportant for their welfare causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids we may now look a little closer at the probable causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids these two cases are fundamentally different for as just remarked in the union of two pure species the male and female sexual elements are perfect whereas in hybrids they are imperfect even in first crosses the greater or lesser difficulty in effecting a union apparently depends on several distinct causes there must sometimes be a physical impossibility in the male element reaching the ovule as would be the case with a plant 264 having a pistil too long for the pollen tubes to reach the ovarium it has also been observed that when pollen of one species is placed on the stigma of a distantly allied species though the pollen tubes protrude they do not penetrate the stigmatic surface again the male element may reach the female element but be incapable of causing an embryo to be developed as seems to have been the case with some of thuret s experiments on fuci no explanation can be given of these facts any more than why certain trees cannot be grafted on others lastly an embryo may be developed and then perish at an early period this latter alternative has not been sufficiently attended to but i believe from observations communicated to me by mr hewitt who has had great experience in hybridising gallinaceous birds that the early death of the embryo is a very frequent cause of sterility in first crosses i was at first very unwilling to believe in this view as hybrids when once born are generally healthy and long lived as we see in the case of the common mule hybrids however are differently circumstanced before and after birth when born and living in a country where their two parents can live they are generally placed under suitable conditions of life but a hybrid partakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its mother and therefore before birth as long as it is nourished within its mother s womb or within the egg or seed produced by the mother it may be exposed to conditions in some degree unsuitable and consequently be liable to perish at an early period more especially as all very young beings seem eminently sensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life in regard to the sterility of hybrids in which the sexual elements are imperfectly developed the case is 265 very different i have more than once alluded to a large body of facts which i have collected showing that when animals and plants are removed from their natural conditions they are extremely liable to have their reproductive systems seriously affected this in fact is the great bar to the domestication of animals between the sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids there are many points of similarity in both cases the sterility is independent of general health and is often accompanied by excess of size or great luxuriance in both cases the sterility occurs in various degrees in both the male element is the most liable to be affected but sometimes the female more than the male in both the tendency goes to a certain extent with systematic affinity for whole groups of animals and plants are rendered impotent by the same unnatural conditions and whole groups of species tend to produce sterile hybrids on the other hand one species in a group will sometimes resist great changes of conditions with unimpaired fertility and certain species in a group will produce unusually fertile hybrids no one can tell till he tries whether any particular animal will breed under confinement or any exotic plant seed freely under culture nor can he tell till he tries whether any two species of a genus will produce more or less sterile hybrids lastly when organic beings are placed during several generations under conditions not natural to them they are extremely liable to vary which is due as i believe to their reproductive systems having been specially affected though in a lesser degree than when sterility ensues so it is with hybrids for hybrids in successive generations are eminently liable to vary as every experimentalist has observed thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnatural conditions and when hybrids 266 are produced by the unnatural crossing of two species the reproductive system independently of the general state of health is affected by sterility in a very similar manner in the one case the conditions of life have been disturbed though often in so slight a degree as to be inappreciable by us in the other case or that of hybrids the external conditions have remained the same but the organisation has been disturbed by two different structures and constitutions having been blended into one for it is scarcely possible that two organisations should be compounded into one without some disturbance occurring in the development or periodical action or mutual relation of the different parts and organs one to another or to the conditions of life when hybrids are able to breed inter se they transmit to their offspring from generation to generation the same compounded organisation and hence we need not be surprised that their sterility though in some degree variable rarely diminishes it must however be confessed that we cannot understand excepting on vague hypotheses several facts with respect to the sterility of hybrids for instance the unequal fertility of hybrids produced from reciprocal crosses or the increased sterility in those hybrids which occasionally and exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent nor do i pretend that the foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter no explanation is offered why an organism when placed under unnatural conditions is rendered sterile all that i have attempted to show is that in two cases in some respects allied sterility is the common result in the one case from the conditions of life having been disturbed in the other case from the organisation having been disturbed by two organisations having been compounded into one it may seem fanciful but i suspect that a similar 267 parallelism extends to an allied yet very different class of facts it is an old and almost universal belief founded i think on a considerable body of evidence that slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to all living things we see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in their frequent exchanges of seed tubers c from one soil or climate to another and back again during the convalescence of animals we plainly see that great benefit is derived from almost any change in the habits of life again both with plants and animals there is abundant evidence that a cross between very distinct individuals of the same species that is between members of different strains or sub breeds gives vigour and fertility to the offspring i believe indeed from the facts alluded to in our fourth chapter that a certain amount of crossing is indispensable even with hermaphrodites and that close interbreeding continued during several generations between the nearest relations especially if these be kept under the same conditions of life always induces weakness and sterility in the progeny hence it seems that on the one hand slight changes in the conditions of life benefit all organic beings and on the other hand that slight crosses that is crosses between the males and females of the same species which have varied and become slightly different give vigour and fertility to the offspring but we have seen that greater changes or changes of a particular nature often render organic beings in some degree sterile and that greater crosses that is crosses between males and females which have become widely or specifically different produce hybrids which are generally sterile in some degree i cannot persuade myself that this parallelism is an accident or an illusion both series of facts seem to be connected together by some 268 common but unknown bond which is essentially related to the principle of life fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel offspring it may be urged as a most forcible argument that there must be some essential distinction between species and varieties and that there must be some error in all the foregoing remarks inasmuch as varieties however much they may differ from each other in external appearance cross with perfect facility and yield perfectly fertile offspring i fully admit that this is almost invariably the case but if we look to varieties produced under nature we are immediately involved in hopeless difficulties for if two hitherto reputed varieties be found in any degree sterile together they are at once ranked by most naturalists as species for instance the blue and red pimpernel the primrose and cowslip which are considered by many of our best botanists as varieties are said by gг rtner not to be quite fertile when crossed and he consequently ranks them as undoubted species if we thus argue in a circle the fertility of all varieties produced under nature will assuredly have to be granted if we turn to varieties produced or supposed to have been produced under domestication we are still involved in doubt for when it is stated for instance that the german spitz dog unites more easily than other dogs with foxes or that certain south american indigenous domestic dogs do not readily cross with european dogs the explanation which will occur to every one and probably the true one is that these dogs have descended from several aboriginally distinct species nevertheless the perfect fertility of so many domestic varieties differing widely from each other in appearance for instance of the pigeon or of the cabbage is 269 a remarkable fact more especially when we reflect how many species there are which though resembling each other most closely are utterly sterile when intercrossed several considerations however render the fertility of domestic varieties less remarkable than at first appears it can in the first place be clearly shown that mere external dissimilarity between two species does not determine their greater or lesser degree of sterility when crossed and we may apply the same rule to domestic varieties in the second place some eminent naturalists believe that a long course of domestication tends to eliminate sterility in the successive generations of hybrids which were at first only slightly sterile and if this be so we surely ought not to expect to find sterility both appearing and disappearing under nearly the same conditions of life lastly and this seems to me by far the most important consideration new races of animals and plants are produced under domestication by man s methodical and unconscious power of selection for his own use and pleasure he neither wishes to select nor could select slight differences in the reproductive system or other constitutional differences correlated with the reproductive system he supplies his several varieties with the same food treats them in nearly the same manner and does not wish to alter their general habits of life nature acts uniformly and slowly during vast periods of time on the whole organisation in any way which may be for each creature s own good and thus she may either directly or more probably indirectly through correlation modify the reproductive system in the several descendants from any one species seeing this difference in the process of selection as carried on by man and nature we need not be surprised at some difference in the result i have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same 270 species were invariably fertile when intercrossed but it seems to me impossible to resist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility in the few following cases which i will briefly abstract the evidence is at least as good as that from which we believe in the sterility of a multitude of species the evidence is also derived from hostile witnesses who in all other cases consider fertility and sterility as safe criterions of specific distinction gг rtner kept during several years a dwarf kind of maize with yellow seeds and a tall variety with red seeds growing near each other in his garden and although these plants have separated sexes they never naturally crossed he then fertilised thirteen flowers of the one with the pollen of the other but only a single head produced any seed and this one head produced only five grains manipulation in this case could not have been injurious as the plants have separated sexes no one i believe has suspected that these varieties of maize are distinct species and it is important to notice that the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves perfectly fertile so that even gг rtner did not venture to consider the two varieties as specifically distinct girou de buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd which like the maize has separated sexes and he asserts that their mutual fertilisation is by so much the less easy as their differences are greater how far these experiments may be trusted i know not but the forms experimentised on are ranked by sagaret who mainly founds his classification by the test of infertility as varieties the following case is far more remarkable and seems at first quite incredible but it is the result of an astonishing number of experiments made during many years on nine species of verbascum by so good an observer 271 and so hostile a witness as gг rtner namely that yellow and white varieties of the same species of verbascum when intercrossed produce less seed than do either coloured varieties when fertilised with pollen from their own coloured flowers moreover he asserts that when yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with yellow and white varieties of a distinct species more seed is produced by the crosses between the similarly coloured flowers than between those which are differently coloured yet these varieties of verbascum present no other difference besides the mere colour of the flower and one variety can sometimes be raised from the seed of the other from observations which i have made on certain varieties of hollyhock i am inclined to suspect that they present analogous facts kг lreuter whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequent observer has proved the remarkable fact that one variety of the common tobacco is more fertile when crossed with a widely distinct species than are the other varieties he experimentised on five forms which are commonly reputed to be varieties and which he tested by the severest trial namely by reciprocal crosses and he found their mongrel offspring perfectly fertile but one of these five varieties when used either as father or mother and crossed with the nicotiana glutinosa always yielded hybrids not so sterile as those which were produced from the four other varieties when crossed with n glutinosa hence the reproductive system of this one variety must have been in some manner and in some degree modified from these facts from the great difficulty of ascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature for a supposed variety if infertile in any degree would generally be ranked as species from man selecting only 272 external characters in the production of the most distinct domestic varieties and from not wishing or being able to produce recondite and functional differences in the reproductive system from these several considerations and facts i do not think that the very general fertility of varieties can be proved to be of universal occurrence or to form a fundamental distinction between varieties and species the general fertility of varieties does not seem to me sufficient to overthrow the view which i have taken with respect to the very general but not invariable sterility of first crosses and of hybrids namely that it is not a special endowment but is incidental on slowly acquired modifications more especially in the reproductive systems of the forms which are crossed hybrids and mongrels compared independently of their fertility independently of the question of fertility the offspring of species when crossed and of varieties when crossed may be compared in several other respects gг rtner whose strong wish was to draw a marked line of distinction between species and varieties could find very few and as it seems to me quite unimportant differences between the so called hybrid offspring of species and the so called mongrel offspring of varieties and on the other hand they agree most closely in very many important respects i shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity the most important distinction is that in the first generation mongrels are more variable than hybrids but gг rtner admits that hybrids from species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first generation and i have myself seen striking instances of this fact gг rtner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species are more variable 273 than those from very distinct species and this shows that the difference in the degree of variability graduates away when mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several generations an extreme amount of variability in their offspring is notorious but some few cases both of hybrids and mongrels long retaining uniformity of character could be given the variability however in the successive generations of mongrels is perhaps greater than in hybrids this greater variability of mongrels than of hybrids does not seem to me at all surprising for the parents of mongrels are varieties and mostly domestic varieties very few experiments having been tried on natural varieties and this implies in most cases that there has been recent variability and therefore we might expect that such variability would often continue and be superadded to that arising from the mere act of crossing the slight degree of variability in hybrids from the first cross or in the first generation in contrast with their extreme variability in the succeeding generations is a curious fact and deserves attention for it bears on and corroborates the view which i have taken on the cause of ordinary variability namely that it is due to the reproductive system being eminently sensitive to any change in the conditions of life being thus often rendered either impotent or at least incapable of its proper function of producing offspring identical with the parent form now hybrids in the first generation are descended from species excluding those long cultivated which have not had their reproductive systems in any way affected and they are not variable but hybrids themselves have their reproductive systems seriously affected and their descendants are highly variable but to return to our comparison of mongrels and 274 hybrids gг rtner states that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to either parent form but this if it be true is certainly only a difference in degree gг rtner further insists that when any two species although most closely allied to each other are crossed with a third species the hybrids are widely different from each other whereas if two very distinct varieties of one species are crossed with another species the hybrids do not differ much but this conclusion as far as i can make out is founded on a single experiment and seems directly opposed to the results of several experiments made by kг lreuter these alone are the unimportant differences which gг rtner is able to point out between hybrid and mongrel plants on the other hand the resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their respective parents more especially in hybrids produced from nearly related species follows according to gг rtner the same laws when two species are crossed one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing its likeness on the hybrid and so i believe it to be with varieties of plants with animals one variety certainly often has this prepotent power over another variety hybrid plants produced from a reciprocal cross generally resemble each other closely and so it is with mongrels from a reciprocal cross both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced to either pure parent form by repeated crosses in successive generations with either parent these several remarks are apparently applicable to animals but the subject is here excessively complicated partly owing to the existence of secondary sexual characters but more especially owing to prepotency in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in the other both when one species is crossed with another and when one variety is crossed with 275 another variety for instance i think those authors are right who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over the horse so that both the mule and the hinny more resemble the ass than the horse but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the male ass than in the female so that the mule which is the offspring of the male ass and mare is more like an ass than is the hinny which is the offspring of the female ass and stallion much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact that mongrel animals alone are born closely like one of their parents but it can be shown that this does sometimes occur with hybrids yet i grant much less frequently with hybrids than with mongrels looking to the cases which i have collected of cross bred animals closely resembling one parent the resemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almost monstrous in their nature and which have suddenly appeared such as albinism melanism deficiency of tail or horns or additional fingers and toes and do not relate to characters which have been slowly acquired by selection consequently sudden reversions to the perfect character of either parent would be more likely to occur with mongrels which are descended from varieties often suddenly produced and semi monstrous in character than with hybrids which are descended from species slowly and naturally produced on the whole i entirely agree with dr prosper lucas who after arranging an enormous body of facts with respect to animals comes to the conclusion that the laws of resemblance of the child to its parents are the same whether the two parents differ much or little from each other namely in the union of individuals of the same variety or of different varieties or of distinct species laying aside the question of fertility and sterility 276 in all other respects there seems to be a general and close similarity in the offspring of crossed species and of crossed varieties if we look at species as having been specially created and at varieties as having been produced by secondary laws this similarity would be an astonishing fact but it harmonises perfectly with the view that there is no essential distinction between species and varieties summary of chapter first crosses between forms sufficiently distinct to be ranked as species and their hybrids are very generally but not universally sterile the sterility is of all degrees and is often so slight that the two most careful experimentalists who have ever lived have come to diametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test the sterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species and is eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions the degree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity but is governed by several curious and complex laws it is generally different and sometimes widely different in reciprocal crosses between the same two species it is not always equal in degree in a first cross and in the hybrid produced from this cross in the same manner as in grafting trees the capacity of one species or variety to take on another is incidental on generally unknown differences in their vegetative systems so in crossing the greater or less facility of one species to unite with another is incidental on unknown differences in their reproductive systems there is no more reason to think that species have been specially endowed with various degrees of sterility to prevent them crossing and blending in nature than to think that trees have been specially endowed with various and 277 somewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together in order to prevent them becoming inarched in our forests the sterility of first crosses between pure species which have their reproductive systems perfect seems to depend on several circumstances in some cases largely on the early death of the embryo the sterility of hybrids which have their reproductive systems imperfect and which have had this system and their whole organisation disturbed by being compounded of two distinct species seems closely allied to that sterility which so frequently affects pure species when their natural conditions of life have been disturbed this view is supported by a parallelism of another kind namely that the crossing of forms only slightly different is favourable to the vigour and fertility of their offspring and that slight changes in the conditions of life are apparently favourable to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings it is not surprising that the degree of difficulty in uniting two species and the degree of sterility of their hybrid offspring should generally correspond though due to distinct causes for both depend on the amount of difference of some kind between the species which are crossed nor is it surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross the fertility of the hybrids produced from it and the capacity of being grafted together though this latter capacity evidently depends on widely different circumstances should all run to a certain extent parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which are subjected to experiment for systematic affinity attempts to express all kinds of resemblance between all species first crosses between forms known to be varieties or sufficiently alike to be considered as varieties and their mongrel offspring are very generally but not quite 278 universally fertile nor is this nearly general and perfect fertility surprising when we remember how liable we are to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature and when we remember that the greater number of varieties have been produced under domestication by the selection of mere external differences and not of differences in the reproductive system in all other respects excluding fertility there is a close general resemblance between hybrids and mongrels finally then the facts briefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to but even rather to support the view that there is no fundamental distinction between species and varieties 279 chapter ix on the imperfection of the geological record on the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day on the nature of extinct intermediate varieties on their number on the vast lapse of time as inferred from the rate of deposition and of denudation on the poorness of our palг ontological collections on the intermittence of geological formations on the absence of intermediate varieties in any one formation on the sudden appearance of groups of species on their sudden appearance in the lowest known fossiliferous strata in the sixth chapter i enumerated the chief objections which might be justly urged against the views maintained in this volume most of them have now been discussed one namely the distinctness of specific forms and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links is a very obvious difficulty i assigned reasons why such links do not commonly occur at the present day under the circumstances apparently most favourable for their presence namely on an extensive and continuous area with graduated physical conditions i endeavoured to show that the life of each species depends in a more important manner on the presence of other already defined organic forms than on climate and therefore that the really governing conditions of life do not graduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture i endeavoured also to show that intermediate varieties from existing in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect will generally be beaten out and exterminated during the course of further modification and improvement the main cause however of innumerable intermediate links not now occurring everywhere throughout nature 280 depends on the very process of natural selection through which new varieties continually take the places of and exterminate their parent forms but just in proportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormous scale so must the number of intermediate varieties which have formerly existed on the earth be truly enormous why then is not every geological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organic chain and this perhaps is the most obvious and gravest objection which can be urged against my theory the explanation lies as i believe in the extreme imperfection of the geological record in the first place it should always be borne in mind what sort of intermediate forms must on my theory have formerly existed i have found it difficult when looking at any two species to avoid picturing to myself forms directly intermediate between them but this is a wholly false view we should always look for forms intermediate between each species and a common but unknown progenitor and the progenitor will generally have differed in some respects from all its modified descendants to give a simple illustration the fantail and pouter pigeons have both descended from the rock pigeon if we possessed all the intermediate varieties which have ever existed we should have an extremely close series between both and the rock pigeon but we should have no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter none for instance combining a tail somewhat expanded with a crop somewhat enlarged the characteristic features of these two breeds these two breeds moreover have become so much modified that if we had no historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin it would not have been possible to have 281 determined from a mere comparison of their structure with that of the rock pigeon whether they had descended from this species or from some other allied species such as c oenas so with natural species if we look to forms very distinct for instance to the horse and tapir we have no reason to suppose that links ever existed directly intermediate between them but between each and an unknown common parent the common parent will have had in its whole organisation much general resemblance to the tapir and to the horse but in some points of structure may have differed considerably from both even perhaps more than they differ from each other hence in all such cases we should be unable to recognise the parent form of any two or more species even if we closely compared the structure of the parent with that of its modified descendants unless at the same time we had a nearly perfect chain of the intermediate links it is just possible by my theory that one of two living forms might have descended from the other for instance a horse from a tapir and in this case direct intermediate links will have existed between them but such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very long period unaltered whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount of change and the principle of competition between organism and organism between child and parent will render this a very rare event for in all cases the new and improved forms of life tend to supplant the old and unimproved forms by the theory of natural selection all living species have been connected with the parent species of each genus by differences not greater than we see between the varieties of the same species at the present 282 day and these parent species now generally extinct have in their turn been similarly connected with more ancient species and so on backwards always converging to the common ancestor of each great class so that the number of intermediate and transitional links between all living and extinct species must have been inconceivably great but assuredly if this theory be true such have lived upon this earth on the lapse of time independently of our not finding fossil remains of such infinitely numerous connecting links it may be objected that time will not have sufficed for so great an amount of organic change all changes having been effected very slowly through natural selection it is hardly possible for me even to recall to the reader who may not be a practical geologist the facts leading the mind feebly to comprehend the lapse of time he who can read sir charles lyell s grand work on the principles of geology which the future historian will recognise as having produced a revolution in natural science yet does not admit how incomprehensively vast have been the past periods of time may at once close this volume not that it suffices to study the principles of geology or to read special treatises by different observers on separate formations and to mark how each author attempts to give an inadequate idea of the duration of each formation or even each stratum a man must for years examine for himself great piles of superimposed strata and watch the sea at work grinding down old rocks and making fresh sediment before he can hope to comprehend anything of the lapse of time the monuments of which we see around us it is good to wander along lines of sea coast when formed of moderately hard rocks and mark the 283 process of degradation the tides in most cases reach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day and the waves eat into them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles for there is good evidence that pure water can effect little or nothing in wearing away rock at last the base of the cliff is undermined huge fragments fall down and these remaining fixed have to be worn away atom by atom until reduced in size they can be rolled about by the waves and then are more quickly ground into pebbles sand or mud but how often do we see along the bases of retreating cliffs rounded boulders all thickly clothed by marine productions showing how little they are abraded and how seldom they are rolled about moreover if we follow for a few miles any line of rocky cliff which is undergoing degradation we find that it is only here and there along a short length or round a promontory that the cliffs are at the present time suffering the appearance of the surface and the vegetation show that elsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed their base he who most closely studies the action of the sea on our shores will i believe be most deeply impressed with the slowness with which rocky coasts are worn away the observations on this head by hugh miller and by that excellent observer mr smith of jordan hill are most impressive with the mind thus impressed let any one examine beds of conglomerate many thousand feet in thickness which though probably formed at a quicker rate than many other deposits yet from being formed of worn and rounded pebbles each of which bears the stamp of time are good to show how slowly the mass has been accumulated in the cordillera i estimated one pile of conglomerate at ten thousand feet in thickness let the 284 observer remember lyell s profound remark that the thickness and extent of sedimentary formations are the result and measure of the degradation which the earth s crust has elsewhere suffered and what an amount of degradation is implied by the sedimentary deposits of many countries professor ramsay has given me the maximum thickness in most cases from actual measurement in a few cases from estimate of each formation in different parts of great britain and this is the result feet palг ozoic strata not including igneous beds 57 154 secondary strata 13 190 tertiary strata 2 240 making altogether 72 584 feet that is very nearly thirteen and three quarters british miles some of the formations which are represented in england by thin beds are thousands of feet in thickness on the continent moreover between each successive formation we have in the opinion of most geologists enormously long blank periods so that the lofty pile of sedimentary rocks in britain gives but an inadequate idea of the time which has elapsed during their accumulation yet what time this must have consumed good observers have estimated that sediment is deposited by the great mississippi river at the rate of only 600 feet in a hundred thousand years this estimate has no pretension to strict exactness yet considering over what wide spaces very fine sediment is transported by the currents of the sea the process of accumulation in any one area must be extremely slow but the amount of denudation which the strata have in many places suffered independently of the rate of accumulation of the degraded matter probably offers the best evidence of the lapse of time i remember 285 having been much struck with the evidence of denudation when viewing volcanic islands which have been worn by the waves and pared all round into perpendicular cliffs of one or two thousand feet in height for the gentle slope of the lava streams due to their formerly liquid state showed at a glance how far the hard rocky beds had once extended into the open ocean the same story is still more plainly told by faults those great cracks along which the strata have been upheaved on one side or thrown down on the other to the height or depth of thousands of feet for since the crust cracked the surface of the land has been so completely planed down by the action of the sea that no trace of these vast dislocations is externally visible the craven fault for instance extends for upwards of 30 miles and along this line the vertical displacement of the strata has varied from 600 to 3000 feet prof ramsay has published an account of a downthrow in anglesea of 2300 feet and he informs me that he fully believes there is one in merionethshire of 12 000 feet yet in these cases there is nothing on the surface to show such prodigious movements the pile of rocks on the one or other side having been smoothly swept away the consideration of these facts impresses my mind almost in the same manner as does the vain endeavour to grapple with the idea of eternity i am tempted to give one other case the well known one of the denudation of the weald though it must be admitted that the denudation of the weald has been a mere trifle in comparison with that which has removed masses of our palг ozoic strata in parts ten thousand feet in thickness as shown in prof ramsay s masterly memoir on this subject yet it is an admirable lesson to stand on the intermediate hilly country and look on the one hand at the north downs and 286 on the other hand at the south downs for remembering that at no great distance to the west the northern and southern escarpments meet and close one can safely picture to oneself the great dome of rocks which must have covered up the weald within so limited a period as since the latter part of the chalk formation the distance from the northern to the southern downs is about 22 miles and the thickness of the several formations is on an average about 1100 feet as i am informed by prof ramsay but if as some geologists suppose a range of older rocks underlies the weald on the flanks of which the overlying sedimentary deposits might have accumulated in thinner masses than elsewhere the above estimate would be erroneous but this source of doubt probably would not greatly affect the estimate as applied to the western extremity of the district if then we knew the rate at which the sea commonly wears away a line of cliff of any given height we could measure the time requisite to have denuded the weald this of course cannot be done but we may in order to form some crude notion on the subject assume that the sea would eat into cliffs 500 feet in height at the rate of one inch in a century this will at first appear much too small an allowance but it is the same as if we were to assume a cliff one yard in height to be eaten back along a whole line of coast at the rate of one yard in nearly every twenty two years i doubt whether any rock even as soft as chalk would yield at this rate excepting on the most exposed coasts though no doubt the degradation of a lofty cliff would be more rapid from the breakage of the fallen fragments on the other hand i do not believe that any line of coast ten or twenty miles in length ever suffers degradation at the same time along its whole indented length and we 287 must remember that almost all strata contain harder layers or nodules which from long resisting attrition form a breakwater at the base we may at least confidently believe that no rocky coast 500 feet in height commonly yields at the rate of a foot per century for this would be the same in amount as a cliff one yard in height retreating twelve yards in twenty two years and no one i think who has carefully observed the shape of old fallen fragments at the base of cliffs will admit any near approach to such rapid wearing away hence under ordinary circumstances i should infer that for a cliff 500 feet in height a denudation of one inch per century for the whole length would be a sufficient allowance at this rate on the above data the denudation of the weald must have required 306 662 400 years or say three hundred million years but perhaps it would be safer to allow two or three inches per century and this would reduce the number of years to one hundred and fifty or one hundred million years the action of fresh water on the gently inclined wealden district when upraised could hardly have been great but it would somewhat reduce the above estimate on the other hand during oscillations of level which we know this area has undergone the surface may have existed for millions of years as land and thus have escaped the action of the sea when deeply submerged for perhaps equally long periods it would likewise have escaped the action of the coast waves so that it is not improbable that a longer period than 300 million years has elapsed since the latter part of the secondary period i have made these few remarks because it is highly important for us to gain some notion however imperfect of the lapse of years during each of these years 288 over the whole world the land and the water has been peopled by hosts of living forms what an infinite number of generations which the mind cannot grasp must have succeeded each other in the long roll of years now turn to our richest geological museums and what a paltry display we behold on the poorness of our palг ontological collections that our palг ontological collections are very imperfect is admitted by every one the remark of that admirable palг ontologist the late edward forbes should not be forgotten namely that numbers of our fossil species are known and named from single and often broken specimens or from a few specimens collected on some one spot only a small portion of the surface of the earth has been geologically explored and no part with sufficient care as the important discoveries made every year in europe prove no organism wholly soft can be preserved shells and bones will decay and disappear when left on the bottom of the sea where sediment is not accumulating i believe we are continually taking a most erroneous view when we tacitly admit to ourselves that sediment is being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea at a rate sufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains throughout an enormously large proportion of the ocean the bright blue tint of the water bespeaks its purity the many cases on record of a formation conformably covered after an enormous interval of time by another and later formation without the underlying bed having suffered in the interval any wear and tear seem explicable only on the view of the bottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition the remains which do become embedded if in sand or gravel will when the beds are upraised generally be dissolved 289 by the percolation of rain water i suspect that but few of the very many animals which live on the beach between high and low watermark are preserved for instance the several species of the chthamalinг a subfamily of sessile cirripedes coat the rocks all over the world in infinite numbers they are all strictly littoral with the exception of a single mediterranean species which inhabits deep water and has been found fossil in sicily whereas not one other species has hitherto been found in any tertiary formation yet it is now known that the genus chthamalus existed during the chalk period the molluscan genus chiton offers a partially analogous case with respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during the secondary and palг ozoic periods it is superfluous to state that our evidence from fossil remains is fragmentary in an extreme degree for instance not a land shell is known belonging to either of these vast periods with the exception of one species discovered by sir c lyell and dr dawson in the carboniferous strata of north america of which shell several specimens have now been collected in regard to mammiferous remains a single glance at the historical table published in the supplement to lyell s manual will bring home the truth how accidental and rare is their preservation far better than pages of detail nor is their rarity surprising when we remember how large a proportion of the bones of tertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrine deposits and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belonging to the age of our secondary or palг ozoic formations but the imperfection in the geological record mainly results from another and more important cause than any of the foregoing namely from the several formations 290 being separated from each other by wide intervals of time when we see the formations tabulated in written works or when we follow them in nature it is difficult to avoid believing that they are closely consecutive but we know for instance from sir r murchison s great work on russia what wide gaps there are in that country between the superimposed formations so it is in north america and in many other parts of the world the most skilful geologist if his attention had been exclusively confined to these large territories would never have suspected that during the periods which were blank and barren in his own country great piles of sediment charged with new and peculiar forms of life had elsewhere been accumulated and if in each separate territory hardly any idea can be formed of the length of time which has elapsed between the consecutive formations we may infer that this could nowhere be ascertained the frequent and great changes in the mineralogical composition of consecutive formations generally implying great changes in the geography of the surrounding lands whence the sediment has been derived accords with the belief of vast intervals of time having elapsed between each formation but we can i think see why the geological formations of each region are almost invariably intermittent that is have not followed each other in close sequence scarcely any fact struck me more when examining many hundred miles of the south american coasts which have been upraised several hundred feet within the recent period than the absence of any recent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a short geological period along the whole west coast which is inhabited by a peculiar marine fauna tertiary beds are so poorly developed that no record of several 291 successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably be preserved to a distant age a little reflection will explain why along the rising coast of the western side of south america no extensive formations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be found though the supply of sediment must for ages have been great from the enormous degradation of the coast rocks and from muddy streams entering the sea the explanation no doubt is that the littoral and sub littoral deposits are continually worn away as soon as they are brought up by the slow and gradual rising of the land within the grinding action of the coast waves we may i think safely conclude that sediment must be accumulated in extremely thick solid or extensive masses in order to withstand the incessant action of the waves when first upraised and during subsequent oscillations of level such thick and extensive accumulations of sediment may be formed in two ways either in profound depths of the sea in which case judging from the researches of e forbes we may conclude that the bottom will be inhabited by extremely few animals and the mass when upraised will give a most imperfect record of the forms of life which then existed or sediment may be accumulated to any thickness and extent over a shallow bottom if it continue slowly to subside in this latter case as long as the rate of subsidence and supply of sediment nearly balance each other the sea will remain shallow and favourable for life and thus a fossiliferous formation thick enough when upraised to resist any amount of degradation may be formed i am convinced that all our ancient formations which are rich in fossils have thus been formed during subsidence since publishing my views on this subject in 1845 i have watched the progress of 292 geology and have been surprised to note how author after author in treating of this or that great formation has come to the conclusion that it was accumulated during subsidence i may add that the only ancient tertiary formation on the west coast of south america which has been bulky enough to resist such degradation as it has as yet suffered but which will hardly last to a distant geological age was certainly deposited during a downward oscillation of level and thus gained considerable thickness all geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergone numerous slow oscillations of level and apparently these oscillations have affected wide spaces consequently formations rich in fossils and sufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation may have been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence but only where the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow and to embed and preserve the remains before they had time to decay on the other hand as long as the bed of the sea remained stationary thick deposits could not have been accumulated in the shallow parts which are the most favourable to life still less could this have happened during the alternate periods of elevation or to speak more accurately the beds which were then accumulated will have been destroyed by being upraised and brought within the limits of the coast action thus the geological record will almost necessarily be rendered intermittent i feel much confidence in the truth of these views for they are in strict accordance with the general principles inculcated by sir c lyell and e forbes subsequently but independently arrived at a similar conclusion one remark is here worth a passing notice during periods of elevation the area of the land and of the 293 adjoining shoal parts of the sea will be increased and new stations will often be formed all circumstances most favourable as previously explained for the formation of new varieties and species but during such periods there will generally be a blank in the geological record on the other hand during subsidence the inhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease excepting the productions on the shores of a continent when first broken up into an archipelago and consequently during subsidence though there will be much extinction fewer new varieties or species will be formed and it is during these very periods of subsidence that our great deposits rich in fossils have been accumulated nature may almost be said to have guarded against the frequent discovery of her transitional or linking forms from the foregoing considerations it cannot be doubted that the geological record viewed as a whole is extremely imperfect but if we confine our attention to any one formation it becomes more difficult to understand why we do not therein find closely graduated varieties between the allied species which lived at its commencement and at its close some cases are on record of the same species presenting distinct varieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation but as they are rare they may be here passed over although each formation has indisputably required a vast number of years for its deposition i can see several reasons why each should not include a graduated series of links between the species which then lived but i can by no means pretend to assign due proportional weight to the following considerations although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years each perhaps is short compared with the period requisite to change one species into another i am 294 aware that two palг ontologists whose opinions are worthy of much deference namely bronn and woodward have concluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or thrice as long as the average duration of specific forms but insuperable difficulties as it seems to me prevent us coming to any just conclusion on this head when we see a species first appearing in the middle of any formation it would be rash in the extreme to infer that it had not elsewhere previously existed so again when we find a species disappearing before the uppermost layers have been deposited it would be equally rash to suppose that it then became wholly extinct we forget how small the area of europe is compared with the rest of the world nor have the several stages of the same formation throughout europe been correlated with perfect accuracy with marine animals of all kinds we may safely infer a large amount of migration during climatal and other changes and when we see a species first appearing in any formation the probability is that it only then first immigrated into that area it is well known for instance that several species appeared somewhat earlier in the palг ozoic beds of north america than in those of europe time having apparently been required for their migration from the american to the european seas in examining the latest deposits of various quarters of the world it has everywhere been noted that some few still existing species are common in the deposit but have become extinct in the immediately surrounding sea or conversely that some are now abundant in the neighbouring sea but are rare or absent in this particular deposit it is an excellent lesson to reflect on the ascertained amount of migration of the inhabitants of europe during the glacial period which forms only a part of one whole geological period 295 and likewise to reflect on the great changes of level on the inordinately great change of climate on the prodigious lapse of time all included within this same glacial period yet it may be doubted whether in any quarter of the world sedimentary deposits including fossil remains have gone on accumulating within the same area during the whole of this period it is not for instance probable that sediment was deposited during the whole of the glacial period near the mouth of the mississippi within that limit of depth at which marine animals can flourish for we know what vast geographical changes occurred in other parts of america during this space of time when such beds as were deposited in shallow water near the mouth of the mississippi during some part of the glacial period shall have been upraised organic remains will probably first appear and disappear at different levels owing to the migration of species and to geographical changes and in the distant future a geologist examining these beds might be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life of the embedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period instead of having been really far greater that is extending from before the glacial epoch to the present day in order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper and lower parts of the same formation the deposit must have gone on accumulating for a very long period in order to have given sufficient time for the slow process of variation hence the deposit will generally have to be a very thick one and the species undergoing modification will have had to live on the same area throughout this whole time but we have seen that a thick fossiliferous formation can only be accumulated during a period of subsidence and to keep the depth approximately the same which is necessary in 296 order to enable the same species to live on the same space the supply of sediment must nearly have counterbalanced the amount of subsidence but this same movement of subsidence will often tend to sink the area whence the sediment is derived and thus diminish the supply whilst the downward movement continues in fact this nearly exact balancing between the supply of sediment and the amount of subsidence is probably a rare contingency for it has been observed by more than one palг ontologist that very thick deposits are usually barren of organic remains except near their upper or lower limits it would seem that each separate formation like the whole pile of formations in any country has generally been intermittent in its accumulation when we see as is so often the case a formation composed of beds of different mineralogical composition we may reasonably suspect that the process of deposition has been much interrupted as a change in the currents of the sea and a supply of sediment of a different nature will generally have been due to geographical changes requiring much time nor will the closest inspection of a formation give any idea of the time which its deposition has consumed many instances could be given of beds only a few feet in thickness representing formations elsewhere thousands of feet in thickness and which must have required an enormous period for their accumulation yet no one ignorant of this fact would have suspected the vast lapse of time represented by the thinner formation many cases could be given of the lower beds of a formation having been upraised denuded submerged and then re covered by the upper beds of the same formation facts showing what wide yet easily overlooked intervals have occurred in its accumulation in other cases we have the plainest evidence 297 in great fossilised trees still standing upright as they grew of many long intervals of time and changes of level during the process of deposition which would never even have been suspected had not the trees chanced to have been preserved thus messrs lyell and dawson found carboniferous beds 1400 feet thick in nova scotia with ancient root bearing strata one above the other at no less than sixty eight different levels hence when the same species occur at the bottom middle and top of a formation the probability is that they have not lived on the same spot during the whole period of deposition but have disappeared and reappeared perhaps many times during the same geological period so that if such species were to undergo a considerable amount of modification during any one geological period a section would not probably include all the fine intermediate gradations which must on my theory have existed between them but abrupt though perhaps very slight changes of form it is all important to remember that naturalists have no golden rule by which to distinguish species and varieties they grant some little variability to each species but when they meet with a somewhat greater amount of difference between any two forms they rank both as species unless they are enabled to connect them together by close intermediate gradations and this from the reasons just assigned we can seldom hope to effect in any one geological section supposing b and c to be two species and a third a to be found in an underlying bed even if a were strictly intermediate between b and c it would simply be ranked as a third and distinct species unless at the same time it could be most closely connected with either one or both forms by intermediate varieties nor should it be forgotten as before explained that a might be the actual progenitor 298 of b and c and yet might not at all necessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all points of structure so that we might obtain the parent species and its several modified descendants from the lower and upper beds of a formation and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations we should not recognise their relationship and should consequently be compelled to rank them all as distinct species it is notorious on what excessively slight differences many palг ontologists have founded their species and they do this the more readily if the specimens come from different sub stages of the same formation some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of the very fine species of d orbigny and others into the rank of varieties and on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on my theory we ought to find moreover if we look to rather wider intervals namely to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great formation we find that the embedded fossils though almost universally ranked as specifically different yet are far more closely allied to each other than are the species found in more widely separated formations but to this subject i shall have to return in the following chapter one other consideration is worth notice with animals and plants that can propagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive there is reason to suspect as we have formerly seen that their varieties are generally at first local and that such local varieties do not spread widely and supplant their parent forms until they have been modified and perfected in some considerable degree according to this view the chance of discovering in a formation in any one country all the early stages of transition between any two forms is small for the successive changes are supposed to have been local or 299 confined to some one spot most marine animals have a wide range and we have seen that with plants it is those which have the widest range that oftenest present varieties so that with shells and other marine animals it is probably those which have had the widest range far exceeding the limits of the known geological formations of europe which have oftenest given rise first to local varieties and ultimately to new species and this again would greatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages of transition in any one geological formation it should not be forgotten that at the present day with perfect specimens for examination two forms can seldom be connected by intermediate varieties and thus proved to be the same species until many specimens have been collected from many places and in the case of fossil species this could rarely be effected by palг ontologists we shall perhaps best perceive the improbability of our being enabled to connect species by numerous fine intermediate fossil links by asking ourselves whether for instance geologists at some future period will be able to prove that our different breeds of cattle sheep horses and dogs have descended from a single stock or from several aboriginal stocks or again whether certain sea shells inhabiting the shores of north america which are ranked by some conchologists as distinct species from their european representatives and by other conchologists as only varieties are really varieties or are as it is called specifically distinct this could be effected only by the future geologist discovering in a fossil state numerous intermediate gradations and such success seems to me improbable in the highest degree geological research though it has added numerous species to existing and extinct genera and has made the 300 intervals between some few groups less wide than they otherwise would have been yet has done scarcely anything in breaking down the distinction between species by connecting them together by numerous fine intermediate varieties and this not having been effected is probably the gravest and most obvious of all the many objections which may be urged against my views hence it will be worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks under an imaginary illustration the malay archipelago is of about the size of europe from the north cape to the mediterranean and from britain to russia and therefore equals all the geological formations which have been examined with any accuracy excepting those of the united states of america i fully agree with mr godwin austen that the present condition of the malay archipelago with its numerous large islands separated by wide and shallow seas probably represents the former state of europe whilst most of our formations were accumulating the malay archipelago is one of the richest regions of the whole world in organic beings yet if all the species were to be collected which have ever lived there how imperfectly would they represent the natural history of the world but we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions of the archipelago would be preserved in an excessively imperfect manner in the formations which we suppose to be there accumulating i suspect that not many of the strictly littoral animals or of those which lived on naked submarine rocks would be embedded and those embedded in gravel or sand would not endure to a distant epoch wherever sediment did not accumulate on the bed of the sea or where it did not accumulate at a sufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay no remains could be preserved i believe that fossiliferous formations could be formed 301 in the archipelago of thickness sufficient to last to an age as distant in futurity as the secondary formations lie in the past only during periods of subsidence these periods of subsidence would be separated from each other by enormous intervals during which the area would be either stationary or rising whilst rising each fossiliferous formation would be destroyed almost as soon as accumulated by the incessant coast action as we now see on the shores of south america during the periods of subsidence there would probably be much extinction of life during the periods of elevation there would be much variation but the geological record would then be least perfect it may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period of subsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago together with a contemporaneous accumulation of sediment would exceed the average duration of the same specific forms and these contingencies are indispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradations between any two or more species if such gradations were not fully preserved transitional varieties would merely appear as so many distinct species it is also probable that each great period of subsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level and that slight climatal changes would intervene during such lengthy periods and in these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would have to migrate and no closely consecutive record of their modifications could be preserved in any one formation very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now range thousands of miles beyond its confines and analogy leads me to believe that it would be chiefly these far ranging species which would oftenest produce new varieties and the varieties would at first generally be local or confined to one place but if possessed 302 of any decided advantage or when further modified and improved they would slowly spread and supplant their parent forms when such varieties returned to their ancient homes as they would differ from their former state in a nearly uniform though perhaps extremely slight degree they would according to the principles followed by many palг ontologists be ranked as new and distinct species if then there be some degree of truth in these remarks we have no right to expect to find in our geological formations an infinite number of those fine transitional forms which on my theory assuredly have connected all the past and present species of the same group into one long and branching chain of life we ought only to look for a few links some more closely some more distantly related to each other and these links let them be ever so close if found in different stages of the same formation would by most palг ontologists be ranked as distinct species but i do not pretend that i should ever have suspected how poor a record of the mutations of life the best preserved geological section presented had not the difficulty of our not discovering innumerable transitional links between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of each formation pressed so hardly on my theory on the sudden appearance of whole groups of allied species the abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear in certain formations has been urged by several palг ontologists for instance by agassiz pictet and by none more forcibly than by professor sedgwick as a fatal objection to the belief in the transmutation of species if numerous species belonging to the same genera or families have really 303 started into life all at once the fact would be fatal to the theory of descent with slow modification through natural selection for the development of a group of forms all of which have descended from some one progenitor must have been an extremely slow process and the progenitors must have lived long ages before their modified descendants but we continually over rate the perfection of the geological record and falsely infer because certain genera or families have not been found beneath a certain stage that they did not exist before that stage we continually forget how large the world is compared with the area over which our geological formations have been carefully examined we forget that groups of species may elsewhere have long existed and have slowly multiplied before they invaded the ancient archipelagoes of europe and of the united states we do not make due allowance for the enormous intervals of time which have probably elapsed between our consecutive formations longer perhaps in most cases than the time required for the accumulation of each formation these intervals will have given time for the multiplication of species from some one or some few parent forms and in the succeeding formation such species will appear as if suddenly created i may here recall a remark formerly made namely that it might require a long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiar line of life for instance to fly through the air but that when this had been effected and a few species had thus acquired a great advantage over other organisms a comparatively short time would be necessary to produce many divergent forms which would be able to spread rapidly and widely throughout the world i will now give a few examples to illustrate these 304 remarks and to show how liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of species have suddenly been produced i may recall the well known fact that in geological treatises published not many years ago the great class of mammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at the commencement of the tertiary series and now one of the richest known accumulations of fossil mammals for its thickness belongs to the middle of the secondary series and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstone at nearly the commencement of this great series cuvier used to urge that no monkey occurred in any tertiary stratum but now extinct species have been discovered in india south america and in europe even as far back as the eocene stage had it not been for the rare accident of the preservation of footsteps in the new red sandstone of the united states who would have ventured to suppose that besides reptiles no less than at least thirty kinds of birds some of gigantic size existed during that period not a fragment of bone has been discovered in these beds notwithstanding that the number of joints shown in the fossil impressions correspond with the number in the several toes of living birds feet some authors doubt whether the animals which left the impressions were really birds until quite recently these authors might have maintained and some have maintained that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during an early tertiary period but now we know on the authority of professor owen as may be seen in lyell s manual that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand i may give another instance which from having passed under my own eyes has much struck me in a memoir on fossil sessile cirripedes i have stated that from the 305 number of existing and extinct tertiary species from the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many species all over the world from the arctic regions to the equator inhabiting various zones of depths from the upper tidal limits to 50 fathoms from the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved in the oldest tertiary beds from the ease with which even a fragment of a valve can be recognised from all these circumstances i inferred that had sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary periods they would certainly have been preserved and discovered and as not one species had then been discovered in beds of this age i concluded that this great group had been suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary series this was a sore trouble to me adding as i thought one more instance of the abrupt appearance of a great group of species but my work had hardly been published when a skilful palг ontologist m bosquet sent me a drawing of a perfect specimen of an unmistakeable sessile cirripede which he had himself extracted from the chalk of belgium and as if to make the case as striking as possible this sessile cirripede was a chthamalus a very common large and ubiquitous genus of which not one specimen has as yet been found even in any tertiary stratum hence we now positively know that sessile cirripedes existed during the secondary period and these cirripedes might have been the progenitors of our many tertiary and existing species the case most frequently insisted on by palг ontologists of the apparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species is that of the teleostean fishes low down in the chalk period this group includes the large majority of existing species lately professor pictet has carried their existence one sub stage further back and some palг ontologists believe that certain 306 much older fishes of which the affinities are as yet imperfectly known are really teleostean assuming however that the whole of them did appear as agassiz believes at the commencement of the chalk formation the fact would certainly be highly remarkable but i cannot see that it would be an insuperable difficulty on my theory unless it could likewise be shown that the species of this group appeared suddenly and simultaneously throughout the world at this same period it is almost superfluous to remark that hardly any fossil fish are known from south of the equator and by running through pictet s palг ontology it will be seen that very few species are known from several formations in europe some few families of fish now have a confined range the teleostean fish might formerly have had a similarly confined range and after having been largely developed in some one sea might have spread widely nor have we any right to suppose that the seas of the world have always been so freely open from south to north as they are at present even at this day if the malay archipelago were converted into land the tropical parts of the indian ocean would form a large and perfectly enclosed basin in which any great group of marine animals might be multiplied and here they would remain confined until some of the species became adapted to a cooler climate and were enabled to double the southern capes of africa or australia and thus reach other and distant seas from these and similar considerations but chiefly from our ignorance of the geology of other countries beyond the confines of europe and the united states and from the revolution in our palг ontological ideas on many points which the discoveries of even the last dozen years have effected it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on the succession of organic 307 beings throughout the world as it would be for a naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point in australia and then to discuss the number and range of its productions on the sudden appearance of groups of allied species in the lowest known fossiliferous strata there is another and allied difficulty which is much graver i allude to the manner in which numbers of species of the same group suddenly appear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks most of the arguments which have convinced me that all the existing species of the same group have descended from one progenitor apply with nearly equal force to the earliest known species for instance i cannot doubt that all the silurian trilobites have descended from some one crustacean which must have lived long before the silurian age and which probably differed greatly from any known animal some of the most ancient silurian animals as the nautilus lingula c do not differ much from living species and it cannot on my theory be supposed that these old species were the progenitors of all the species of the orders to which they belong for they do not present characters in any degree intermediate between them if moreover they had been the progenitors of these orders they would almost certainly have been long ago supplanted and exterminated by their numerous and improved descendants consequently if my theory be true it is indisputable that before the lowest silurian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed as long as or probably far longer than the whole interval from the silurian age to the present day and that during these vast yet quite unknown periods of time the world swarmed with living creatures 308 to the question why we do not find records of these vast primordial periods i can give no satisfactory answer several of the most eminent geologists with sir e murchison at their head are convinced that we see in the organic remains of the lowest silurian stratum the dawn of life on this planet other highly competent judges as lyell and the late e forbes dispute this conclusion we should not forget that only a small portion of the world is known with accuracy m barrande has lately added another and lower stage to the silurian system abounding with new and peculiar species traces of life have been detected in the longmynd beds beneath barrande s so called primordial zone the presence of phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter in some of the lowest azoic rocks probably indicates the former existence of life at these periods but the difficulty of understanding the absence of vast piles of fossiliferous strata which on my theory no doubt were somewhere accumulated before the silurian epoch is very great if these most ancient beds had been wholly worn away by denudation or obliterated by metamorphic action we ought to find only small remnants of the formations next succeeding them in age and these ought to be very generally in a metamorphosed condition but the descriptions which we now possess of the silurian deposits over immense territories in russia and in north america do not support the view that the older a formation is the more it has always suffered the extremity of denudation and metamorphism the case at present must remain inexplicable and may be truly urged as a valid argument against the views here entertained to show that it may hereafter receive some explanation i will give the following hypothesis from the nature of the organic remains which 309 do not appear to have inhabited profound depths in the several formations of europe and of the united states and from the amount of sediment miles in thickness of which the formations are composed we may infer that from first to last large islands or tracts of land whence the sediment was derived occurred in the neighbourhood of the existing continents of europe and north america but we do not know what was the state of things in the intervals between the successive formations whether europe and the united states during these intervals existed as dry land or as a submarine surface near land on which sediment was not deposited or as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea looking to the existing oceans which are thrice as extensive as the land we see them studded with many islands but not one oceanic island is as yet known to afford even a remnant of any palг ozoic or secondary formation hence we may perhaps infer that during the palг ozoic and secondary periods neither continents nor continental islands existed where our oceans now extend for had they existed there palг ozoic and secondary formations would in all probability have been accumulated from sediment derived from their wear and tear and would have been at least partially upheaved by the oscillations of level which we may fairly conclude must have intervened during these enormously long periods if then we may infer anything from these facts we may infer that where our oceans now extend oceans have extended from the remotest period of which we have any record and on the other hand that where continents now exist large tracts of land have existed subjected no doubt to great oscillations of level since the earliest silurian period the coloured map appended to my volume on coral reefs led me to conclude that the great oceans are still mainly areas of 310 subsidence the great archipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level and the continents areas of elevation but have we any right to assume that things have thus remained from the beginning of this world our continents seem to have been formed by a preponderance during many oscillations of level of the force of elevation but may not the areas of preponderant movement have changed in the lapse of ages at a period immeasurably antecedent to the silurian epoch continents may have existed where oceans are now spread out and clear and open oceans may have existed where our continents now stand nor should we be justified in assuming that if for instance the bed of the pacific ocean were now converted into a continent we should there find formations older than the silurian strata supposing such to have been formerly deposited for it might well happen that strata which had subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth and which had been pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water might have undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have always remained nearer to the surface the immense areas in some parts of the world for instance in south america of bare metamorphic rocks which must have been heated under great pressure have always seemed to me to require some special explanation and we may perhaps believe that we see in these large areas the many formations long anterior to the silurian epoch in a completely metamorphosed condition the several difficulties here discussed namely our not finding in the successive formations infinitely numerous transitional links between the many species which now exist or have existed the sudden manner 311 in which whole groups of species appear in our european formations the almost entire absence as at present known of fossiliferous formations beneath the silurian strata are all undoubtedly of the gravest nature we see this in the plainest manner by the fact that all the most eminent palг ontologists namely cuvier agassiz barrande falconer e forbes c and all our greatest geologists as lyell murchison sedgwick c have unanimously often vehemently maintained the immutability of species but i have reason to believe that one great authority sir charles lyell from further reflexion entertains grave doubts on this subject i feel how rash it is to differ from these authorities to whom with others we owe all our knowledge those who think the natural geological record in any degree perfect and who do not attach much weight to the facts and arguments of other kinds given in this volume will undoubtedly at once reject my theory for my part following out lyell s metaphor i look at the natural geological record as a history of the world imperfectly kept and written in a changing dialect of this history we possess the last volume alone relating only to two or three countries of this volume only here and there a short chapter has been preserved and of each page only here and there a few lines each word of the slowly changing language in which the history is supposed to be written being more or less different in the interrupted succession of chapters may represent the apparently abruptly changed forms of life entombed in our consecutive but widely separated formations on this view the difficulties above discussed are greatly diminished or even disappear 312 chapter x on the geological succession of organic beings on the slow and successive appearance of new species on their different rates of change species once lost do not reappear groups of species follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species on extinction on simultaneous changes in the forms of life throughout the world on the affinities of extinct species to each other and to living species on the state of development of ancient forms on the succession of the same types within the same areas summary of preceding and present chapters let us now see whether the several facts and rules relating to the geological succession of organic beings better accord with the common view of the immutability of species or with that of their slow and gradual modification through descent and natural selection new species have appeared very slowly one after another both on the land and in the waters lyell has shown that it is hardly possible to resist the evidence on this head in the case of the several tertiary stages and every year tends to fill up the blanks between them and to make the percentage system of lost and new forms more gradual in some of the most recent beds though undoubtedly of high antiquity if measured by years only one or two species are lost forms and only one or two are new forms having here appeared for the first time either locally or as far as we know on the face of the earth if we may trust the observations of philippi in sicily the successive changes in the marine inhabitants of that island have been many and most gradual the secondary formations are more broken but as bronn has remarked neither the appearance 313 nor disappearance of their many now extinct species has been simultaneous in each separate formation species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate or in the same degree in the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact in an existing crocodile associated with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles in the sub himalayan deposits the silurian lingula differs but little from the living species of this genus whereas most of the other silurian molluscs and all the crustaceans have changed greatly the productions of the land seem to change at a quicker rate than those of the sea of which a striking instance has lately been observed in switzerland there is some reason to believe that organisms considered high in the scale of nature change more quickly than those that are low though there are exceptions to this rule the amount of organic change as pictet has remarked does not strictly correspond with the succession of our geological formations so that between each two consecutive formations the forms of life have seldom changed in exactly the same degree yet if we compare any but the most closely related formations all the species will be found to have undergone some change when a species has once disappeared from the face of the earth we have reason to believe that the same identical form never reappears the strongest apparent exception to this latter rule is that of the so called colonies of m barrande which intrude for a period in the midst of an older formation and then allow the pre existing fauna to reappear but lyell s explanation namely that it is a case of temporary migration from a distinct geographical province seems to me satisfactory 314 these several facts accord well with my theory i believe in no fixed law of development causing all the inhabitants of a country to change abruptly or simultaneously or to an equal degree the process of modification must be extremely slow the variability of each species is quite independent of that of all others whether such variability be taken advantage of by natural selection and whether the variations be accumulated to a greater or lesser amount thus causing a greater or lesser amount of modification in the varying species depends on many complex contingencies on the variability being of a beneficial nature on the power of intercrossing on the rate of breeding on the slowly changing physical conditions of the country and more especially on the nature of the other inhabitants with which the varying species comes into competition hence it is by no means surprising that one species should retain the same identical form much longer than others or if changing that it should change less we see the same fact in geographical distribution for instance in the land shells and coleopterous insects of madeira having come to differ considerably from their nearest allies on the continent of europe whereas the marine shells and birds have remained unaltered we can perhaps understand the apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in more highly organised productions compared with marine and lower productions by the more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic and inorganic conditions of life as explained in a former chapter when many of the inhabitants of a country have become modified and improved we can understand on the principle of competition and on that of the many all important relations of organism to organism that any form which does not become in some degree modified and improved 315 will be liable to be exterminated hence we can see why all the species in the same region do at last if we look to wide enough intervals of time become modified for those which do not change will become extinct in members of the same class the average amount of change during long and equal periods of time may perhaps be nearly the same but as the accumulation of long enduring fossiliferous formations depends on great masses of sediment having been deposited on areas whilst subsiding our formations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide and irregularly intermittent intervals consequently the amount of organic change exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive formations is not equal each formation on this view does not mark a new and complete act of creation but only an occasional scene taken almost at hazard in a slowly changing drama we can clearly understand why a species when once lost should never reappear even if the very same conditions of life organic and inorganic should recur for though the offspring of one species might be adapted and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances to fill the exact place of another species in the economy of nature and thus supplant it yet the two forms the old and the new would not be identically the same for both would almost certainly inherit different characters from their distinct progenitors for instance it is just possible if our fantail pigeons were all destroyed that fanciers by striving during long ages for the same object might make a new breed hardly distinguishable from our present fantail but if the parent rock pigeon were also destroyed and in nature we have every reason to believe that the parent form will generally be supplanted and exterminated by its improved offspring it is quite 316 incredible that a fantail identical with the existing breed could be raised from any other species of pigeon or even from the other well established races of the domestic pigeon for the newly formed fantail would be almost sure to inherit from its new progenitor some slight characteristic differences groups of species that is genera and families follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species changing more or less quickly and in a greater or lesser degree a group does not reappear after it has once disappeared or its existence as long as it lasts is continuous i am aware that there are some apparent exceptions to this rule but the exceptions are surprisingly few so few that e forbes pictet and woodward though all strongly opposed to such views as i maintain admit its truth and the rule strictly accords with my theory for as all the species of the same group have descended from some one species it is clear that as long as any species of the group have appeared in the long succession of ages so long must its members have continuously existed in order to have generated either new and modified or the same old and unmodified forms species of the genus lingula for instance must have continuously existed by an unbroken succession of generations from the lowest silurian stratum to the present day we have seen in the last chapter that the species of a group sometimes falsely appear to have come in abruptly and i have attempted to give an explanation of this fact which if true would have been fatal to my views but such cases are certainly exceptional the general rule being a gradual increase in number till the group reaches its maximum and then sooner or later it gradually decreases if the number of the species of a genus or the number of 317 the genera of a family be represented by a vertical line of varying thickness crossing the successive geological formations in which the species are found the line will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end not in a sharp point but abruptly it then gradually thickens upwards sometimes keeping for a space of equal thickness and ultimately thins out in the upper beds marking the decrease and final extinction of the species this gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictly conformable with my theory as the species of the same genus and the genera of the same family can increase only slowly and progressively for the process of modification and the production of a number of allied forms must be slow and gradual one species giving rise first to two or three varieties these being slowly converted into species which in their turn produce by equally slow steps other species and so on like the branching of a great tree from a single stem till the group becomes large on extinction we have as yet spoken only incidentally of the disappearance of species and of groups of species on the theory of natural selection the extinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms are intimately connected together the old notion of all the inhabitants of the earth having been swept away at successive periods by catastrophes is very generally given up even by those geologists as elie de beaumont murchison barrande c whose general views would naturally lead them to this conclusion on the contrary we have every reason to believe from the study of the tertiary formations that species and groups of species gradually disappear one after another first from one spot then from another and finally from the world both single species and whole 318 groups of species last for very unequal periods some groups as we have seen having endured from the earliest known dawn of life to the present day some having disappeared before the close of the palг ozoic period no fixed law seems to determine the length of time during which any single species or any single genus endures there is reason to believe that the complete extinction of the species of a group is generally a slower process than their production if the appearance and disappearance of a group of species be represented as before by a vertical line of varying thickness the line is found to taper more gradually at its upper end which marks the progress of extermination than at its lower end which marks the first appearance and increase in numbers of the species in some cases however the extermination of whole groups of beings as of ammonites towards the close of the secondary period has been wonderfully sudden the whole subject of the extinction of species has been involved in the most gratuitous mystery some authors have even supposed that as the individual has a definite length of life so have species a definite duration no one i think can have marvelled more at the extinction of species than i have done when i found in la plata the tooth of a horse embedded with the remains of mastodon megatherium toxodon and other extinct monsters which all co existed with still living shells at a very late geological period i was filled with astonishment for seeing that the horse since its introduction by the spaniards into south america has run wild over the whole country and has increased in numbers at an unparalleled rate i asked myself what could so recently have exterminated the former horse under conditions of life apparently so favourable but how utterly groundless was my astonishment 319 professor owen soon perceived that the tooth though so like that of the existing horse belonged to an extinct species had this horse been still living but in some degree rare no naturalist would have felt the least surprise at its rarity for rarity is the attribute of a vast number of species of all classes in all countries if we ask ourselves why this or that species is rare we answer that something is unfavourable in its conditions of life but what that something is we can hardly ever tell on the supposition of the fossil horse still existing as a rare species we might have felt certain from the analogy of all other mammals even of the slow breeding elephant and from the history of the naturalisation of the domestic horse in south america that under more favourable conditions it would in a very few years have stocked the whole continent but we could not have told what the unfavourable conditions were which checked its increase whether some one or several contingencies and at what period of the horse s life and in what degree they severally acted if the conditions had gone on however slowly becoming less and less favourable we assuredly should not have perceived the fact yet the fossil horse would certainly have become rarer and rarer and finally extinct its place being seized on by some more successful competitor it is most difficult always to remember that the increase of every living being is constantly being checked by unperceived injurious agencies and that these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficient to cause rarity and finally extinction we see in many cases in the more recent tertiary formations that rarity precedes extinction and we know that this has been the progress of events with those animals which have been exterminated either locally or wholly through 320 man s agency i may repeat what i published in 1845 namely that to admit that species generally become rare before they become extinct to feel no surprise at the rarity of a species and yet to marvel greatly when it ceases to exist is much the same as to admit that sickness in the individual is the forerunner of death to feel no surprise at sickness but when the sick man dies to wonder and to suspect that he died by some unknown deed of violence the theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each new variety and ultimately each new species is produced and maintained by having some advantage over those with which it comes into competition and the consequent extinction of less favoured forms almost inevitably follows it is the same with our domestic productions when a new and slightly improved variety has been raised it at first supplants the less improved varieties in the same neighbourhood when much improved it is transported far and near like our short horn cattle and takes the place of other breeds in other countries thus the appearance of new forms and the disappearance of old forms both natural and artificial are bound together in certain flourishing groups the number of new specific forms which have been produced within a given time is probably greater than that of the old specific forms which have been exterminated but we know that the number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing at least during the later geological periods so that looking to later times we may believe that the production of new forms has caused the extinction of about the same number of old forms the competition will generally be most severe as formerly explained and illustrated by examples between the forms which are most like each other in all respects 321 hence the improved and modified descendants of a species will generally cause the extermination of the parent species and if many new forms have been developed from any one species the nearest allies of that species i e the species of the same genus will be the most liable to extermination thus as i believe a number of new species descended from one species that is a new genus comes to supplant an old genus belonging to the same family but it must often have happened that a new species belonging to some one group will have seized on the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct group and thus caused its extermination and if many allied forms be developed from the successful intruder many will have to yield their places and it will generally be allied forms which will suffer from some inherited inferiority in common but whether it be species belonging to the same or to a distinct class which yield their places to other species which have been modified and improved a few of the sufferers may often long be preserved from being fitted to some peculiar line of life or from inhabiting some distant and isolated station where they have escaped severe competition for instance a single species of trigonia a great genus of shells in the secondary formations survives in the australian seas and a few members of the great and almost extinct group of ganoid fishes still inhabit our fresh waters therefore the utter extinction of a group is generally as we have seen a slower process than its production with respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole families or orders as of trilobites at the close of the palг ozoic period and of ammonites at the close of the secondary period we must remember what has been already said on the probable wide intervals of time 322 between our consecutive formations and in these intervals there may have been much slow extermination moreover when by sudden immigration or by unusually rapid development many species of a new group have taken possession of a new area they will have exterminated in a correspondingly rapid manner many of the old inhabitants and the forms which thus yield their places will commonly be allied for they will partake of some inferiority in common thus as it seems to me the manner in which single species and whole groups of species become extinct accords well with the theory of natural selection we need not marvel at extinction if we must marvel let it be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand the many complex contingencies on which the existence of each species depends if we forget for an instant that each species tends to increase inordinately and that some check is always in action yet seldom perceived by us the whole economy of nature will be utterly obscured whenever we can precisely say why this species is more abundant in individuals than that why this species and not another can be naturalised in a given country then and not till then we may justly feel surprise why we cannot account for the extinction of this particular species or group of species on the forms of life changing almost simultaneously throughout the world scarcely any palг ontological discovery is more striking than the fact that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout the world thus our european chalk formation can be recognised in many distant parts of the world under the most different climates where not a fragment of the mineral chalk itself can be found namely in north 323 america in equatorial south america in tierra del fuego at the cape of good hope and in the peninsula of india for at these distant points the organic remains in certain beds present an unmistakeable degree of resemblance to those of the chalk it is not that the same species are met with for in some cases not one species is identically the same but they belong to the same families genera and sections of genera and sometimes are similarly characterised in such trifling points as mere superficial sculpture moreover other forms which are not found in the chalk of europe but which occur in the formations either above or below are similarly absent at these distant points of the world in the several successive palг ozoic formations of russia western europe and north america a similar parallelism in the forms of life has been observed by several authors so it is according to lyell with the several european and north american tertiary deposits even if the few fossil species which are common to the old and new worlds be kept wholly out of view the general parallelism in the successive forms of life in the stages of the widely separated palг ozoic and tertiary periods would still be manifest and the several formations could be easily correlated these observations however relate to the marine inhabitants of distant parts of the world we have not sufficient data to judge whether the productions of the land and of fresh water change at distant points in the same parallel manner we may doubt whether they have thus changed if the megatherium mylodon macrauchenia and toxodon had been brought to europe from la plata without any information in regard to their geological position no one would have suspected that they had co existed with still living sea shells but as these anomalous monsters co existed with the 324 mastodon and horse it might at least have been inferred that they had lived during one of the later tertiary stages when the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changed simultaneously throughout the world it must not be supposed that this expression relates to the same thousandth or hundred thousandth year or even that it has a very strict geological sense for if all the marine animals which live at the present day in europe and all those that lived in europe during the pleistocene period an enormously remote period as measured by years including the whole glacial epoch were to be compared with those now living in south america or in australia the most skilful naturalist would hardly be able to say whether the existing or the pleistocene inhabitants of europe resembled most closely those of the southern hemisphere so again several highly competent observers believe that the existing productions of the united states are more closely related to those which lived in europe during certain later tertiary stages than to those which now live here and if this be so it is evident that fossiliferous beds deposited at the present day on the shores of north america would hereafter be liable to be classed with somewhat older european beds nevertheless looking to a remotely future epoch there can i think be little doubt that all the more modern marine formations namely the upper pliocene the pleistocene and strictly modern beds of europe north and south america and australia from containing fossil remains in some degree allied and from not including those forms which are only found in the older underlying deposits would be correctly ranked as simultaneous in a geological sense the fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously in the above large sense at distant parts of the world has greatly struck those admirable observers mm 325 de verneuil and d archiac after referring to the parallelism of the palг ozoic forms of life in various parts of europe they add if struck by this strange sequence we turn our attention to north america and there discover a series of analogous phenomena it will appear certain that all these modifications of species their extinction and the introduction of new ones cannot be owing to mere changes in marine currents or other causes more or less local and temporary but depend on general laws which govern the whole animal kingdom m barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely the same effect it is indeed quite futile to look to changes of currents climate or other physical conditions as the cause of these great mutations in the forms of life throughout the world under the most different climates we must as barrande has remarked look to some special law we shall see this more clearly when we treat of the present distribution of organic beings and find how slight is the relation between the physical conditions of various countries and the nature of their inhabitants this great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life throughout the world is explicable on the theory of natural selection new species are formed by new varieties arising which have some advantage over older forms and those forms which are already dominant or have some advantage over the other forms in their own country would naturally oftenest give rise to new varieties or incipient species for these latter must be victorious in a still higher degree in order to be preserved and to survive we have distinct evidence on this head in the plants which are dominant that is which are commonest in their own homes and are most widely diffused having produced the greatest number of new varieties it is also natural that the 326 dominant varying and far spreading species which already have invaded to a certain extent the territories of other species should be those which would have the best chance of spreading still further and of giving rise in new countries to new varieties and species the process of diffusion may often be very slow being dependent on climatal and geographical changes or on strange accidents but in the long run the dominant forms will generally succeed in spreading the diffusion would it is probable be slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinct continents than with the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea we might therefore expect to find as we apparently do find a less strict degree of parallel succession in the productions of the land than of the sea dominant species spreading from any region might encounter still more dominant species and then their triumphant course or even their existence would cease we know not at all precisely what are all the conditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominant species but we can i think clearly see that a number of individuals from giving a better chance of the appearance of favourable variations and that severe competition with many already existing forms would be highly favourable as would be the power of spreading into new territories a certain amount of isolation recurring at long intervals of time would probably be also favourable as before explained one quarter of the world may have been most favourable for the production of new and dominant species on the land and another for those in the waters of the sea if two great regions had been for a long period favourably circumstanced in an equal degree whenever their inhabitants met the battle would be prolonged and severe and some from one birthplace and some from the other might be victorious but in the course of time the 327 forms dominant in the highest degree wherever produced would tend everywhere to prevail as they prevailed they would cause the extinction of other and inferior forms and as these inferior forms would be allied in groups by inheritance whole groups would tend slowly to disappear though here and there a single member might long be enabled to survive thus as it seems to me the parallel and taken in a large sense simultaneous succession of the same forms of life throughout the world accords well with the principle of new species having been formed by dominant species spreading widely and varying the new species thus produced being themselves dominant owing to inheritance and to having already had some advantage over their parents or over other species these again spreading varying and producing new species the forms which are beaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious forms will generally be allied in groups from inheriting some inferiority in common and therefore as new and improved groups spread throughout the world old groups will disappear from the world and the succession of forms in both ways will everywhere tend to correspond there is one other remark connected with this subject worth making i have given my reasons for believing that all our greater fossiliferous formations were deposited during periods of subsidence and that blank intervals of vast duration occurred during the periods when the bed of the sea was either stationary or rising and likewise when sediment was not thrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains during these long and blank intervals i suppose that the inhabitants of each region underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction and that there was much migration from 328 other parts of the world as we have reason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement it is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been accumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world but we are far from having any right to conclude that this has invariably been the case and that large areas have invariably been affected by the same movements when two formations have been deposited in two regions during nearly but not exactly the same period we should find in both from the causes explained in the foregoing paragraphs the same general succession in the forms of life but the species would not exactly correspond for there will have been a little more time in the one region than in the other for modification extinction and immigration i suspect that cases of this nature occur in europe mr prestwich in his admirable memoirs on the eocene deposits of england and france is able to draw a close general parallelism between the successive stages in the two countries but when he compares certain stages in england with those in france although he finds in both a curious accordance in the numbers of the species belonging to the same genera yet the species themselves differ in a manner very difficult to account for considering the proximity of the two areas unless indeed it be assumed that an isthmus separated two seas inhabited by distinct but contemporaneous faunas lyell has made similar observations on some of the later tertiary formations barrande also shows that there is a striking general parallelism in the successive silurian deposits of bohemia and scandinavia nevertheless he finds a surprising amount of difference in the species if the several formations in these regions have not been deposited during the same exact 329 periods a formation in one region often corresponding with a blank interval in the other and if in both regions the species have gone on slowly changing during the accumulation of the several formations and during the long intervals of time between them in this case the several formations in the two regions could be arranged in the same order in accordance with the general succession of the form of life and the order would falsely appear to be strictly parallel nevertheless the species would not all be the same in the apparently corresponding stages in the two regions on the affinities of extinct species to each other and to living forms let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species they all fall into one grand natural system and this fact is at once explained on the principle of descent the more ancient any form is the more as a general rule it differs from living forms but as buckland long ago remarked all fossils can be classed either in still existing groups or between them that the extinct forms of life help to fill up the wide intervals between existing genera families and orders cannot be disputed for if we confine our attention either to the living or to the extinct alone the series is far less perfect than if we combine both into one general system with respect to the vertebrata whole pages could be filled with striking illustrations from our great palaeontologist owen showing how extinct animals fall in between existing groups cuvier ranked the ruminants and pachyderms as the two most distinct orders of mammals but owen has discovered so many fossil links that he has had to alter the whole classification of these two orders and has placed certain pachyderms in the same sub order with ruminants for example he dissolves by fine gradations the apparently 330 wide difference between the pig and the camel in regard to the invertebrata barrande and a higher authority could not be named asserts that he is every day taught that palaeozoic animals though belonging to the same orders families or genera with those living at the present day were not at this early epoch limited in such distinct groups as they now are some writers have objected to any extinct species or group of species being considered as intermediate between living species or groups if by this term it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate in all its characters between two living forms the objection is probably valid but i apprehend that in a perfectly natural classification many fossil species would have to stand between living species and some extinct genera between living genera even between genera belonging to distinct families the most common case especially with respect to very distinct groups such as fish and reptiles seems to be that supposing them to be distinguished at the present day from each other by a dozen characters the ancient members of the same two groups would be distinguished by a somewhat lesser number of characters so that the two groups though formerly quite distinct at that period made some small approach to each other it is a common belief that the more ancient a form is by so much the more it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widely separated from each other this remark no doubt must be restricted to those groups which have undergone much change in the course of geological ages and it would be difficult to prove the truth of the proposition for every now and then even a living animal as the lepidosiren is discovered having affinities directed towards very distinct groups yet if we compare the older reptiles and 331 batrachians the older fish the older cephalopods and the eocene mammals with the more recent members of the same classes we must admit that there is some truth in the remark let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with the theory of descent with modification as the subject is somewhat complex i must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter we may suppose that the numbered letters represent genera and the dotted lines diverging from them the species in each genus the diagram is much too simple too few genera and too few species being given but this is unimportant for us the horizontal lines may represent successive geological formations and all the forms beneath the uppermost line may be considered as extinct the three existing genera a 14 q 14 p 14 will form a small family b 14 and f 14 a closely allied family or sub family and o 14 e 14 m 14 a third family these three families together with the many extinct genera on the several lines of descent diverging from the parent form a will form an order for all will have inherited something in common from their ancient and common progenitor on the principle of the continued tendency to divergence of character which was formerly illustrated by this diagram the more recent any form is the more it will generally differ from its ancient progenitor hence we can understand the rule that the most ancient fossils differ most from existing forms we must not however assume that divergence of character is a necessary contingency it depends solely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize on many and different places in the economy of nature therefore it is quite possible as we have seen in the case of some silurian forms that a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its slightly altered conditions of 332 life and yet retain throughout a vast period the same general characteristics this is represented in the diagram by the letter f 14 all the many forms extinct and recent descended from a make as before remarked one order and this order from the continued effects of extinction and divergence of character has become divided into several sub families and families some of which are supposed to have perished at different periods and some to have endured to the present day by looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms supposed to be embedded in the successive formations were discovered at several points low down in the series the three existing families on the uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other if for instance the genera a 1 a 5 a 10 f 8 m 3 m 6 m 9 were disinterred these three families would be so closely linked together that they probably would have to be united into one great family in nearly the same manner as has occurred with ruminants and pachyderms yet he who objected to call the extinct genera which thus linked the living genera of three families together intermediate in character would be justified as they are intermediate not directly but only by a long and circuitous course through many widely different forms if many extinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle horizontal lines or geological formations for instance above no vi but none from beneath this line then only the two families on the left hand namely a 14 c and b 14 c would have to be united into one family and the two other families namely a 14 to f 14 now including five genera and o 14 to m 14 would yet remain distinct these two families however would be less distinct from each other than they were before the discovery of the fossils if for instance we suppose the existing genera of the two families to differ from each 333 other by a dozen characters in this case the genera at the early period marked vi would differ by a lesser number of characters for at this early stage of descent they have not diverged in character from the common progenitor of the order nearly so much as they subsequently diverged thus it comes that ancient and extinct genera are often in some slight degree intermediate in character between their modified descendants or between their collateral relations in nature the case will be far more complicated than is represented in the diagram for the groups will have been more numerous they will have endured for extremely unequal lengths of time and will have been modified in various degrees as we possess only the last volume of the geological record and that in a very broken condition we have no right to expect except in very rare cases to fill up wide intervals in the natural system and thus unite distinct families or orders all that we have a right to expect is that those groups which have within known geological periods undergone much modification should in the older formations make some slight approach to each other so that the older members should differ less from each other in some of their characters than do the existing members of the same groups and this by the concurrent evidence of our best palг ontologists seems frequently to be the case thus on the theory of descent with modification the main facts with respect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to each other and to living forms seem to me explained in a satisfactory manner and they are wholly inexplicable on any other view on this same theory it is evident that the fauna of any great period in the earth s history will be intermediate in general character between that which preceded and that which succeeded it thus the species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the 334 diagram are the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage and are the parents of those which became still more modified at the seventh stage hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character between the forms of life above and below we must however allow for the entire extinction of some preceding forms and in any one region for the immigration of new forms from other regions and for a large amount of modification during the long and blank intervals between the successive formations subject to these allowances the fauna of each geological period undoubtedly is intermediate in character between the preceding and succeeding faunas i need give only one instance namely the manner in which the fossils of the devonian system when this system was first discovered were at once recognised by palг ontologists as intermediate in character between those of the overlying carboniferous and underlying silurian system but each fauna is not necessarily exactly intermediate as unequal intervals of time have elapsed between consecutive formations it is no real objection to the truth of the statement that the fauna of each period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between the preceding and succeeding faunas that certain genera offer exceptions to the rule for instance mastodons and elephants when arranged by dr falconer in two series first according to their mutual affinities and then according to their periods of existence do not accord in arrangement the species extreme in character are not the oldest or the most recent nor are those which are intermediate in character intermediate in age but supposing for an instant in this and other such cases that the record of the first appearance and disappearance of the species was perfect we have no reason to believe that forms successively produced necessarily endure for 335 corresponding lengths of time a very ancient form might occasionally last much longer than a form elsewhere subsequently produced especially in the case of terrestrial productions inhabiting separated districts to compare small things with great if the principal living and extinct races of the domestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be in serial affinity this arrangement would not closely accord with the order in time of their production and still less with the order of their disappearance for the parent rock pigeon now lives and many varieties between the rock pigeon and the carrier have become extinct and carriers which are extreme in the important character of length of beak originated earlier than short beaked tumblers which are at the opposite end of the series in this same respect closely connected with the statement that the organic remains from an intermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character is the fact insisted on by all palг ontologists that fossils from two consecutive formations are far more closely related to each other than are the fossils from two remote formations pictet gives as a well known instance the general resemblance of the organic remains from the several stages of the chalk formation though the species are distinct in each stage this fact alone from its generality seems to have shaken professor pictet in his firm belief in the immutability of species he who is acquainted with the distribution of existing species over the globe will not attempt to account for the close resemblance of the distinct species in closely consecutive formations by the physical conditions of the ancient areas having remained nearly the same let it be remembered that the forms of life at least those inhabiting the sea have changed almost simultaneously throughout the world and therefore under the most different climates and conditions consider the 336 prodigious vicissitudes of climate during the pleistocene period which includes the whole glacial period and note how little the specific forms of the inhabitants of the sea have been affected on the theory of descent the full meaning of the fact of fossil remains from closely consecutive formations though ranked as distinct species being closely related is obvious as the accumulation of each formation has often been interrupted and as long blank intervals have intervened between successive formations we ought not to expect to find as i attempted to show in the last chapter in any one or two formations all the intermediate varieties between the species which appeared at the commencement and close of these periods but we ought to find after intervals very long as measured by years but only moderately long as measured geologically closely allied forms or as they have been called by some authors representative species and these we assuredly do find we find in short such evidence of the slow and scarcely sensible mutation of specific forms as we have a just right to expect to find on the state of development of ancient forms there has been much discussion whether recent forms are more highly developed than ancient i will not here enter on this subject for naturalists have not as yet defined to each other s satisfaction what is meant by high and low forms the best definition probably is that the higher forms have their organs more distinctly specialised for different functions and as such division of physiological labour seems to be an advantage to each being natural selection will constantly tend in so far to make the later and more modified forms higher than their early progenitors or than the slightly modified descendants of such progenitors in a more general sense the 337 more recent forms must on my theory be higher than the more ancient for each new species is formed by having had some advantage in the struggle for life over other and preceding forms if under a nearly similar climate the eocene inhabitants of one quarter of the world were put into competition with the existing inhabitants of the same or some other quarter the eocene fauna or flora would certainly be beaten and exterminated as would a secondary fauna by an eocene and a palг ozoic fauna by a secondary fauna i do not doubt that this process of improvement has affected in a marked and sensible manner the organisation of the more recent and victorious forms of life in comparison with the ancient and beaten forms but i can see no way of testing this sort of progress crustaceans for instance not the highest in their own class may have beaten the highest molluscs from the extraordinary manner in which european productions have recently spread over new zealand and have seized on places which must have been previously occupied we may believe if all the animals and plants of great britain were set free in new zealand that in the course of time a multitude of british forms would become thoroughly naturalized there and would exterminate many of the natives on the other hand from what we see now occurring in new zealand and from hardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemisphere having become wild in any part of europe we may doubt if all the productions of new zealand were set free in great britain whether any considerable number would be enabled to seize on places now occupied by our native plants and animals under this point of view the productions of great britain may be said to be higher than those of new zealand yet the most skilful naturalist from an examination of the 338 species of the two countries could not have foreseen this result agassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of recent animals of the same classes or that the geological succession of extinct forms is in some degree parallel to the embryological development of recent forms i must follow pictet and huxley in thinking that the truth of this doctrine is very far from proved yet i fully expect to see it hereafter confirmed at least in regard to subordinate groups which have branched off from each other within comparatively recent times for this doctrine of agassiz accords well with the theory of natural selection in a future chapter i shall attempt to show that the adult differs from its embryo owing to variations supervening at a not early age and being inherited at a corresponding age this process whilst it leaves the embryo almost unaltered continually adds in the course of successive generations more and more difference to the adult thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture preserved by nature of the ancient and less modified condition of each animal this view may be true and yet it may never be capable of full proof seeing for instance that the oldest known mammals reptiles and fish strictly belong to their own proper classes though some of these old forms are in a slight degree less distinct from each other than are the typical members of the same groups at the present day it would be vain to look for animals having the common embryological character of the vertebrata until beds far beneath the lowest silurian strata are discovered a discovery of which the chance is very small on the succession of the same types within the same 339 areas during the later tertiary periods mr clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from the australian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of that continent in south america a similar relationship is manifest even to an uneducated eye in the gigantic pieces of armour like those of the armadillo found in several parts of la plata and professor owen has shown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals buried there in such numbers are related to south american types this relationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection of fossil bones made by mm lund and clausen in the caves of brazil i was so much impressed with these facts that i strongly insisted in 1839 and 1845 on this law of the succession of types on this wonderful relationship in the same continent between the dead and the living professor owen has subsequently extended the same generalisation to the mammals of the old world we see the same law in this author s restorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of new zealand we see it also in the birds of the caves of brazil mr woodward has shown that the same law holds good with sea shells but from the wide distribution of most genera of molluscs it is not well displayed by them other cases could be added as the relation between the extinct and living land shells of madeira and between the extinct and living brackish water shells of the aralo caspian sea now what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same types within the same areas mean he would be a bold man who after comparing the present climate of australia and of parts of south america under the same latitude would attempt to account on the one hand by dissimilar physical conditions for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of these two continents 340 and on the other hand by similarity of conditions for the uniformity of the same types in each during the later tertiary periods nor can it be pretended that it is an immutable law that marsupials should have been chiefly or solely produced in australia or that edentata and other american types should have been solely produced in south america for we know that europe in ancient times was peopled by numerous marsupials and i have shown in the publications above alluded to that in america the law of distribution of terrestrial mammals was formerly different from what it now is north america formerly partook strongly of the present character of the southern half of the continent and the southern half was formerly more closely allied than it is at present to the northern half in a similar manner we know from falconer and cautley s discoveries that northern india was formerly more closely related in its mammals to africa than it is at the present time analogous facts could be given in relation to the distribution of marine animals on the theory of descent with modification the great law of the long enduring but not immutable succession of the same types within the same areas is at once explained for the inhabitants of each quarter of the world will obviously tend to leave in that quarter during the next succeeding period of time closely allied though in some degree modified descendants if the inhabitants of one continent formerly differed greatly from those of another continent so will their modified descendants still differ in nearly the same manner and degree but after very long intervals of time and after great geographical changes permitting much inter migration the feebler will yield to the more dominant forms and there will be nothing immutable in the laws of past and present distribution 341 it may be asked in ridicule whether i suppose that the megatherium and other allied huge monsters have left behind them in south america the sloth armadillo and anteater as their degenerate descendants this cannot for an instant be admitted these huge animals have become wholly extinct and have left no progeny but in the caves of brazil there are many extinct species which are closely allied in size and in other characters to the species still living in south america and some of these fossils may be the actual progenitors of living species it must not be forgotten that on my theory all the species of the same genus have descended from some one species so that if six genera each having eight species be found in one geological formation and in the next succeeding formation there be six other allied or representative genera with the same number of species then we may conclude that only one species of each of the six older genera has left modified descendants constituting the six new genera the other seven species of the old genera have all died out and have left no progeny or which would probably be a far commoner case two or three species of two or three alone of the six older genera will have been the parents of the six new genera the other old species and the other whole old genera having become utterly extinct in failing orders with the genera and species decreasing in numbers as apparently is the case of the edentata of south america still fewer genera and species will have left modified blood descendants summary of the preceding and present chapters i have attempted to show that the geological record is extremely imperfect that only a small portion of the globe has been geologically explored with care that 342 only certain classes of organic beings have been largely preserved in a fossil state that the number both of specimens and of species preserved in our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with the incalculable number of generations which must have passed away even during a single formation that owing to subsidence being necessary for the accumulation of fossiliferous deposits thick enough to resist future degradation enormous intervals of time have elapsed between the successive formations that there has probably been more extinction during the periods of subsidence and more variation during the periods of elevation and during the latter the record will have been least perfectly kept that each single formation has not been continuously deposited that the duration of each formation is perhaps short compared with the average duration of specific forms that migration has played an important part in the first appearance of new forms in any one area and formation that widely ranging species are those which have varied most and have oftenest given rise to new species and that varieties have at first often been local all these causes taken conjointly must have tended to make the geological record extremely imperfect and will to a large extent explain why we do not find interminable varieties connecting together all the extinct and existing forms of life by the finest graduated steps he who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record will rightly reject my whole theory for he may ask in vain where are the numberless transitional links which must formerly have connected the closely allied or representative species found in the several stages of the same great formation he may disbelieve in the enormous intervals of time which have elapsed between our consecutive formations he 343 may overlook how important a part migration must have played when the formations of any one great region alone as that of europe are considered he may urge the apparent but often falsely apparent sudden coming in of whole groups of species he may ask where are the remains of those infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed long before the first bed of the silurian system was deposited i can answer this latter question only hypothetically by saying that as far as we can see where our oceans now extend they have for an enormous period extended and where our oscillating continents now stand they have stood ever since the silurian epoch but that long before that period the world may have presented a wholly different aspect and that the older continents formed of formations older than any known to us may now all be in a metamorphosed condition or may lie buried under the ocean passing from these difficulties all the other great leading facts in palг ontology seem to me simply to follow on the theory of descent with modification through natural selection we can thus understand how it is that new species come in slowly and successively how species of different classes do not necessarily change together or at the same rate or in the same degree yet in the long run that all undergo modification to some extent the extinction of old forms is the almost inevitable consequence of the production of new forms we can understand why when a species has once disappeared it never reappears groups of species increase in numbers slowly and endure for unequal periods of time for the process of modification is necessarily slow and depends on many complex contingencies the dominant species of the larger dominant groups tend to leave many modified 344 descendants and thus new sub groups and groups are formed as these are formed the species of the less vigorous groups from their inferiority inherited from a common progenitor tend to become extinct together and to leave no modified offspring on the face of the earth but the utter extinction of a whole group of species may often be a very slow process from the survival of a few descendants lingering in protected and isolated situations when a group has once wholly disappeared it does not reappear for the link of generation has been broken we can understand how the spreading of the dominant forms of life which are those that oftenest vary will in the long run tend to people the world with allied but modified descendants and these will generally succeed in taking the places of those groups of species which are their inferiors in the struggle for existence hence after long intervals of time the productions of the world will appear to have changed simultaneously we can understand how it is that all the forms of life ancient and recent make together one grand system for all are connected by generation we can understand from the continued tendency to divergence of character why the more ancient a form is the more it generally differs from those now living why ancient and extinct forms often tend to fill up gaps between existing forms sometimes blending two groups previously classed as distinct into one but more commonly only bringing them a little closer together the more ancient a form is the more often apparently it displays characters in some degree intermediate between groups now distinct for the more ancient a form is the more nearly it will be related to and consequently resemble the common progenitor of groups since 345 become widely divergent extinct forms are seldom directly intermediate between existing forms but are intermediate only by a long and circuitous course through many extinct and very different forms we can clearly see why the organic remains of closely consecutive formations are more closely allied to each other than are those of remote formations for the forms are more closely linked together by generation we can clearly see why the remains of an intermediate formation are intermediate in character the inhabitants of each successive period in the world s history have beaten their predecessors in the race for life and are in so far higher in the scale of nature and this may account for that vague yet ill defined sentiment felt by many palг ontologists that organisation on the whole has progressed if it should hereafter be proved that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of more recent animals of the same class the fact will be intelligible the succession of the same types of structure within the same areas during the later geological periods ceases to be mysterious and is simply explained by inheritance if then the geological record be as imperfect as i believe it to be and it may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be much more perfect the main objections to the theory of natural selection are greatly diminished or disappear on the other hand all the chief laws of palг ontology plainly proclaim as it seems to me that species have been produced by ordinary generation old forms having been supplanted by new and improved forms of life produced by the laws of variation still acting round us and preserved by natural selection 346 chapter xi geographical distribution present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical conditions importance of barriers affinity of the productions of the same continent centres of creation means of dispersal by changes of climate and of the level of the land and by occasional means dispersal during the glacial period co extensive with the world in considering the distribution of organic beings over the face of the globe the first great fact which strikes us is that neither the similarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regions can be accounted for by their climatal and other physical conditions of late almost every author who has studied the subject has come to this conclusion the case of america alone would almost suffice to prove its truth for if we exclude the northern parts where the circumpolar land is almost continuous all authors agree that one of the most fundamental divisions in geographical distribution is that between the new and old worlds yet if we travel over the vast american continent from the central parts of the united states to its extreme southern point we meet with the most diversified conditions the most humid districts arid deserts lofty mountains grassy plains forests marshes lakes and great rivers under almost every temperature there is hardly a climate or condition in the old world which cannot be paralleled in the new at least as closely as the same species generally require for it is a most rare case to find a group of organisms confined to any small spot having conditions peculiar in only a slight 347 degree for instance small areas in the old world could be pointed out hotter than any in the new world yet these are not inhabited by a peculiar fauna or flora notwithstanding this parallelism in the conditions of the old and new worlds how widely different are their living productions in the southern hemisphere if we compare large tracts of land in australia south africa and western south america between latitudes 25в and 35в we shall find parts extremely similar in all their conditions yet it would not be possible to point out three faunas and floras more utterly dissimilar or again we may compare the productions of south america south of lat 35в with those north of 25в which consequently inhabit a considerably different climate and they will be found incomparably more closely related to each other than they are to the productions of australia or africa under nearly the same climate analogous facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of the sea a second great fact which strikes us in our general review is that barriers of any kind or obstacles to free migration are related in a close and important manner to the differences between the productions of various regions we see this in the great difference of nearly all the terrestrial productions of the new and old worlds excepting in the northern parts where the land almost joins and where under a slightly different climate there might have been free migration for the northern temperate forms as there now is for the strictly arctic productions we see the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants of australia africa and south america under the same latitude for these countries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible on each continent also we see the same fact for on the opposite sides of 348 lofty and continuous mountain ranges and of great deserts and sometimes even of large rivers we find different productions though as mountain chains deserts c are not as impassable or likely to have endured so long as the oceans separating continents the differences are very inferior in degree to those characteristic of distinct continents turning to the sea we find the same law no two marine faunas are more distinct with hardly a fish shell or crab in common than those of the eastern and western shores of south and central america yet these great faunas are separated only by the narrow but impassable isthmus of panama westward of the shores of america a wide space of open ocean extends with not an island as a halting place for emigrants here we have a barrier of another kind and as soon as this is passed we meet in the eastern islands of the pacific with another and totally distinct fauna so that here three marine faunas range far northward and southward in parallel lines not far from each other under corresponding climates but from being separated from each other by impassable barriers either of land or open sea they are wholly distinct on the other hand proceeding still further westward from the eastern islands of the tropical parts of the pacific we encounter no impassable barriers and we have innumerable islands as halting places or continuous coasts until after travelling over a hemisphere we come to the shores of africa and over this vast space we meet with no well defined and distinct marine faunas although hardly one shell crab or fish is common to the above named three approximate faunas of eastern and western america and the eastern pacific islands yet many fish range from the pacific into the indian ocean and many shells are common to the eastern islands of the pacific 349 and the eastern shores of africa on almost exactly opposite meridians of longitude a third great fact partly included in the foregoing statements is the affinity of the productions of the same continent or sea though the species themselves are distinct at different points and stations it is a law of the widest generality and every continent offers innumerable instances nevertheless the naturalist in travelling for instance from north to south never fails to be struck by the manner in which successive groups of beings specifically distinct yet clearly related replace each other he hears from closely allied yet distinct kinds of birds notes nearly similar and sees their nests similarly constructed but not quite alike with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner the plains near the straits of magellan are inhabited by one species of rhea american ostrich and northward the plains of la plata by another species of the same genus and not by a true ostrich or emu like those found in africa and australia under the same latitude on these same plains of la plata we see the agouti and bizcacha animals having nearly the same habits as our hares and rabbits and belonging to the same order of rodents but they plainly display an american type of structure we ascend the lofty peaks of the cordillera and we find an alpine species of bizcacha we look to the waters and we do not find the beaver or musk rat but the coypu and capybara rodents of the american type innumerable other instances could be given if we look to the islands off the american shore however much they may differ in geological structure the inhabitants though they may be all peculiar species are essentially american we may look back to past ages as shown in the last chapter and we find american types then prevalent on 350 the american continent and in the american seas we see in these facts some deep organic bond prevailing throughout space and time over the same areas of land and water and independent of their physical conditions the naturalist must feel little curiosity who is not led to inquire what this bond is this bond on my theory is simply inheritance that cause which alone as far as we positively know produces organisms quite like or as we see in the case of varieties nearly like each other the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of different regions may be attributed to modification through natural selection and in a quite subordinate degree to the direct influence of different physical conditions the degree of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the more dominant forms of life from one region into another having been effected with more or less ease at periods more or less remote on the nature and number of the former immigrants and on their action and reaction in their mutual struggles for life the relation of organism to organism being as i have already often remarked the most important of all relations thus the high importance of barriers comes into play by checking migration as does time for the slow process of modification through natural selection widely ranging species abounding in individuals which have already triumphed over many competitors in their own widely extended homes will have the best chance of seizing on new places when they spread into new countries in their new homes they will be exposed to new conditions and will frequently undergo further modification and improvement and thus they will become still further victorious and will produce groups of modified descendants on this principle of inheritance with modification we can understand how it is that sections of genera whole genera 351 and even families are confined to the same areas as is so commonly and notoriously the case i believe as was remarked in the last chapter in no law of necessary development as the variability of each species is an independent property and will be taken advantage of by natural selection only so far as it profits the individual in its complex struggle for life so the degree of modification in different species will be no uniform quantity if for instance a number of species which stand in direct competition with each other migrate in a body into a new and afterwards isolated country they will be little liable to modification for neither migration nor isolation in themselves can do anything these principles come into play only by bringing organisms into new relations with each other and in a lesser degree with the surrounding physical conditions as we have seen in the last chapter that some forms have retained nearly the same character from an enormously remote geological period so certain species have migrated over vast spaces and have not become greatly modified on these views it is obvious that the several species of the same genus though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world must originally have proceeded from the same source as they have descended from the same progenitor in the case of those species which have undergone during whole geological periods but little modification there is not much difficulty in believing that they may have migrated from the same region for during the vast geographical and climatal changes which will have supervened since ancient times almost any amount of migration is possible but in many other cases in which we have reason to believe that the species of a genus have been produced within comparatively recent times there is great difficulty on this head it 352 is also obvious that the individuals of the same species though now inhabiting distant and isolated regions must have proceeded from one spot where their parents were first produced for as explained in the last chapter it is incredible that individuals identically the same should ever have been produced through natural selection from parents specifically distinct we are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed by naturalists namely whether species have been created at one or more points of the earth s surface undoubtedly there are very many cases of extreme difficulty in understanding how the same species could possibly have migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolated points where now found nevertheless the simplicity of the view that each species was first produced within a single region captivates the mind he who rejects it rejects the vera causa of ordinary generation with subsequent migration and calls in the agency of a miracle it is universally admitted that in most cases the area inhabited by a species is continuous and when a plant or animal inhabits two points so distant from each other or with an interval of such a nature that the space could not be easily passed over by migration the fact is given as something remarkable and exceptional the capacity of migrating across the sea is more distinctly limited in terrestrial mammals than perhaps in any other organic beings and accordingly we find no inexplicable cases of the same mammal inhabiting distant points of the world no geologist will feel any difficulty in such cases as great britain having been formerly united to europe and consequently possessing the same quadrupeds but if the same species can be produced at two separate points why do we not find a single mammal common to europe and 353 australia or south america the conditions of life are nearly the same so that a multitude of european animals and plants have become naturalised in america and australia and some of the aboriginal plants are identically the same at these distant points of the northern and southern hemispheres the answer as i believe is that mammals have not been able to migrate whereas some plants from their varied means of dispersal have migrated across the vast and broken interspace the great and striking influence which barriers of every kind have had on distribution is intelligible only on the view that the great majority of species have been produced on one side alone and have not been able to migrate to the other side some few families many sub families very many genera and a still greater number of sections of genera are confined to a single region and it has been observed by several naturalists that the most natural genera or those genera in which the species are most closely related to each other are generally local or confined to one area what a strange anomaly it would be if when coming one step lower in the series to the individuals of the same species a directly opposite rule prevailed and species were not local but had been produced in two or more distinct areas hence it seems to me as it has to many other naturalists that the view of each species having been produced in one area alone and having subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted is the most probable undoubtedly many cases occur in which we cannot explain how the same species could have passed from one point to the other but the geographical and climatal changes which have certainly occurred within recent geological times must have interrupted or rendered discontinuous the 354 formerly continuous range of many species so that we are reduced to consider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerous and of so grave a nature that we ought to give up the belief rendered probable by general considerations that each species has been produced within one area and has migrated thence as far as it could it would be hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the same species now living at distant and separated points nor do i for a moment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many such cases but after some preliminary remarks i will discuss a few of the most striking classes of facts namely the existence of the same species on the summits of distant mountain ranges and at distant points in the arctic and antarctic regions and secondly in the following chapter the wide distribution of freshwater productions and thirdly the occurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on the mainland though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea if the existence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the earth s surface can in many instances be explained on the view of each species having migrated from a single birthplace then considering our ignorance with respect to former climatal and geographical changes and various occasional means of transport the belief that this has been the universal law seems to me incomparably the safest in discussing this subject we shall be enabled at the same time to consider a point equally important for us namely whether the several distinct species of a genus which on my theory have all descended from a common progenitor can have migrated undergoing modification during some part of their migration from the area inhabited by their progenitor if it can be shown to be almost invariably the case that a region of which 355 most of its inhabitants are closely related to or belong to the same genera with the species of a second region has probably received at some former period immigrants from this other region my theory will be strengthened for we can clearly understand on the principle of modification why the inhabitants of a region should be related to those of another region whence it has been stocked a volcanic island for instance upheaved and formed at the distance of a few hundreds of miles from a continent would probably receive from it in the course of time a few colonists and their descendants though modified would still be plainly related by inheritance to the inhabitants of the continent cases of this nature are common and are as we shall hereafter more fully see inexplicable on the theory of independent creation this view of the relation of species in one region to those in another does not differ much by substituting the word variety for species from that lately advanced in an ingenious paper by mr wallace in which he concludes that every species has come into existence coincident both in space and time with a pre existing closely allied species and i now know from correspondence that this coincidence he attributes to generation with modification the previous remarks on single and multiple centres of creation do not directly bear on another allied question namely whether all the individuals of the same species have descended from a single pair or single hermaphrodite or whether as some authors suppose from many individuals simultaneously created with those organic beings which never intercross if such exist the species on my theory must have descended from a succession of improved varieties which will never have blended with other individuals or varieties but will have supplanted each other so that at each 356 successive stage of modification and improvement all the individuals of each variety will have descended from a single parent but in the majority of cases namely with all organisms which habitually unite for each birth or which often intercross i believe that during the slow process of modification the individuals of the species will have been kept nearly uniform by intercrossing so that many individuals will have gone on simultaneously changing and the whole amount of modification will not have been due at each stage to descent from a single parent to illustrate what i mean our english racehorses differ slightly from the horses of every other breed but they do not owe their difference and superiority to descent from any single pair but to continued care in selecting and training many individuals during many generations before discussing the three classes of facts which i have selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of single centres of creation i must say a few words on the means of dispersal means of dispersal sir c lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject i can give here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts change of climate must have had a powerful influence on migration a region when its climate was different may have been a high road for migration but now be impassable i shall however presently have to discuss this branch of the subject in some detail changes of level in the land must also have been highly influential a narrow isthmus now separates two marine faunas submerge it or let it formerly have been submerged and the two faunas will now blend or may formerly have blended where the sea now extends land may at a former period have connected islands or 357 possibly even continents together and thus have allowed terrestrial productions to pass from one to the other no geologist will dispute that great mutations of level have occurred within the period of existing organisms edward forbes insisted that all the islands in the atlantic must recently have been connected with europe or africa and europe likewise with america other authors have thus hypothetically bridged over every ocean and have united almost every island to some mainland if indeed the arguments used by forbes are to be trusted it must be admitted that scarcely a single island exists which has not recently been united to some continent this view cuts the gordian knot of the dispersal of the same species to the most distant points and removes many a difficulty but to the best of my judgment we are not authorized in admitting such enormous geographical changes within the period of existing species it seems to me that we have abundant evidence of great oscillations of level in our continents but not of such vast changes in their position and extension as to have united them within the recent period to each other and to the several intervening oceanic islands i freely admit the former existence of many islands now buried beneath the sea which may have served as halting places for plants and for many animals during their migration in the coral producing oceans such sunken islands are now marked as i believe by rings of coral or atolls standing over them whenever it is fully admitted as i believe it will some day be that each species has proceeded from a single birthplace and when in the course of time we know something definite about the means of distribution we shall be enabled to speculate with security on the former extension of the land but i do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the 358 recent period continents which are now quite separate have been continuously or almost continuously united with each other and with the many existing oceanic islands several facts in distribution such as the great difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almost every continent the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants of several lands and even seas to their present inhabitants a certain degree of relation as we shall hereafter see between the distribution of mammals and the depth of the sea these and other such facts seem to me opposed to the admission of such prodigious geographical revolutions within the recent period as are necessitated on the view advanced by forbes and admitted by his many followers the nature and relative proportions of the inhabitants of oceanic islands likewise seem to me opposed to the belief of their former continuity with continents nor does their almost universally volcanic composition favour the admission that they are the wrecks of sunken continents if they had originally existed as mountain ranges on the land some at least of the islands would have been formed like other mountain summits of granite metamorphic schists old fossiliferous or other such rocks instead of consisting of mere piles of volcanic matter i must now say a few words on what are called accidental means but which more properly might be called occasional means of distribution i shall here confine myself to plants in botanical works this or that plant is stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination but for transport across the sea the greater or less facilities may be said to be almost wholly unknown until i tried with mr berkeley s aid a few experiments it was not even known how far seeds could resist the injurious action of sea water to my surprise i found that 359 out of 87 kinds 64 germinated after an immersion of 28 days and a few survived an immersion of 137 days for convenience sake i chiefly tried small seeds without the capsule or fruit and as all of these sank in a few days they could not be floated across wide spaces of the sea whether or not they were injured by the salt water afterwards i tried some larger fruits capsules c and some of these floated for a long time it is well known what a difference there is in the buoyancy of green and seasoned timber and it occurred to me that floods might wash down plants or branches and that these might be dried on the banks and then by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea hence i was led to dry stems and branches of 94 plants with ripe fruit and to place them on sea water the majority sank quickly but some which whilst green floated for a very short time when dried floated much longer for instance ripe hazel nuts sank immediately but when dried they floated for 90 days and afterwards when planted they germinated an asparagus plant with ripe berries floated for 23 days when dried it floated for 85 days and the seeds afterwards germinated the ripe seeds of helosciadium sank in two days when dried they floated for above 90 days and afterwards germinated altogether out of the 94 dried plants 18 floated for above 28 days and some of the 18 floated for a very much longer period so that as 64 87 seeds germinated after an immersion of 28 days and as 18 94 plants with ripe fruit but not all the same species as in the foregoing experiment floated after being dried for above 28 days as far as we may infer anything from these scanty facts we may conclude that the seeds of 14 100 plants of any country might be floated by sea currents during 28 days and would retain their power of germination in johnston s physical atlas the average 360 rate of the several atlantic currents is 33 miles per diem some currents running at the rate of 60 miles per diem on this average the seeds of 14 100 plants belonging to one country might be floated across 924 miles of sea to another country and when stranded if blown to a favourable spot by an inland gale they would germinate subsequently to my experiments m martens tried similar ones but in a much better manner for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea so that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like really floating plants he tried 98 seeds mostly different from mine but he chose many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants which live near the sea and this would have favoured the average length of their flotation and of their resistance to the injurious action of the salt water on the other hand he did not previously dry the plants or branches with the fruit and this as we have seen would have caused some of them to have floated much longer the result was that 18 98 of his seeds floated for 42 days and were then capable of germination but i do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves would float for a less time than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the seeds of about 10 100 plants of a flora after having been dried could be floated across a space of sea 900 miles in width and would then germinate the fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small is interesting as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly be transported by any other means and alph de candolle has shown that such plants generally have restricted ranges but seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner drift timber is thrown up on most islands 361 even on those in the midst of the widest oceans and the natives of the coral islands in the pacific procure stones for their tools solely from the roots of drifted trees these stones being a valuable royal tax i find on examination that when irregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees small parcels of earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices and behind them so perfectly that not a particle could be washed away in the longest transport out of one small portion of earth thus completely enclosed by wood in an oak about 50 years old three dicotyledonous plants germinated i am certain of the accuracy of this observation again i can show that the carcasses of birds when floating on the sea sometimes escape being immediately devoured and seeds of many kinds in the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality peas and vetches for instance are killed by even a few days immersion in sea water but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon which had floated on artificial salt water for 30 days to my surprise nearly all germinated living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in the transportation of seeds i could give many facts showing how frequently birds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across the ocean we may i think safely assume that under such circumstances their rate of flight would often be 35 miles an hour and some authors have given a far higher estimate i have never seen an instance of nutritious seeds passing through the intestines of a bird but hard seeds of fruit pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey in the course of two months i picked up in my garden 12 kinds of seeds out of the excrement of small birds and these seemed perfect and some of them which i tried germinated 362 but the following fact is more important the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice and do not in the least injure as i know by trial the germination of seeds now after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food it is positively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for 12 or even 18 hours a bird in this interval might easily be blown to the distance of 500 miles and hawks are known to look out for tired birds and the contents of their torn crops might thus readily get scattered mr brent informs me that a friend of his had to give up flying carrier pigeons from france to england as the hawks on the english coast destroyed so many on their arrival some hawks and owls bolt their prey whole and after an interval of from twelve to twenty hours disgorge pellets which as i know from experiments made in the zoological gardens include seeds capable of germination some seeds of the oat wheat millet canary hemp clover and beet germinated after having been from twelve to twenty one hours in the stomachs of different birds of prey and two seeds of beet grew after having been thus retained for two days and fourteen hours freshwater fish i find eat seeds of many land and water plants fish are frequently devoured by birds and thus the seeds might be transported from place to place i forced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish and then gave their bodies to fishing eagles storks and pelicans these birds after an interval of many hours either rejected the seeds in pellets or passed them in their excrement and several of these seeds retained their power of germination certain seeds however were always killed by this process although the beaks and feet of birds are generally quite clean i can show that earth sometimes adheres to them in one instance i removed twenty two grains 363 of dry argillaceous earth from one foot of a partridge and in this earth there was a pebble quite as large as the seed of a vetch thus seeds might occasionally be transported to great distances for many facts could be given showing that soil almost everywhere is charged with seeds reflect for a moment on the millions of quails which annually cross the mediterranean and can we doubt that the earth adhering to their feet would sometimes include a few minute seeds but i shall presently have to recur to this subject as icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones and have even carried brushwood bones and the nest of a land bird i can hardly doubt that they must occasionally have transported seeds from one part to another of the arctic and antarctic regions as suggested by lyell and during the glacial period from one part of the now temperate regions to another in the azores from the large number of the species of plants common to europe in comparison with the plants of other oceanic islands nearer to the mainland and as remarked by mr h c watson from the somewhat northern character of the flora in comparison with the latitude i suspected that these islands had been partly stocked by ice borne seeds during the glacial epoch at my request sir c lyell wrote to m hartung to inquire whether he had observed erratic boulders on these islands and he answered that he had found large fragments of granite and other rocks which do not occur in the archipelago hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landed their rocky burthens on the shores of these mid ocean islands and it is at least possible that they may have brought thither the seeds of northern plants considering that the several above means of transport and that several other means which without 364 doubt remain to be discovered have been in action year after year for centuries and tens of thousands of years it would i think be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thus become widely transported these means of transport are sometimes called accidental but this is not strictly correct the currents of the sea are not accidental nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind it should be observed that scarcely any means of transport would carry seeds for very great distances for seeds do not retain their vitality when exposed for a great length of time to the action of sea water nor could they be long carried in the crops or intestines of birds these means however would suffice for occasional transport across tracts of sea some hundred miles in breadth or from island to island or from a continent to a neighbouring island but not from one distant continent to another the floras of distant continents would not by such means become mingled in any great degree but would remain as distinct as we now see them to be the currents from their course would never bring seeds from north america to britain though they might and do bring seeds from the west indies to our western shores where if not killed by so long an immersion in salt water they could not endure our climate almost every year one or two land birds are blown across the whole atlantic ocean from north america to the western shores of ireland and england but seeds could be transported by these wanderers only by one means namely in dirt sticking to their feet which is in itself a rare accident even in this case how small would the chance be of a seed falling on favourable soil and coming to maturity but it would be a great error to argue that because a well stocked island like great britain has not as far as is known 365 and it would be very difficult to prove this received within the last few centuries through occasional means of transport immigrants from europe or any other continent that a poorly stocked island though standing more remote from the mainland would not receive colonists by similar means i do not doubt that out of twenty seeds or animals transported to an island even if far less well stocked than britain scarcely more than one would be so well fitted to its new home as to become naturalised but this as it seems to me is no valid argument against what would be effected by occasional means of transport during the long lapse of geological time whilst an island was being upheaved and formed and before it had become fully stocked with inhabitants on almost bare land with few or no destructive insects or birds living there nearly every seed which chanced to arrive if fitted for the climate would be sure to germinate and survive dispersal during the glacial period the identity of many plants and animals on mountain summits separated from each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands where the alpine species could not possibly exist is one of the most striking cases known of the same species living at distant points without the apparent possibility of their having migrated from one to the other it is indeed a remarkable fact to see so many of the same plants living on the snowy regions of the alps or pyrenees and in the extreme northern parts of europe but it is far more remarkable that the plants on the white mountains in the united states of america are all the same with those of labrador and nearly all the same as we hear from asa gray with those on the loftiest mountains of europe even as long ago as 1747 such facts led gmelin to conclude that the 366 same species must have been independently created at several distinct points and we might have remained in this same belief had not agassiz and others called vivid attention to the glacial period which as we shall immediately see affords a simple explanation of these facts we have evidence of almost every conceivable kind organic and inorganic that within a very recent geological period central europe and north america suffered under an arctic climate the ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell their tale more plainly than do the mountains of scotland and wales with their scored flanks polished surfaces and perched boulders of the icy streams with which their valleys were lately filled so greatly has the climate of europe changed that in northern italy gigantic moraines left by old glaciers are now clothed by the vine and maize throughout a large part of the united states erratic boulders and rocks scored by drifted icebergs and coast ice plainly reveal a former cold period the former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of the inhabitants of europe as explained with remarkable clearness by edward forbes is substantially as follows but we shall follow the changes more readily by supposing a new glacial period to come slowly on and then pass away as formerly occurred as the cold came on and as each more southern zone became fitted for arctic beings and ill fitted for their former more temperate inhabitants the latter would be supplanted and arctic productions would take their places the inhabitants of the more temperate regions would at the same time travel southward unless they were stopped by barriers in which case they would perish the mountains would become covered with snow and ice and their former alpine inhabitants would descend to the plains by the time that the cold had reached 367 its maximum we should have a uniform arctic fauna and flora covering the central parts of europe as far south as the alps and pyrenees and even stretching into spain the now temperate regions of the united states would likewise be covered by arctic plants and animals and these would be nearly the same with those of europe for the present circumpolar inhabitants which we suppose to have everywhere travelled southward are remarkably uniform round the world we may suppose that the glacial period came on a little earlier or later in north america than in europe so will the southern migration there have been a little earlier or later but this will make no difference in the final result as the warmth returned the arctic forms would retreat northward closely followed up in their retreat by the productions of the more temperate regions and as the snow melted from the bases of the mountains the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawed ground always ascending higher and higher as the warmth increased whilst their brethren were pursuing their northern journey hence when the warmth had fully returned the same arctic species which had lately lived in a body together on the lowlands of the old and new worlds would be left isolated on distant mountain summits having been exterminated on all lesser heights and in the arctic regions of both hemispheres thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points so immensely remote as on the mountains of the united states and of europe we can thus also understand the fact that the alpine plants of each mountain range are more especially related to the arctic forms living due north or nearly due north of them for the migration as the cold came on and the re migration on the returning warmth will generally 368 have been due south and north the alpine plants for example of scotland as remarked by mr h c watson and those of the pyrenees as remarked by ramond are more especially allied to the plants of northern scandinavia those of the united states to labrador those of the mountains of siberia to the arctic regions of that country these views grounded as they are on the perfectly well ascertained occurrence of a former glacial period seem to me to explain in so satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the alpine and arctic productions of europe and america that when in other regions we find the same species on distant mountain summits we may almost conclude without other evidence that a colder climate permitted their former migration across the low intervening tracts since become too warm for their existence if the climate since the glacial period has ever been in any degree warmer than at present as some geologists in the united states believe to have been the case chiefly from the distribution of the fossil gnathodon then the arctic and temperate productions will at a very late period have marched a little further north and subsequently have retreated to their present homes but i have met with no satisfactory evidence with respect to this intercalated slightly warmer period since the glacial period the arctic forms during their long southern migration and re migration northward will have been exposed to nearly the same climate and as is especially to be noticed they will have kept in a body together consequently their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed and in accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume they will not have been liable to much modification but with our alpine productions left isolated from the moment of the returning warmth 369 first at the bases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains the case will have been somewhat different for it is not likely that all the same arctic species will have been left on mountain ranges distant from each other and have survived there ever since they will also in all probability have become mingled with ancient alpine species which must have existed on the mountains before the commencement of the glacial epoch and which during its coldest period will have been temporarily driven down to the plains they will also have been exposed to somewhat different climatal influences their mutual relations will thus have been in some degree disturbed consequently they will have been liable to modification and this we find has been the case for if we compare the present alpine plants and animals of the several great european mountain ranges though very many of the species are identically the same some present varieties some are ranked as doubtful forms and some few are distinct yet closely allied or representative species in illustrating what as i believe actually took place during the glacial period i assumed that at its commencement the arctic productions were as uniform round the polar regions as they are at the present day but the foregoing remarks on distribution apply not only to strictly arctic forms but also to many sub arctic and to some few northern temperate forms for some of these are the same on the lower mountains and on the plains of north america and europe and it may be reasonably asked how i account for the necessary degree of uniformity of the sub arctic and northern temperate forms round the world at the commencement of the glacial period at the present day the sub arctic and northern temperate productions of the old and new worlds are separated from each other by the 370 atlantic ocean and by the extreme northern part of the pacific during the glacial period when the inhabitants of the old and new worlds lived further southwards than at present they must have been still more completely separated by wider spaces of ocean i believe the above difficulty may be surmounted by looking to still earlier changes of climate of an opposite nature we have good reason to believe that during the newer pliocene period before the glacial epoch and whilst the majority of the inhabitants of the world were specifically the same as now the climate was warmer than at the present day hence we may suppose that the organisms now living under the climate of latitude 60в during the pliocene period lived further north under the polar circle in latitude 66в 67в and that the strictly arctic productions then lived on the broken land still nearer to the pole now if we look at a globe we shall see that under the polar circle there is almost continuous land from western europe through siberia to eastern america and to this continuity of the circumpolar land and to the consequent freedom for intermigration under a more favourable climate i attribute the necessary amount of uniformity in the sub arctic and northern temperate productions of the old and new worlds at a period anterior to the glacial epoch believing from reasons before alluded to that our continents have long remained in nearly the same relative position though subjected to large but partial oscillations of level i am strongly inclined to extend the above view and to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period such as the older pliocene period a large number of the same plants and animals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land and that these plants and animals both in the old and 371 new worlds began slowly to migrate southwards as the climate became less warm long before the commencement of the glacial period we now see as i believe their descendants mostly in a modified condition in the central parts of europe and the united states on this view we can understand the relationship with very little identity between the productions of north america and europe a relationship which is most remarkable considering the distance of the two areas and their separation by the atlantic ocean we can further understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers that the productions of europe and america during the later tertiary stages were more closely related to each other than they are at the present time for during these warmer periods the northern parts of the old and new worlds will have been almost continuously united by land serving as a bridge since rendered impassable by cold for the intermigration of their inhabitants during the slowly decreasing warmth of the pliocene period as soon as the species in common which inhabited the new and old worlds migrated south of the polar circle they must have been completely cut off from each other this separation as far as the more temperate productions are concerned took place long ages ago and as the plants and animals migrated southward they will have become mingled in the one great region with the native american productions and have had to compete with them and in the other great region with those of the old world consequently we have here everything favourable for much modification for far more modification than with the alpine productions left isolated within a much more recent period on the several mountain ranges and on the arctic lands of the two worlds hence it has come that when we compare 372 the now living productions of the temperate regions of the new and old worlds we find very few identical species though asa gray has lately shown that more plants are identical than was formerly supposed but we find in every great class many forms which some naturalists rank as geographical races and others as distinct species and a host of closely allied or representative forms which are ranked by all naturalists as specifically distinct as on the land so in the waters of the sea a slow southern migration of a marine fauna which during the pliocene or even a somewhat earlier period was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the polar circle will account on the theory of modification for many closely allied forms now living in areas completely sundered thus i think we can understand the presence of many existing and tertiary representative forms on the eastern and western shores of temperate north america and the still more striking case of many closely allied crustaceans as described in dana s admirable work of some fish and other marine animals in the mediterranean and in the seas of japan areas now separated by a continent and by nearly a hemisphere of equatorial ocean these cases of relationship without identity of the inhabitants of seas now disjoined and likewise of the past and present inhabitants of the temperate lands of north america and europe are inexplicable on the theory of creation we cannot say that they have been created alike in correspondence with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas for if we compare for instance certain parts of south america with the southern continents of the old world we see countries closely corresponding in all their physical conditions but with their inhabitants utterly dissimilar 373 but we must return to our more immediate subject the glacial period i am convinced that forbes s view may be largely extended in europe we have the plainest evidence of the cold period from the western shores of britain to the oural range and southward to the pyrenees we may infer from the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation that siberia was similarly affected along the himalaya at points 900 miles apart glaciers have left the marks of their former low descent and in sikkim dr hooker saw maize growing on gigantic ancient moraines south of the equator we have some direct evidence of former glacial action in new zealand and the same plants found on widely separated mountains in that island tell the same story if one account which has been published can be trusted we have direct evidence of glacial action in the south eastern corner of australia looking to america in the northern half ice borne fragments of rock have been observed on the eastern side as far south as lat 36в 37в and on the shores of the pacific where the climate is now so different as far south as lat 46в erratic boulders have also been noticed on the rocky mountains in the cordillera of equatorial south america glaciers once extended far below their present level in central chili i was astonished at the structure of a vast mound of detritus about 800 feet in height crossing a valley of the andes and this i now feel convinced was a gigantic moraine left far below any existing glacier further south on both sides of the continent from lat 41в to the southernmost extremity we have the clearest evidence of former glacial action in huge boulders transported far from their parent source we do not know that the glacial epoch was strictly simultaneous at these several far distant points on 374 opposite sides of the world but we have good evidence in almost every case that the epoch was included within the latest geological period we have also excellent evidence that it endured for an enormous time as measured by years at each point the cold may have come on or have ceased earlier at one point of the globe than at another but seeing that it endured for long at each and that it was contemporaneous in a geological sense it seems to me probable that it was during a part at least of the period actually simultaneous throughout the world without some distinct evidence to the contrary we may at least admit as probable that the glacial action was simultaneous on the eastern and western sides of north america in the cordillera under the equator and under the warmer temperate zones and on both sides of the southern extremity of the continent if this be admitted it is difficult to avoid believing that the temperature of the whole world was at this period simultaneously cooler but it would suffice for my purpose if the temperature was at the same time lower along certain broad belts of longitude on this view of the whole world or at least of broad longitudinal belts having been simultaneously colder from pole to pole much light can be thrown on the present distribution of identical and allied species in america dr hooker has shown that between forty and fifty of the flowering plants of tierra del fuego forming no inconsiderable part of its scanty flora are common to europe enormously remote as these two points are and there are many closely allied species on the lofty mountains of equatorial america a host of peculiar species belonging to european genera occur on the highest mountains of brazil some few european genera were found by gardner which do not exist in the wide 375 intervening hot countries so on the silla of caraccas the illustrious humboldt long ago found species belonging to genera characteristic of the cordillera on the mountains of abyssinia several european forms and some few representatives of the peculiar flora of the cape of good hope occur at the cape of good hope a very few european species believed not to have been introduced by man and on the mountains some few representative european forms are found which have not been discovered in the intertropical parts of africa on the himalaya and on the isolated mountain ranges of the peninsula of india on the heights of ceylon and on the volcanic cones of java many plants occur either identically the same or representing each other and at the same time representing plants of europe not found in the intervening hot lowlands a list of the genera collected on the loftier peaks of java raises a picture of a collection made on a hill in europe still more striking is the fact that southern australian forms are clearly represented by plants growing on the summits of the mountains of borneo some of these australian forms as i hear from dr hooker extend along the heights of the peninsula of malacca and are thinly scattered on the one hand over india and on the other as far north as japan on the southern mountains of australia dr f mгјller has discovered several european species other species not introduced by man occur on the lowlands and a long list can be given as i am informed by dr hooker of european genera found in australia but not in the intermediate torrid regions in the admirable introduction to the flora of new zealand by dr hooker analogous and striking facts are given in regard to the plants of that large island hence we see that throughout the world the plants growing on the 376 more lofty mountains and on the temperate lowlands of the northern and southern hemispheres are sometimes identically the same but they are much oftener specifically distinct though related to each other in a most remarkable manner this brief abstract applies to plants alone some strictly analogous facts could be given on the distribution of terrestrial animals in marine productions similar cases occur as an example i may quote a remark by the highest authority prof dana that it is certainly a wonderful fact that new zealand should have a closer resemblance in its crustacea to great britain its antipode than to any other part of the world sir j richardson also speaks of the reappearance on the shores of new zealand tasmania c of northern forms of fish dr hooker informs me that twenty five species of algг are common to new zealand and to europe but have not been found in the intermediate tropical seas it should be observed that the northern species and forms found in the southern parts of the southern hemisphere and on the mountain ranges of the intertropical regions are not arctic but belong to the northern temperate zones as mr h c watson has recently remarked in receding from polar towards equatorial latitudes the alpine or mountain floras really become less and less arctic many of the forms living on the mountains of the warmer regions of the earth and in the southern hemisphere are of doubtful value being ranked by some naturalists as specifically distinct by others as varieties but some are certainly identical and many though closely related to northern forms must be ranked as distinct species now let us see what light can be thrown on the foregoing facts on the belief supported as it is by a large 377 body of geological evidence that the whole world or a large part of it was during the glacial period simultaneously much colder than at present the glacial period as measured by years must have been very long and when we remember over what vast spaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread within a few centuries this period will have been ample for any amount of migration as the cold came slowly on all the tropical plants and other productions will have retreated from both sides towards the equator followed in the rear by the temperate productions and these by the arctic but with the latter we are not now concerned the tropical plants probably suffered much extinction how much no one can say perhaps formerly the tropics supported as many species as we see at the present day crowded together at the cape of good hope and in parts of temperate australia as we know that many tropical plants and animals can withstand a considerable amount of cold many might have escaped extermination during a moderate fall of temperature more especially by escaping into the lowest most protected and warmest districts but the great fact to bear in mind is that all tropical productions will have suffered to a certain extent on the other hand the temperate productions after migrating nearer to the equator though they will have been placed under somewhat new conditions will have suffered less and it is certain that many temperate plants if protected from the inroads of competitors can withstand a much warmer climate than their own hence it seems to me possible bearing in mind that the tropical productions were in a suffering state and could not have presented a firm front against intruders that a certain number of the more vigorous and dominant temperate forms might have penetrated the native ranks and have reached or 378 even crossed the equator the invasion would of course have been greatly favoured by high land and perhaps by a dry climate for dr falconer informs me that it is the damp with the heat of the tropics which is so destructive to perennial plants from a temperate climate on the other hand the most humid and hottest districts will have afforded an asylum to the tropical natives the mountain ranges north west of the himalaya and the long line of the cordillera seem to have afforded two great lines of invasion and it is a striking fact lately communicated to me by dr hooker that all the flowering plants about forty six in number common to tierra del fuego and to europe still exist in north america which must have lain on the line of march but i do not doubt that some temperate productions entered and crossed even the lowlands of the tropics at the period when the cold was most intense when arctic forms had migrated some twenty five degrees of latitude from their native country and covered the land at the foot of the pyrenees at this period of extreme cold i believe that the climate under the equator at the level of the sea was about the same with that now felt there at the height of six or seven thousand feet during this the coldest period i suppose that large spaces of the tropical lowlands were clothed with a mingled tropical and temperate vegetation like that now growing with strange luxuriance at the base of the himalaya as graphically described by hooker thus as i believe a considerable number of plants a few terrestrial animals and some marine productions migrated during the glacial period from the northern and southern temperate zones into the intertropical regions and some even crossed the equator as the warmth returned these temperate forms would naturally ascend the higher mountains being exterminated on the 379 lowlands those which had not reached the equator would re migrate northward or southward towards their former homes but the forms chiefly northern which had crossed the equator would travel still further from their homes into the more temperate latitudes of the opposite hemisphere although we have reason to believe from geological evidence that the whole body of arctic shells underwent scarcely any modification during their long southern migration and re migration northward the case may have been wholly different with those intruding forms which settled themselves on the intertropical mountains and in the southern hemisphere these being surrounded by strangers will have had to compete with many new forms of life and it is probable that selected modifications in their structure habits and constitutions will have profited them thus many of these wanderers though still plainly related by inheritance to their brethren of the northern or southern hemispheres now exist in their new homes as well marked varieties or as distinct species it is a remarkable fact strongly insisted on by hooker in regard to america and by alph de candolle in regard to australia that many more identical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from the north to the south than in a reversed direction we see however a few southern vegetable forms on the mountains of borneo and abyssinia i suspect that this preponderant migration from north to south is due to the greater extent of land in the north and to the northern forms having existed in their own homes in greater numbers and having consequently been advanced through natural selection and competition to a higher stage of perfection or dominating power than the southern forms and thus when they became commingled during the glacial period the northern forms 380 were enabled to beat the less powerful southern forms just in the same manner as we see at the present day that very many european productions cover the ground in la plata and in a lesser degree in australia and have to a certain extent beaten the natives whereas extremely few southern forms have become naturalised in any part of europe though hides wool and other objects likely to carry seeds have been largely imported into europe during the last two or three centuries from la plata and during the last thirty or forty years from australia something of the same kind must have occurred on the intertropical mountains no doubt before the glacial period they were stocked with endemic alpine forms but these have almost everywhere largely yielded to the more dominant forms generated in the larger areas and more efficient workshops of the north in many islands the native productions are nearly equalled or even outnumbered by the naturalised and if the natives have not been actually exterminated their numbers have been greatly reduced and this is the first stage towards extinction a mountain is an island on the land and the intertropical mountains before the glacial period must have been completely isolated and i believe that the productions of these islands on the land yielded to those produced within the larger areas of the north just in the same way as the productions of real islands have everywhere lately yielded to continental forms naturalised by man s agency i am far from supposing that all difficulties are removed on the view here given in regard to the range and affinities of the allied species which live in the northern and southern temperate zones and on the mountains of the intertropical regions very many difficulties remain to be solved i do not pretend to 381 indicate the exact lines and means of migration or the reason why certain species and not others have migrated why certain species have been modified and have given rise to new groups of forms and others have remained unaltered we cannot hope to explain such facts until we can say why one species and not another becomes naturalised by man s agency in a foreign land why one ranges twice or thrice as far and is twice or thrice as common as another species within their own homes i have said that many difficulties remain to be solved some of the most remarkable are stated with admirable clearness by dr hooker in his botanical works on the antarctic regions these cannot be here discussed i will only say that as far as regards the occurrence of identical species at points so enormously remote as kerguelen land new zealand and fuegia i believe that towards the close of the glacial period icebergs as suggested by lyell have been largely concerned in their dispersal but the existence of several quite distinct species belonging to genera exclusively confined to the south at these and other distant points of the southern hemisphere is on my theory of descent with modification a far more remarkable case of difficulty for some of these species are so distinct that we cannot suppose that there has been time since the commencement of the glacial period for their migration and for their subsequent modification to the necessary degree the facts seem to me to indicate that peculiar and very distinct species have migrated in radiating lines from some common centre and i am inclined to look in the southern as in the northern hemisphere to a former and warmer period before the commencement of the glacial period when the antarctic lands now covered with ice supported a highly peculiar 382 and isolated flora i suspect that before this flora was exterminated by the glacial epoch a few forms were widely dispersed to various points of the southern hemisphere by occasional means of transport and by the aid as halting places of existing and now sunken islands by these means as i believe the southern shores of america australia new zealand have become slightly tinted by the same peculiar forms of vegetable life sir c lyell in a striking passage has speculated in language almost identical with mine on the effects of great alternations of climate on geographical distribution i believe that the world has recently felt one of his great cycles of change and that on this view combined with modification through natural selection a multitude of facts in the present distribution both of the same and of allied forms of life can be explained the living waters may be said to have flowed during one short period from the north and from the south and to have crossed at the equator but to have flowed with greater force from the north so as to have freely inundated the south as the tide leaves its drift in horizontal lines though rising higher on the shores where the tide rises highest so have the living waters left their living drift on our mountain summits in a line gently rising from the arctic lowlands to a great height under the equator the various beings thus left stranded may be compared with savage races of man driven up and surviving in the mountain fastnesses of almost every land which serve as a record full of interest to us of the former inhabitants of the surrounding lowlands 383 chapter xii geographical distribution continued distribution of fresh water productions on the inhabitants of oceanic islands absence of batrachians and of terrestrial mammals on the relation of the inhabitants of islands to those of the nearest mainland on colonisation from the nearest source with subsequent modification summary of the last and present chapters as lakes and river systems are separated from each other by barriers of land it might have been thought that fresh water productions would not have ranged widely within the same country and as the sea is apparently a still more impassable barrier that they never would have extended to distant countries but the case is exactly the reverse not only have many fresh water species belonging to quite different classes an enormous range but allied species prevail in a remarkable manner throughout the world i well remember when first collecting in the fresh waters of brazil feeling much surprise at the similarity of the fresh water insects shells c and at the dissimilarity of the surrounding terrestrial beings compared with those of britain but this power in fresh water productions of ranging widely though so unexpected can i think in most cases be explained by their having become fitted in a manner highly useful to them for short and frequent migrations from pond to pond or from stream to stream and liability to wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessary consequence we can here consider only a few cases in regard to 384 fish i believe that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of distant continents but on the same continent the species often range widely and almost capriciously for two river systems will have some fish in common and some different a few facts seem to favour the possibility of their occasional transport by accidental means like that of the live fish not rarely dropped by whirlwinds in india and the vitality of their ova when removed from the water but i am inclined to attribute the dispersal of fresh water fish mainly to slight changes within the recent period in the level of the land having caused rivers to flow into each other instances also could be given of this having occurred during floods without any change of level we have evidence in the loess of the rhine of considerable changes of level in the land within a very recent geological period and when the surface was peopled by existing land and fresh water shells the wide difference of the fish on opposite sides of continuous mountain ranges which from an early period must have parted river systems and completely prevented their inosculation seems to lead to this same conclusion with respect to allied fresh water fish occurring at very distant points of the world no doubt there are many cases which cannot at present be explained but some fresh water fish belong to very ancient forms and in such cases there will have been ample time for great geographical changes and consequently time and means for much migration in the second place salt water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in fresh water and according to valenciennes there is hardly a single group of fishes confined exclusively to fresh water so that we may imagine that a marine member of a fresh water group might travel far along the shores of the sea and 385 subsequently become modified and adapted to the fresh waters of a distant land some species of fresh water shells have a very wide range and allied species which on my theory are descended from a common parent and must have proceeded from a single source prevail throughout the world their distribution at first perplexed me much as their ova are not likely to be transported by birds and they are immediately killed by sea water as are the adults i could not even understand how some naturalised species have rapidly spread throughout the same country but two facts which i have observed and no doubt many others remain to be observed throw some light on this subject when a duck suddenly emerges from a pond covered with duck weed i have twice seen these little plants adhering to its back and it has happened to me in removing a little duckweed from one aquarium to another that i have quite unintentionally stocked the one with fresh water shells from the other but another agency is perhaps more effectual i suspended a duck s feet which might represent those of a bird sleeping in a natural pond in an aquarium where many ova of fresh water shells were hatching and i found that numbers of the extremely minute and just hatched shells crawled on the feet and clung to them so firmly that when taken out of the water they could not be jarred off though at a somewhat more advanced age they would voluntarily drop off these just hatched molluscs though aquatic in their nature survived on the duck s feet in damp air from twelve to twenty hours and in this length of time a duck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles and would be sure to alight on a pool or rivulet if blown across sea to an oceanic island or to any other distant point sir charles lyell also 386 informs me that a dyticus has been caught with an ancylus a fresh water shell like a limpet firmly adhering to it and a water beetle of the same family a colymbetes once flew on board the beagle when forty five miles distant from the nearest land how much farther it might have flown with a favouring gale no one can tell with respect to plants it has long been known what enormous ranges many fresh water and even marsh species have both over continents and to the most remote oceanic islands this is strikingly shown as remarked by alph de candolle in large groups of terrestrial plants which have only a very few aquatic members for these latter seem immediately to acquire as if in consequence a very wide range i think favourable means of dispersal explain this fact i have before mentioned that earth occasionally though rarely adheres in some quantity to the feet and beaks of birds wading birds which frequent the muddy edges of ponds if suddenly flushed would be the most likely to have muddy feet birds of this order i can show are the greatest wanderers and are occasionally found on the most remote and barren islands in the open ocean they would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea so that the dirt would not be washed off their feet when making land they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh water haunts i do not believe that botanists are aware how charged the mud of ponds is with seeds i have tried several little experiments but will here give only the most striking case i took in february three table spoonfuls of mud from three different points beneath water on the edge of a little pond this mud when dry weighed only 6вѕ ounces i kept it covered up in my study for six months pulling up and counting each plant as it grew the plants were 387 of many kinds and were altogether 537 in number and yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup considering these facts i think it would be an inexplicable circumstance if water birds did not transport the seeds of fresh water plants to vast distances and if consequently the range of these plants was not very great the same agency may have come into play with the eggs of some of the smaller fresh water animals other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part i have stated that fresh water fish eat some kinds of seeds though they reject many other kinds after having swallowed them even small fish swallow seeds of moderate size as of the yellow water lily and potamogeton herons and other birds century after century have gone on daily devouring fish they then take flight and go to other waters or are blown across the sea and we have seen that seeds retain their power of germination when rejected in pellets or in excrement many hours afterwards when i saw the great size of the seeds of that fine water lily the nelumbium and remembered alph de candolle s remarks on this plant i thought that its distribution must remain quite inexplicable but audubon states that he found the seeds of the great southern water lily probably according to dr hooker the nelumbium luteum in a heron s stomach although i do not know the fact yet analogy makes me believe that a heron flying to another pond and getting a hearty meal of fish would probably reject from its stomach a pellet containing the seeds of the nelumbium undigested or the seeds might be dropped by the bird whilst feeding its young in the same way as fish are known sometimes to be dropped in considering these several means of distribution 388 it should be remembered that when a pond or stream is first formed for instance on a rising islet it will be unoccupied and a single seed or egg will have a good chance of succeeding although there will always be a struggle for life between the individuals of the species however few already occupying any pond yet as the number of kinds is small compared with those on the land the competition will probably be less severe between aquatic than between terrestrial species consequently an intruder from the waters of a foreign country would have a better chance of seizing on a place than in the case of terrestrial colonists we should also remember that some perhaps many freshwater productions are low in the scale of nature and that we have reason to believe that such low beings change or become modified less quickly than the high and this will give longer time than the average for the migration of the same aquatic species we should not forget the probability of many species having formerly ranged as continuously as fresh water productions ever can range over immense areas and having subsequently become extinct in intermediate regions but the wide distribution of fresh water plants and of the lower animals whether retaining the same identical form or in some degree modified i believe mainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals more especially by fresh water birds which have large powers of flight and naturally travel from one to another and often distant piece of water nature like a careful gardener thus takes her seeds from a bed of a particular nature and drops them in another equally well fitted for them on the inhabitants of oceanic islands we now come to the last of the three classes of facts which i 389 have selected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the view that all the individuals both of the same and of allied species have descended from a single parent and therefore have all proceeded from a common birthplace notwithstanding that in the course of time they have come to inhabit distant points of the globe i have already stated that i cannot honestly admit forbes s view on continental extensions which if legitimately followed out would lead to the belief that within the recent period all existing islands have been nearly or quite joined to some continent this view would remove many difficulties but it would not i think explain all the facts in regard to insular productions in the following remarks i shall not confine myself to the mere question of dispersal but shall consider some other facts which bear on the truth of the two theories of independent creation and of descent with modification the species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in number compared with those on equal continental areas alph de candolle admits this for plants and wollaston for insects if we look to the large size and varied stations of new zealand extending over 780 miles of latitude and compare its flowering plants only 750 in number with those on an equal area at the cape of good hope or in australia we must i think admit that something quite independently of any difference in physical conditions has caused so great a difference in number even the uniform county of cambridge has 847 plants and the little island of anglesea 764 but a few ferns and a few introduced plants are included in these numbers and the comparison in some other respects is not quite fair we have evidence that the barren island of ascension aboriginally possessed under half a dozen flowering plants 390 yet many have become naturalised on it as they have on new zealand and on every other oceanic island which can be named in st helena there is reason to believe that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly or quite exterminated many native productions he who admits the doctrine of the creation of each separate species will have to admit that a sufficient number of the best adapted plants and animals have not been created on oceanic islands for man has unintentionally stocked them from various sources far more fully and perfectly than has nature although in oceanic islands the number of kinds of inhabitants is scanty the proportion of endemic species i e those found nowhere else in the world is often extremely large if we compare for instance the number of the endemic land shells in madeira or of the endemic birds in the galapagos archipelago with the number found on any continent and then compare the area of the islands with that of the continent we shall see that this is true this fact might have been expected on my theory for as already explained species occasionally arriving after long intervals in a new and isolated district and having to compete with new associates will be eminently liable to modification and will often produce groups of modified descendants but it by no means follows that because in an island nearly all the species of one class are peculiar those of another class or of another section of the same class are peculiar and this difference seems to depend partly on the species which do not become modified having immigrated with facility and in a body so that their mutual relations have not been much disturbed and partly on the frequent arrival of unmodified immigrants from the mother country and the consequent intercrossing with them with respect to the effects of this intercrossing 391 it should be remembered that the offspring of such crosses would almost certainly gain in vigour so that even an occasional cross would produce more effect than might at first have been anticipated to give a few examples in the galapagos islands nearly every land bird but only two out of the eleven marine birds are peculiar and it is obvious that marine birds could arrive at these islands more easily than land birds bermuda on the other hand which lies at about the same distance from north america as the galapagos islands do from south america and which has a very peculiar soil does not possess one endemic land bird and we know from mr j m jones s admirable account of bermuda that very many north american birds during their great annual migrations visit either periodically or occasionally this island madeira does not possess one peculiar bird and many european and african birds are almost every year blown there as i am informed by mr e v harcourt so that these two islands of bermuda and madeira have been stocked by birds which for long ages have struggled together in their former homes and have become mutually adapted to each other and when settled in their new homes each kind will have been kept by the others to their proper places and habits and will consequently have been little liable to modification any tendency to modification will also have been checked by intercrossing with the unmodified immigrants from the mother country madeira again is inhabited by a wonderful number of peculiar land shells whereas not one species of sea shell is confined to its shores now though we do not know how sea shells are dispersed yet we can see that their eggs or larvae perhaps attached to seaweed or floating timber or to the feet of wading birds might be transported far more easily than 392 land shells across three or four hundred miles of open sea the different orders of insects in madeira apparently present analogous facts oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in certain classes and their places are apparently occupied by the other inhabitants in the galapagos islands reptiles and in new zealand gigantic wingless birds take the place of mammals in the plants of the galapagos islands dr hooker has shown that the proportional numbers of the different orders are very different from what they are elsewhere such cases are generally accounted for by the physical conditions of the islands but this explanation seems to me not a little doubtful facility of immigration i believe has been at least as important as the nature of the conditions many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of remote islands for instance in certain islands not tenanted by mammals some of the endemic plants have beautifully hooked seeds yet few relations are more striking than the adaptation of hooked seeds for transportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds this case presents no difficulty on my view for a hooked seed might be transported to an island by some other means and the plant then becoming slightly modified but still retaining its hooked seeds would form an endemic species having as useless an appendage as any rudimentary organ for instance as the shrivelled wings under the soldered elytra of many insular beetles again islands often possess trees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere include only herbaceous species now trees as alph de candolle has shown generally have whatever the cause may be confined ranges hence trees would be little likely to reach distant oceanic islands and an herbaceous plant though it would have no chance of 393 successfully competing in stature with a fully developed tree when established on an island and having to compete with herbaceous plants alone might readily gain an advantage by growing taller and taller and overtopping the other plants if so natural selection would often tend to add to the stature of herbaceous plants when growing on an oceanic island to whatever order they belonged and thus convert them first into bushes and ultimately into trees with respect to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands bory st vincent long ago remarked that batrachians frogs toads newts have never been found on any of the many islands with which the great oceans are studded i have taken pains to verify this assertion and i have found it strictly true i have however been assured that a frog exists on the mountains of the great island of new zealand but i suspect that this exception if the information be correct may be explained through glacial agency this general absence of frogs toads and newts on so many oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their physical conditions indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly well fitted for these animals for frogs have been introduced into madeira the azores and mauritius and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance but as these animals and their spawn are known to be immediately killed by sea water on my view we can see that there would be great difficulty in their transportal across the sea and therefore why they do not exist on any oceanic island but why on the theory of creation they should not have been created there it would be very difficult to explain mammals offer another and similar case i have carefully searched the oldest voyages but have not finished my search as yet i have not found a single 394 instance free from doubt of a terrestrial mammal excluding domesticated animals kept by the natives inhabiting an island situated above 300 miles from a continent or great continental island and many islands situated at a much less distance are equally barren the falkland islands which are inhabited by a wolf like fox come nearest to an exception but this group cannot be considered as oceanic as it lies on a bank connected with the mainland moreover icebergs formerly brought boulders to its western shores and they may have formerly transported foxes as so frequently now happens in the arctic regions yet it cannot be said that small islands will not support small mammals for they occur in many parts of the world on very small islands if close to a continent and hardly an island can be named on which our smaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised and greatly multiplied it cannot be said on the ordinary view of creation that there has not been time for the creation of mammals many volcanic islands are sufficiently ancient as shown by the stupendous degradation which they have suffered and by their tertiary strata there has also been time for the production of endemic species belonging to other classes and on continents it is thought that mammals appear and disappear at a quicker rate than other and lower animals though terrestrial mammals do not occur on oceanic islands aг rial mammals do occur on almost every island new zealand possesses two bats found nowhere else in the world norfolk island the viti archipelago the bonin islands the caroline and marianne archipelagoes and mauritius all possess their peculiar bats why it may be asked has the supposed creative force produced bats and no other mammals on remote islands on my view this question can easily be answered for no 395 terrestrial mammal can be transported across a wide space of sea but bats can fly across bats have been seen wandering by day far over the atlantic ocean and two north american species either regularly or occasionally visit bermuda at the distance of 600 miles from the mainland i hear from mr tomes who has specially studied this family that many of the same species have enormous ranges and are found on continents and on far distant islands hence we have only to suppose that such wandering species have been modified through natural selection in their new homes in relation to their new position and we can understand the presence of endemic bats on islands with the absence of all terrestrial mammals besides the absence of terrestrial mammals in relation to the remoteness of islands from continents there is also a relation to a certain extent independent of distance between the depth of the sea separating an island from the neighbouring mainland and the presence in both of the same mammiferous species or of allied species in a more or less modified condition mr windsor earl has made some striking observations on this head in regard to the great malay archipelago which is traversed near celebes by a space of deep ocean and this space separates two widely distinct mammalian faunas on either side the islands are situated on moderately deep submarine banks and they are inhabited by closely allied or identical quadrupeds no doubt some few anomalies occur in this great archipelago and there is much difficulty in forming a judgment in some cases owing to the probable naturalisation of certain mammals through man s agency but we shall soon have much light thrown on the natural history of this archipelago by the admirable zeal and researches of mr wallace i have not as yet had time to 396 follow up this subject in all other quarters of the world but as far as i have gone the relation generally holds good we see britain separated by a shallow channel from europe and the mammals are the same on both sides we meet with analogous facts on many islands separated by similar channels from australia the west indian islands stand on a deeply submerged bank nearly 1000 fathoms in depth and here we find american forms but the species and even the genera are distinct as the amount of modification in all cases depends to a certain degree on the lapse of time and as during changes of level it is obvious that islands separated by shallow channels are more likely to have been continuously united within a recent period to the mainland than islands separated by deeper channels we can understand the frequent relation between the depth of the sea and the degree of affinity of the mammalian inhabitants of islands with those of a neighbouring continent an inexplicable relation on the view of independent acts of creation all the foregoing remarks on the inhabitants of oceanic islands namely the scarcity of kinds the richness in endemic forms in particular classes or sections of classes the absence of whole groups as of batrachians and of terrestrial mammals notwithstanding the presence of aг rial bats the singular proportions of certain orders of plants herbaceous forms having been developed into trees c seem to me to accord better with the view of occasional means of transport having been largely efficient in the long course of time than with the view of all our oceanic islands having been formerly connected by continuous land with the nearest continent for on this latter view the migration would probably have been more complete and if modification be admitted all the forms of life would have been more 397 equally modified in accordance with the paramount importance of the relation of organism to organism i do not deny that there are many and grave difficulties in understanding how several of the inhabitants of the more remote islands whether still retaining the same specific form or modified since their arrival could have reached their present homes but the probability of many islands having existed as halting places of which not a wreck now remains must not be overlooked i will here give a single instance of one of the cases of difficulty almost all oceanic islands even the most isolated and smallest are inhabited by land shells generally by endemic species but sometimes by species found elsewhere dr aug a gould has given several interesting cases in regard to the land shells of the islands of the pacific now it is notorious that land shells are very easily killed by salt their eggs at least such as i have tried sink in sea water and are killed by it yet there must be on my view some unknown but highly efficient means for their transportal would the just hatched young occasionally crawl on and adhere to the feet of birds roosting on the ground and thus get transported it occurred to me that land shells when hybernating and having a membranous diaphragm over the mouth of the shell might be floated in chinks of drifted timber across moderately wide arms of the sea and i found that several species did in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in sea water during seven days one of these shells was the helix pomatia and after it had again hybernated i put it in sea water for twenty days and it perfectly recovered as this species has a thick calcareous operculum i removed it and when it had formed a new membranous one i immersed it for fourteen days in sea water and it recovered and crawled away but more experiments are wanted on this head 398 the most striking and important fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of islands is their affinity to those of the nearest mainland without being actually the same species numerous instances could be given of this fact i will give only one that of the galapagos archipelago situated under the equator between 500 and 600 miles from the shores of south america here almost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakeable stamp of the american continent there are twenty six land birds and twenty five of these are ranked by mr gould as distinct species supposed to have been created here yet the close affinity of most of these birds to american species in every character in their habits gestures and tones of voice was manifest so it is with the other animals and with nearly all the plants as shown by dr hooker in his admirable memoir on the flora of this archipelago the naturalist looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the pacific distant several hundred miles from the continent yet feels that he is standing on american land why should this be so why should the species which are supposed to have been created in the galapagos archipelago and nowhere else bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those created in america there is nothing in the conditions of life in the geological nature of the islands in their height or climate or in the proportions in which the several classes are associated together which resembles closely the conditions of the south american coast in fact there is a considerable dissimilarity in all these respects on the other hand there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic nature of the soil in climate height and size of the islands between the galapagos and cape de verde archipelagos but what an entire and absolute difference in their inhabitants the inhabitants of the cape de verde islands are related to 399 those of africa like those of the galapagos to america i believe this grand fact can receive no sort of explanation on the ordinary view of independent creation whereas on the view here maintained it is obvious that the galapagos islands would be likely to receive colonists whether by occasional means of transport or by formerly continuous land from america and the cape de verde islands from africa and that such colonists would be liable to modification the principle of inheritance still betraying their original birthplace many analogous facts could be given indeed it is an almost universal rule that the endemic productions of islands are related to those of the nearest continent or of other near islands the exceptions are few and most of them can be explained thus the plants of kerguelen land though standing nearer to africa than to america are related and that very closely as we know from dr hooker s account to those of america but on the view that this island has been mainly stocked by seeds brought with earth and stones on icebergs drifted by the prevailing currents this anomaly disappears new zealand in its endemic plants is much more closely related to australia the nearest mainland than to any other region and this is what might have been expected but it is also plainly related to south america which although the next nearest continent is so enormously remote that the fact becomes an anomaly but this difficulty almost disappears on the view that both new zealand south america and other southern lands were long ago partially stocked from a nearly intermediate though distant point namely from the antarctic islands when they were clothed with vegetation before the commencement of the glacial period the affinity which though feeble i am assured by dr hooker is real between the flora of the south western corner of australia and of the cape of good 400 hope is a far more remarkable case and is at present inexplicable but this affinity is confined to the plants and will i do not doubt be some day explained the law which causes the inhabitants of an archipelago though specifically distinct to be closely allied to those of the nearest continent we sometimes see displayed on a small scale yet in a most interesting manner within the limits of the same archipelago thus the several islands of the galapagos archipelago are tenanted as i have elsewhere shown in a quite marvellous manner by very closely related species so that the inhabitants of each separate island though mostly distinct are related in an incomparably closer degree to each other than to the inhabitants of any other part of the world and this is just what might have been expected on my view for the islands are situated so near each other that they would almost certainly receive immigrants from the same original source or from each other but this dissimilarity between the endemic inhabitants of the islands may be used as an argument against my views for it may be asked how has it happened in the several islands situated within sight of each other having the same geological nature the same height climate c that many of the immigrants should have been differently modified though only in a small degree this long appeared to me a great difficulty but it arises in chief part from the deeply seated error of considering the physical conditions of a country as the most important for its inhabitants whereas it cannot i think be disputed that the nature of the other inhabitants with which each has to compete is as least as important and generally a far more important element of success now if we look to those inhabitants of the galapagos archipelago which are found in other parts of the world laying on one side for the moment the 401 endemic species which cannot be here fairly included as we are considering how they have come to be modified since their arrival we find a considerable amount of difference in the several islands this difference might indeed have been expected on the view of the islands having been stocked by occasional means of transport a seed for instance of one plant having been brought to one island and that of another plant to another island hence when in former times an immigrant settled on any one or more of the islands or when it subsequently spread from one island to another it would undoubtedly be exposed to different conditions of life in the different islands for it would have to compete with different sets of organisms a plant for instance would find the best fitted ground more perfectly occupied by distinct plants in one island than in another and it would be exposed to the attacks of somewhat different enemies if then it varied natural selection would probably favour different varieties in the different islands some species however might spread and yet retain the same character throughout the group just as we see on continents some species spreading widely and remaining the same the really surprising fact in this case of the galapagos archipelago and in a lesser degree in some analogous instances is that the new species formed in the separate islands have not quickly spread to the other islands but the islands though in sight of each other are separated by deep arms of the sea in most cases wider than the british channel and there is no reason to suppose that they have at any former period been continuously united the currents of the sea are rapid and sweep across the archipelago and gales of wind are extraordinarily rare so that the islands are far more effectually separated from each other than they appear to be on a map nevertheless a good many 402 species both those found in other parts of the world and those confined to the archipelago are common to the several islands and we may infer from certain facts that these have probably spread from some one island to the others but we often take i think an erroneous view of the probability of closely allied species invading each other s territory when put into free intercommunication undoubtedly if one species has any advantage whatever over another it will in a very brief time wholly or in part supplant it but if both are equally well fitted for their own places in nature both probably will hold their own places and keep separate for almost any length of time being familiar with the fact that many species naturalised through man s agency have spread with astonishing rapidity over new countries we are apt to infer that most species would thus spread but we should remember that the forms which become naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied to the aboriginal inhabitants but are very distinct species belonging in a large proportion of cases as shown by alph de candolle to distinct genera in the galapagos archipelago many even of the birds though so well adapted for flying from island to island are distinct on each thus there are three closely allied species of mocking thrush each confined to its own island now let us suppose the mocking thrush of chatham island to be blown to charles island which has its own mocking thrush why should it succeed in establishing itself there we may safely infer that charles island is well stocked with its own species for annually more eggs are laid there than can possibly be reared and we may infer that the mocking thrush peculiar to charles island is at least as well fitted for its home as is the species peculiar to chatham island sir c lyell and mr wollaston have communicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this 403 subject namely that madeira and the adjoining islet of porto santo possess many distinct but representative land shells some of which live in crevices of stone and although large quantities of stone are annually transported from porto santo to madeira yet this latter island has not become colonised by the porto santo species nevertheless both islands have been colonised by some european land shells which no doubt had some advantage over the indigenous species from these considerations i think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic and representative species which inhabit the several islands of the galapagos archipelago not having universally spread from island to island in many other instances as in the several districts of the same continent pre occupation has probably played an important part in checking the commingling of species under the same conditions of life thus the south east and south west corners of australia have nearly the same physical conditions and are united by continuous land yet they are inhabited by a vast number of distinct mammals birds and plants the principle which determines the general character of the fauna and flora of oceanic islands namely that the inhabitants when not identically the same yet are plainly related to the inhabitants of that region whence colonists could most readily have been derived the colonists having been subsequently modified and better fitted to their new homes is of the widest application throughout nature we see this on every mountain in every lake and marsh for alpine species excepting in so far as the same forms chiefly of plants have spread widely throughout the world during the recent glacial epoch are related to those of the surrounding lowlands thus we have in south america alpine humming birds alpine rodents alpine plants 404 c all of strictly american forms and it is obvious that a mountain as it became slowly upheaved would naturally be colonised from the surrounding lowlands so it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes excepting in so far as great facility of transport has given the same general forms to the whole world we see this same principle in the blind animals inhabiting the caves of america and of europe other analogous facts could be given and it will i believe be universally found to be true that wherever in two regions let them be ever so distant many closely allied or representative species occur there will likewise be found some identical species showing in accordance with the foregoing view that at some former period there has been intercommunication or migration between the two regions and wherever many closely allied species occur there will be found many forms which some naturalists rank as distinct species and some as varieties these doubtful forms showing us the steps in the process of modification this relation between the power and extent of migration of a species either at the present time or at some former period under different physical conditions and the existence at remote points of the world of other species allied to it is shown in another and more general way mr gould remarked to me long ago that in those genera of birds which range over the world many of the species have very wide ranges i can hardly doubt that this rule is generally true though it would be difficult to prove it amongst mammals we see it strikingly displayed in bats and in a lesser degree in the felidг and canidг we see it if we compare the distribution of butterflies and beetles so it is with most fresh water productions in which so many genera range over the world and many individual species have 405 enormous ranges it is not meant that in world ranging genera all the species have a wide range or even that they have on an average a wide range but only that some of the species range very widely for the facility with which widely ranging species vary and give rise to new forms will largely determine their average range for instance two varieties of the same species inhabit america and europe and the species thus has an immense range but if the variation had been a little greater the two varieties would have been ranked as distinct species and the common range would have been greatly reduced still less is it meant that a species which apparently has the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging widely as in the case of certain powerfully winged birds will necessarily range widely for we should never forget that to range widely implies not only the power of crossing barriers but the more important power of being victorious in distant lands in the struggle for life with foreign associates but on the view of all the species of a genus having descended from a single parent though now distributed to the most remote points of the world we ought to find and i believe as a general rule we do find that some at least of the species range very widely for it is necessary that the unmodified parent should range widely undergoing modification during its diffusion and should place itself under diverse conditions favourable for the conversion of its offspring firstly into new varieties and ultimately into new species in considering the wide distribution of certain genera we should bear in mind that some are extremely ancient and must have branched off from a common parent at a remote epoch so that in such cases there will have been ample time for great climatal and geographical changes and for accidents of transport and consequently for the migration of some of the species into all 406 quarters of the world where they may have become slightly modified in relation to their new conditions there is also some reason to believe from geological evidence that organisms low in the scale within each great class generally change at a slower rate than the higher forms and consequently the lower forms will have had a better chance of ranging widely and of still retaining the same specific character this fact together with the seeds and eggs of many low forms being very minute and better fitted for distant transportation probably accounts for a law which has long been observed and which has lately been admirably discussed by alph de candolle in regard to plants namely that the lower any group of organisms is the more widely it is apt to range the relations just discussed namely low and slowly changing organisms ranging more widely than the high some of the species of widely ranging genera themselves ranging widely such facts as alpine lacustrine and marsh productions being related with the exceptions before specified to those on the surrounding low lands and dry lands though these stations are so different the very close relation of the distinct species which inhabit the islets of the same archipelago and especially the striking relation of the inhabitants of each whole archipelago or island to those of the nearest mainland are i think utterly inexplicable on the ordinary view of the independent creation of each species but are explicable on the view of colonisation from the nearest or readiest source together with the subsequent modification and better adaptation of the colonists to their new homes summary of last and present chapters in these chapters i have endeavoured to show that if we make due allowance for our ignorance of the full effects of all 407 the changes of climate and of the level of the land which have certainly occurred within the recent period and of other similar changes which may have occurred within the same period if we remember how profoundly ignorant we are with respect to the many and curious means of occasional transport a subject which has hardly ever been properly experimentised on if we bear in mind how often a species may have ranged continuously over a wide area and then have become extinct in the intermediate tracts i think the difficulties in believing that all the individuals of the same species wherever located have descended from the same parents are not insuperable and we are led to this conclusion which has been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of single centres of creation by some general considerations more especially from the importance of barriers and from the analogical distribution of sub genera genera and families with respect to the distinct species of the same genus which on my theory must have spread from one parent source if we make the same allowances as before for our ignorance and remember that some forms of life change most slowly enormous periods of time being thus granted for their migration i do not think that the difficulties are insuperable though they often are in this case and in that of the individuals of the same species extremely great as exemplifying the effects of climatal changes on distribution i have attempted to show how important has been the influence of the modern glacial period which i am fully convinced simultaneously affected the whole world or at least great meridional belts as showing how diversified are the means of occasional transport i have discussed at some little length the means of dispersal of fresh water productions 408 if the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the long course of time the individuals of the same species and likewise of allied species have proceeded from some one source then i think all the grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable on the theory of migration generally of the more dominant forms of life together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of new forms we can thus understand the high importance of barriers whether of land or water which separate our several zoological and botanical provinces we can thus understand the localisation of sub genera genera and families and how it is that under different latitudes for instance in south america the inhabitants of the plains and mountains of the forests marshes and deserts are in so mysterious a manner linked together by affinity and are likewise linked to the extinct beings which formerly inhabited the same continent bearing in mind that the mutual relation of organism to organism is of the highest importance we can see why two areas having nearly the same physical conditions should often be inhabited by very different forms of life for according to the length of time which has elapsed since new inhabitants entered one region according to the nature of the communication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter either in greater or lesser numbers according or not as those which entered happened to come in more or less direct competition with each other and with the aborigines and according as the immigrants were capable of varying more or less rapidly there would ensue in different regions independently of their physical conditions infinitely diversified conditions of life there would be an almost endless amount of organic action and reaction and we should find as we do find some groups of beings greatly and some only slightly modified some 409 developed in great force some existing in scanty numbers in the different great geographical provinces of the world on these same principles we can understand as i have endeavoured to show why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants but of these a great number should be endemic or peculiar and why in relation to the means of migration one group of beings even within the same class should have all its species endemic and another group should have all its species common to other quarters of the world we can see why whole groups of organisms as batrachians and terrestrial mammals should be absent from oceanic islands whilst the most isolated islands possess their own peculiar species of aг rial mammals or bats we can see why there should be some relation between the presence of mammals in a more or less modified condition and the depth of the sea between an island and the mainland we can clearly see why all the inhabitants of an archipelago though specifically distinct on the several islets should be closely related to each other and likewise be related but less closely to those of the nearest continent or other source whence immigrants were probably derived we can see why in two areas however distant from each other there should be a correlation in the presence of identical species of varieties of doubtful species and of distinct but representative species as the late edward forbes often insisted there is a striking parallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space the laws governing the succession of forms in past times being nearly the same with those governing at the present time the differences in different areas we see this in many facts the endurance of each species and group of species is continuous in time for the exceptions to the rule are so few that they may 410 fairly be attributed to our not having as yet discovered in an intermediate deposit the forms which are therein absent but which occur above and below so in space it certainly is the general rule that the area inhabited by a single species or by a group of species is continuous and the exceptions which are not rare may as i have attempted to show be accounted for by migration at some former period under different conditions or by occasional means of transport and by the species having become extinct in the intermediate tracts both in time and space species and groups of species have their points of maximum development groups of species belonging either to a certain period of time or to a certain area are often characterised by trifling characters in common as of sculpture or colour in looking to the long succession of ages as in now looking to distant provinces throughout the world we find that some organisms differ little whilst others belonging to a different class or to a different order or even only to a different family of the same order differ greatly in both time and space the lower members of each class generally change less than the higher but there are in both cases marked exceptions to the rule on my theory these several relations throughout time and space are intelligible for whether we look to the forms of life which have changed during successive ages within the same quarter of the world or to those which have changed after having migrated into distant quarters in both cases the forms within each class have been connected by the same bond of ordinary generation and the more nearly any two forms are related in blood the nearer they will generally stand to each other in time and space in both cases the laws of variation have been the same and

embryology laws of explained by variations not supervening at an early age and being inherited at a corresponding age rudimentary organs their origin explained summary from the first dawn of life all organic beings are found to resemble each other in descending degrees so that they can be classed in groups under groups this classification is evidently not arbitrary like the grouping of the stars in constellations the existence of groups would have been of simple signification if one group had been exclusively fitted to inhabit the land and another the water one to feed on flesh another on vegetable matter and so on but the case is widely different in nature for it is notorious how commonly members of even the same sub group have different habits in our second and fourth chapters on variation and on natural selection i have attempted to show that it is the widely ranging the much diffused and common that is the dominant species belonging to the larger genera which vary most the varieties or incipient species thus produced ultimately become converted as i believe into new and distinct species and these on the principle of inheritance tend to produce other new and dominant 412 species consequently the groups which are now large and which generally include many dominant species tend to go on increasing indefinitely in size i further attempted to show that from the varying descendants of each species trying to occupy as many and as different places as possible in the economy of nature there is a constant tendency in their characters to diverge this conclusion was supported by looking at the great diversity of the forms of life which in any small area come into the closest competition and by looking to certain facts in naturalisation i attempted also to show that there is a constant tendency in the forms which are increasing in number and diverging in character to supplant and exterminate the less divergent the less improved and preceding forms i request the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating the action as formerly explained of these several principles and he will see that the inevitable result is that the modified descendants proceeding from one progenitor become broken up into groups subordinate to groups in the diagram each letter on the uppermost line may represent a genus including several species and all the genera on this line form together one class for all have descended from one ancient but unseen parent and consequently have inherited something in common but the three genera on the left hand have on this same principle much in common and form a sub family distinct from that including the next two genera on the right hand which diverged from a common parent at the fifth stage of descent these five genera have also much though less in common and they form a family distinct from that including the three genera still further to the right hand which diverged at a still earlier period and all these genera descended from a form an order distinct from the 413 genera descended from i so that we here have many species descended from a single progenitor grouped into genera and the genera are included in or subordinate to sub families families and orders all united into one class thus the grand fact in natural history of the subordination of group under group which from its familiarity does not always sufficiently strike us is in my judgment explained naturalists try to arrange the species genera and families in each class on what is called the natural system but what is meant by this system some authors look at it merely as a scheme for arranging together those living objects which are most alike and for separating those which are most unlike or as an artificial means for enunciating as briefly as possible general propositions that is by one sentence to give the characters common for instance to all mammals by another those common to all carnivora by another those common to the dog genus and then by adding a single sentence a full description is given of each kind of dog the ingenuity and utility of this system are indisputable but many naturalists think that something more is meant by the natural system they believe that it reveals the plan of the creator but unless it be specified whether order in time or space or what else is meant by the plan of the creator it seems to me that nothing is thus added to our knowledge such expressions as that famous one of linnг us and which we often meet with in a more or less concealed form that the characters do not make the genus but that the genus gives the characters seem to imply that something more is included in our classification than mere resemblance i believe that something more is included and that propinquity of descent the only known cause of the similarity of organic beings is the bond hidden as it is by various degrees of 414 modification which is partially revealed to us by our classifications let us now consider the rules followed in classification and the difficulties which are encountered on the view that classification either gives some unknown plan of creation or is simply a scheme for enunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms most like each other it might have been thought and was in ancient times thought that those parts of the structure which determined the habits of life and the general place of each being in the economy of nature would be of very high importance in classification nothing can be more false no one regards the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew of a dugong to a whale of a whale to a fish as of any importance these resemblances though so intimately connected with the whole life of the being are ranked as merely adaptive or analogical characters but to the consideration of these resemblances we shall have to recur it may even be given as a general rule that the less any part of the organisation is concerned with special habits the more important it becomes for classification as an instance owen in speaking of the dugong says the generative organs being those which are most remotely related to the habits and food of an animal i have always regarded as affording very clear indications of its true affinities we are least likely in the modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptive for an essential character so with plants how remarkable it is that the organs of vegetation on which their whole life depends are of little signification excepting in the first main divisions whereas the organs of reproduction with their product the seed are of paramount importance we must not therefore in classifying trust to resemblances in parts of the organisation however important 415 they may be for the welfare of the being in relation to the outer world perhaps from this cause it has partly arisen that almost all naturalists lay the greatest stress on resemblances in organs of high vital or physiological importance no doubt this view of the classificatory importance of organs which are important is generally but by no means always true but their importance for classification i believe depends on their greater constancy throughout large groups of species and this constancy depends on such organs having generally been subjected to less change in the adaptation of the species to their conditions of life that the mere physiological importance of an organ does not determine its classificatory value is almost shown by the one fact that in allied groups in which the same organ as we have every reason to suppose has nearly the same physiological value its classificatory value is widely different no naturalist can have worked at any group without being struck with this fact and it has been fully acknowledged in the writings of almost every author it will suffice to quote the highest authority robert brown who in speaking of certain organs in the proteaceг says their generic importance like that of all their parts not only in this but as i apprehend in every natural family is very unequal and in some cases seems to be entirely lost again in another work he says the genera of the connaraceг differ in having one or more ovaria in the existence or absence of albumen in the imbricate or valvular г stivation any one of these characters singly is frequently of more than generic importance though here even when all taken together they appear insufficient to separate cnestis from connarus to give an example amongst insects in one great division of the hymenoptera the antennг as westwood has remarked are most constant in structure 416 in another division they differ much and the differences are of quite subordinate value in classification yet no one probably will say that the antennae in these two divisions of the same order are of unequal physiological importance any number of instances could be given of the varying importance for classification of the same important organ within the same group of beings again no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of high physiological or vital importance yet undoubtedly organs in this condition are often of high value in classification no one will dispute that the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants and certain rudimentary bones of the leg are highly serviceable in exhibiting the close affinity between ruminants and pachyderms robert brown has strongly insisted on the fact that the rudimentary florets are of the highest importance in the classification of the grasses numerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts which must be considered of very trifling physiological importance but which are universally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition of whole groups for instance whether or not there is an open passage from the nostrils to the mouth the only character according to owen which absolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles the inflection of the angle of the jaws in marsupials the manner in which the wings of insects are folded mere colour in certain algг mere pubescence on parts of the flower in grasses the nature of the dermal covering as hair or feathers in the vertebrata if the ornithorhynchus had been covered with feathers instead of hair this external and trifling character would i think have been considered by naturalists as important an aid in determining the degree of affinity of this strange creature to 417 birds and reptiles as an approach in structure in any one internal and important organ the importance for classification of trifling characters mainly depends on their being correlated with several other characters of more or less importance the value indeed of an aggregate of characters is very evident in natural history hence as has often been remarked a species may depart from its allies in several characters both of high physiological importance and of almost universal prevalence and yet leave us in no doubt where it should be ranked hence also it has been found that a classification founded on any single character however important that may be has always failed for no part of the organisation is universally constant the importance of an aggregate of characters even when none are important alone explains i think that saying of linnг us that the characters do not give the genus but the genus gives the characters for this saying seems founded on an appreciation of many trifling points of resemblance too slight to be defined certain plants belonging to the malpighiaceг bear perfect and degraded flowers in the latter as a de jussieu has remarked the greater number of the characters proper to the species to the genus to the family to the class disappear and thus laugh at our classification but when aspicarpa produced in france during several years only degraded flowers departing so wonderfully in a number of the most important points of structure from the proper type of the order yet m richard sagaciously saw as jussieu observes that this genus should still be retained amongst the malpighiaceг this case seems to me well to illustrate the spirit with which our classifications are sometimes necessarily founded practically when naturalists are at work they do 418 not trouble themselves about the physiological value of the characters which they use in defining a group or in allocating any particular species if they find a character nearly uniform and common to a great number of forms and not common to others they use it as one of high value if common to some lesser number they use it as of subordinate value this principle has been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one and by none more clearly than by that excellent botanist aug st hilaire if certain characters are always found correlated with others though no apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them especial value is set on them as in most groups of animals important organs such as those for propelling the blood or for aг rating it or those for propagating the race are found nearly uniform they are considered as highly serviceable in classification but in some groups of animals all these the most important vital organs are found to offer characters of quite subordinate value we can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal importance with those derived from the adult for our classifications of course include all ages of each species but it is by no means obvious on the ordinary view why the structure of the embryo should be more important for this purpose than that of the adult which alone plays its full part in the economy of nature yet it has been strongly urged by those great naturalists milne edwards and agassiz that embryonic characters are the most important of any in the classification of animals and this doctrine has very generally been admitted as true the same fact holds good with flowering plants of which the two main divisions have been founded on characters derived from the embryo on the number and position of the 419 embryonic leaves or cotyledons and on the mode of development of the plumule and radicle in our discussion on embryology we shall see why such characters are so valuable on the view of classification tacitly including the idea of descent our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains of affinities nothing can be easier than to define a number of characters common to all birds but in the case of crustaceans such definition has hitherto been found impossible there are crustaceans at the opposite ends of the series which have hardly a character in common yet the species at both ends from being plainly allied to others and these to others and so onwards can be recognised as unequivocally belonging to this and to no other class of the articulata geographical distribution has often been used though perhaps not quite logically in classification more especially in very large groups of closely allied forms temminck insists on the utility or even necessity of this practice in certain groups of birds and it has been followed by several entomologists and botanists finally with respect to the comparative value of the various groups of species such as orders sub orders families sub families and genera they seem to be at least at present almost arbitrary several of the best botanists such as mr bentham and others have strongly insisted on their arbitrary value instances could be given amongst plants and insects of a group of forms first ranked by practised naturalists as only a genus and then raised to the rank of a sub family or family and this has been done not because further research has detected important structural differences at first overlooked but because numerous allied species with slightly different grades of difference have been subsequently discovered 420 all the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained if i do not greatly deceive myself on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species are those which have been inherited from a common parent and in so far all true classification is genealogical that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking and not some unknown plan of creation or the enunciation of general propositions and the mere putting together and separating objects more or less alike but i must explain my meaning more fully i believe that the arrangement of the groups within each class in due subordination and relation to the other groups must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor may differ greatly being due to the different degrees of modification which they have undergone and this is expressed by the forms being ranked under different genera families sections or orders the reader will best understand what is meant if he will take the trouble of referring to the diagram in the fourth chapter we will suppose the letters a to l to represent allied genera which lived during the silurian epoch and these have descended from a species which existed at an unknown anterior period species of three of these genera a f and i have transmitted modified descendants to the present day represented by the fifteen genera a 14 to z 14 on the uppermost horizontal line now all these modified descendants from a single species are represented as related in blood or descent to the same 421 degree they may metaphorically be called cousins to the same millionth degree yet they differ widely and in different degrees from each other the forms descended from a now broken up into two or three families constitute a distinct order from those descended from i also broken up into two families nor can the existing species descended from a be ranked in the same genus with the parent a or those from i with the parent i but the existing genus f 14 may be supposed to have been but slightly modified and it will then rank with the parent genus f just as some few still living organic beings belong to silurian genera so that the amount or value of the differences between organic beings all related to each other in the same degree in blood has come to be widely different nevertheless their genealogical arrangement remains strictly true not only at the present time but at each successive period of descent all the modified descendants from a will have inherited something in common from their common parent as will all the descendants from i so will it be with each subordinate branch of descendants at each successive period if however we choose to suppose that any of the descendants of a or of i have been so much modified as to have more or less completely lost traces of their parentage in this case their places in a natural classification will have been more or less completely lost as sometimes seems to have occurred with existing organisms all the descendants of the genus f along its whole line of descent are supposed to have been but little modified and they yet form a single genus but this genus though much isolated will still occupy its proper intermediate position for f originally was intermediate in character between a and i and the several genera descended from these two genera will 422 have inherited to a certain extent their characters this natural arrangement is shown as far as is possible on paper in the diagram but in much too simple a manner if a branching diagram had not been used and only the names of the groups had been written in a linear series it would have been still less possible to have given a natural arrangement and it is notoriously not possible to represent in a series on a flat surface the affinities which we discover in nature amongst the beings of the same group thus on the view which i hold the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement like a pedigree but the degrees of modification which the different groups have undergone have to be expressed by ranking them under different so called genera sub families families sections orders and classes it may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification by taking the case of languages if we possessed a perfect pedigree of mankind a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford the best classification of the various languages now spoken throughout the world and if all extinct languages and all intermediate and slowly changing dialects had to be included such an arrangement would i think be the only possible one yet it might be that some very ancient language had altered little and had given rise to few new languages whilst others owing to the spreading and subsequent isolation and states of civilisation of the several races descended from a common race had altered much and had given rise to many new languages and dialects the various degrees of difference in the languages from the same stock would have to be expressed by groups subordinate to groups but the proper or even only possible arrangement would still be genealogical and this would be strictly natural as 423 it would connect together all languages extinct and modern by the closest affinities and would give the filiation and origin of each tongue in confirmation of this view let us glance at the classification of varieties which are believed or known to have descended from one species these are grouped under species with sub varieties under varieties and with our domestic productions several other grades of difference are requisite as we have seen with pigeons the origin of the existence of groups subordinate to groups is the same with varieties as with species namely closeness of descent with various degrees of modification nearly the same rules are followed in classifying varieties as with species authors have insisted on the necessity of classing varieties on a natural instead of an artificial system we are cautioned for instance not to class two varieties of the pine apple together merely because their fruit though the most important part happens to be nearly identical no one puts the swedish and common turnips together though the esculent and thickened stems are so similar whatever part is found to be most constant is used in classing varieties thus the great agriculturist marshall says the horns are very useful for this purpose with cattle because they are less variable than the shape or colour of the body c whereas with sheep the horns are much less serviceable because less constant in classing varieties i apprehend if we had a real pedigree a genealogical classification would be universally preferred and it has been attempted by some authors for we might feel sure whether there had been more or less modification the principle of inheritance would keep the forms together which were allied in the greatest number of points in tumbler pigeons though some sub varieties differ from the others 424 in the important character of having a longer beak yet all are kept together from having the common habit of tumbling but the short faced breed has nearly or quite lost this habit nevertheless without any reasoning or thinking on the subject these tumblers are kept in the same group because allied in blood and alike in some other respects if it could be proved that the hottentot had descended from the negro i think he would be classed under the negro group however much he might differ in colour and other important characters from negroes with species in a state of nature every naturalist has in fact brought descent into his classification for he includes in his lowest grade or that of a species the two sexes and how enormously these sometimes differ in the most important characters is known to every naturalist scarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the males and hermaphrodites of certain cirripedes when adult and yet no one dreams of separating them the naturalist includes as one species the several larval stages of the same individual however much they may differ from each other and from the adult as he likewise includes the so called alternate generations of steenstrup which can only in a technical sense be considered as the same individual he includes monsters he includes varieties not solely because they closely resemble the parent form but because they are descended from it he who believes that the cowslip is descended from the primrose or conversely ranks them together as a single species and gives a single definition as soon as three orchidean forms monochanthus myanthus and catasetum which had previously been ranked as three distinct genera were known to be sometimes produced on the same spike they were immediately included as a single species 425 as descent has universally been used in classing together the individuals of the same species though the males and females and larvг are sometimes extremely different and as it has been used in classing varieties which have undergone a certain and sometimes a considerable amount of modification may not this same element of descent have been unconsciously used in grouping species under genera and genera under higher groups though in these cases the modification has been greater in degree and has taken a longer time to complete i believe it has thus been unconsciously used and only thus can i understand the several rules and guides which have been followed by our best systematists we have no written pedigrees we have to make out community of descent by resemblances of any kind therefore we choose those characters which as far as we can judge are the least likely to have been modified in relation to the conditions of life to which each species has been recently exposed rudimentary structures on this view are as good as or even sometimes better than other parts of the organisation we care not how trifling a character may be let it be the mere inflection of the angle of the jaw the manner in which an insect s wing is folded whether the skin be covered by hair or feathers if it prevail throughout many and different species especially those having very different habits of life it assumes high value for we can account for its presence in so many forms with such different habits only by its inheritance from a common parent we may err in this respect in regard to single points of structure but when several characters let them be ever so trifling occur together throughout a large group of beings having different habits we may feel almost sure on the theory of descent that these characters have been inherited from a common ancestor 426 and we know that such correlated or aggregated characters have especial value in classification we can understand why a species or a group of species may depart in several of its most important characteristics from its allies and yet be safely classed with them this may be safely done and is often done as long as a sufficient number of characters let them be ever so unimportant betrays the hidden bond of community of descent let two forms have not a single character in common yet if these extreme forms are connected together by a chain of intermediate groups we may at once infer their community of descent and we put them all into the same class as we find organs of high physiological importance those which serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions of existence are generally the most constant we attach especial value to them but if these same organs in another group or section of a group are found to differ much we at once value them less in our classification we shall hereafter i think clearly see why embryological characters are of such high classificatory importance geographical distribution may sometimes be brought usefully into play in classing large and widely distributed genera because all the species of the same genus inhabiting any distinct and isolated region have in all probability descended from the same parents we can understand on these views the very important distinction between real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances lamarck first called attention to this distinction and he has been ably followed by macleay and others the resemblance in the shape of the body and in the fin like anterior limbs between the dugong which is a pachydermatous animal and the whale and between both these mammals and fishes is analogical amongst insects there are innumerable 427 instances thus linnг us misled by external appearances actually classed an homopterous insect as a moth we see something of the same kind even in our domestic varieties as in the thickened stems of the common and swedish turnip the resemblance of the greyhound and racehorse is hardly more fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authors between very distinct animals on my view of characters being of real importance for classification only in so far as they reveal descent we can clearly understand why analogical or adaptive character although of the utmost importance to the welfare of the being are almost valueless to the systematist for animals belonging to two most distinct lines of descent may readily become adapted to similar conditions and thus assume a close external resemblance but such resemblances will not reveal will rather tend to conceal their blood relationship to their proper lines of descent we can also understand the apparent paradox that the very same characters are analogical when one class or order is compared with another but give true affinities when the members of the same class or order are compared one with another thus the shape of the body and fin like limbs are only analogical when whales are compared with fishes being adaptations in both classes for swimming through the water but the shape of the body and fin like limbs serve as characters exhibiting true affinity between the several members of the whale family for these cetaceans agree in so many characters great and small that we cannot doubt that they have inherited their general shape of body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor so it is with fishes as members of distinct classes have often been adapted by successive slight modifications to live under nearly similar circumstances to inhabit for instance 428 the three elements of land air and water we can perhaps understand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimes been observed between the sub groups in distinct classes a naturalist struck by a parallelism of this nature in any one class by arbitrarily raising or sinking the value of the groups in other classes and all our experience shows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary could easily extend the parallelism over a wide range and thus the septenary quinary quaternary and ternary classifications have probably arisen as the modified descendants of dominant species belonging to the larger genera tend to inherit the advantages which made the groups to which they belong large and their parents dominant they are almost sure to spread widely and to seize on more and more places in the economy of nature the larger and more dominant groups thus tend to go on increasing in size and they consequently supplant many smaller and feebler groups thus we can account for the fact that all organisms recent and extinct are included under a few great orders under still fewer classes and all in one great natural system as showing how few the higher groups are in number and how widely spread they are throughout the world the fact is striking that the discovery of australia has not added a single insect belonging to a new class and that in the vegetable kingdom as i learn from dr hooker it has added only two or three orders of small size in the chapter on geological succession i attempted to show on the principle of each group having generally diverged much in character during the long continued process of modification how it is that the more ancient forms of life often present characters in some slight degree intermediate between existing groups a few 429 old and intermediate parent forms having occasionally transmitted to the present day descendants but little modified will give to us our so called osculant or aberrant groups the more aberrant any form is the greater must be the number of connecting forms which on my theory have been exterminated and utterly lost and we have some evidence of aberrant forms having suffered severely from extinction for they are generally represented by extremely few species and such species as do occur are generally very distinct from each other which again implies extinction the genera ornithorhynchus and lepidosiren for example would not have been less aberrant had each been represented by a dozen species instead of by a single one but such richness in species as i find after some investigation does not commonly fall to the lot of aberrant genera we can i think account for this fact only by looking at aberrant forms as failing groups conquered by more successful competitors with a few members preserved by some unusual coincidence of favourable circumstances mr waterhouse has remarked that when a member belonging to one group of animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group this affinity in most cases is general and not special thus according to mr waterhouse of all rodents the bizcacha is most nearly related to marsupials but in the points in which it approaches this order its relations are general and not to any one marsupial species more than to another as the points of affinity of the bizcacha to marsupials are believed to be real and not merely adaptive they are due on my theory to inheritance in common therefore we must suppose either that all rodents including the bizcacha branched off from some very ancient marsupial which will have had a character in some degree intermediate with respect to all existing marsupials or 430 that both rodents and marsupials branched off from a common progenitor and that both groups have since undergone much modification in divergent directions on either view we may suppose that the bizcacha has retained by inheritance more of the character of its ancient progenitor than have other rodents and therefore it will not be specially related to any one existing marsupial but indirectly to all or nearly all marsupials from having partially retained the character of their common progenitor or of an early member of the group on the other hand of all marsupials as mr waterhouse has remarked the phascolomys resembles most nearly not any one species but the general order of rodents in this case however it may be strongly suspected that the resemblance is only analogical owing to the phascolomys having become adapted to habits like those of a rodent the elder de candolle has made nearly similar observations on the general nature of the affinities of distinct orders of plants on the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence in character of the species descended from a common parent together with their retention by inheritance of some characters in common we can understand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which all the members of the same family or higher group are connected together for the common parent of a whole family of species now broken up by extinction into distinct groups and sub groups will have transmitted some of its characters modified in various ways and degrees to all and the several species will consequently be related to each other by circuitous lines of affinity of various lengths as may be seen in the diagram so often referred to mounting up through many predecessors as it is difficult to show the blood relationship between the numerous kindred 431 of any ancient and noble family even by the aid of a genealogical tree and almost impossible to do this without this aid we can understand the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists have experienced in describing without the aid of a diagram the various affinities which they perceive between the many living and extinct members of the same great natural class extinction as we have seen in the fourth chapter has played an important part in defining and widening the intervals between the several groups in each class we may thus account even for the distinctness of whole classes from each other for instance of birds from all other vertebrate animals by the belief that many ancient forms of life have been utterly lost through which the early progenitors of birds were formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other vertebrate classes there has been less entire extinction of the forms of life which once connected fishes with batrachians there has been still less in some other classes as in that of the crustacea for here the most wonderfully diverse forms are still tied together by a long but broken chain of affinities extinction has only separated groups it has by no means made them for if every form which has ever lived on this earth were suddenly to reappear though it would be quite impossible to give definitions by which each group could be distinguished from other groups as all would blend together by steps as fine as those between the finest existing varieties nevertheless a natural classification or at least a natural arrangement would be possible we shall see this by turning to the diagram the letters a to l may represent eleven silurian genera some of which have produced large groups of modified descendants every intermediate link between these eleven genera and their primordial parent and every 432 intermediate link in each branch and sub branch of their descendants may be supposed to be still alive and the links to be as fine as those between the finest varieties in this case it would be quite impossible to give any definition by which the several members of the several groups could be distinguished from their more immediate parents or these parents from their ancient and unknown progenitor yet the natural arrangement in the diagram would still hold good and on the principle of inheritance all the forms descended from a or from i would have something in common in a tree we can specify this or that branch though at the actual fork the two unite and blend together we could not as i have said define the several groups but we could pick out types or forms representing most of the characters of each group whether large or small and thus give a general idea of the value of the differences between them this is what we should be driven to if we were ever to succeed in collecting all the forms in any class which have lived throughout all time and space we shall certainly never succeed in making so perfect a collection nevertheless in certain classes we are tending in this direction and milne edwards has lately insisted in an able paper on the high importance of looking to types whether or not we can separate and define the groups to which such types belong finally we have seen that natural selection which results from the struggle for existence and which almost inevitably induces extinction and divergence of character in the many descendants from one dominant parent species explains that great and universal feature in the affinities of all organic beings namely their subordination in group under group we use the element of descent in classing the individuals of both sexes and of all ages although having few characters in common 433 under one species we use descent in classing acknowledged varieties however different they may be from their parent and i believe this element of descent is the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have sought under the term of the natural system on this idea of the natural system being in so far as it has been perfected genealogical in its arrangement with the grades of difference between the descendants from a common parent expressed by the terms genera families orders c we can understand the rules which we are compelled to follow in our classification we can understand why we value certain resemblances far more than others why we are permitted to use rudimentary and useless organs or others of trifling physiological importance why in comparing one group with a distinct group we summarily reject analogical or adaptive characters and yet use these same characters within the limits of the same group we can clearly see how it is that all living and extinct forms can be grouped together in one great system and how the several members of each class are connected together by the most complex and radiating lines of affinities we shall never probably disentangle the inextricable web of affinities between the members of any one class but when we have a distinct object in view and do not look to some unknown plan of creation we may hope to make sure but slow progress morphology we have seen that the members of the same class independently of their habits of life resemble each other in the general plan of their organisation this resemblance is often expressed by the term unity of type or by saying that the several parts and organs in the different species of the class are homologous the whole subject is included under 434 the general name of morphology this is the most interesting department of natural history and may be said to be its very soul what can be more curious than that the hand of a man formed for grasping that of a mole for digging the leg of the horse the paddle of the porpoise and the wing of the bat should all be constructed on the same pattern and should include similar bones in the same relative positions geoffroy st hilaire has insisted strongly on the high importance of relative connexion in homologous organs the parts may change to almost any extent in form and size and yet they always remain connected together in the same order we never find for instance the bones of the arm and forearm or of the thigh and leg transposed hence the same names can be given to the homologous bones in widely different animals we see the same great law in the construction of the mouths of insects what can be more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of a sphinx moth the curious folded one of a bee or bug and the great jaws of a beetle yet all these organs serving for such different purposes are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip mandibles and two pairs of maxillг analogous laws govern the construction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans so it is with the flowers of plants nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarity of pattern in members of the same class by utility or by the doctrine of final causes the hopelessness of the attempt has been expressly admitted by owen in his most interesting work on the nature of limbs on the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being we can only say that so it is that it has so pleased the creator to construct each animal and plant the explanation is manifest on the theory of the 435 natural selection of successive slight modifications each modification being profitable in some way to the modified form but often affecting by correlation of growth other parts of the organisation in changes of this nature there will be little or no tendency to modify the original pattern or to transpose parts the bones of a limb might be shortened and widened to any extent and become gradually enveloped in thick membrane so as to serve as a fin or a webbed foot might have all its bones or certain bones lengthened to any extent and the membrane connecting them increased to any extent so as to serve as a wing yet in all this great amount of modification there will be no tendency to alter the framework of bones or the relative connexion of the several parts if we suppose that the ancient progenitor the archetype as it may be called of all mammals had its limbs constructed on the existing general pattern for whatever purpose they served we can at once perceive the plain signification of the homologous construction of the limbs throughout the whole class so with the mouths of insects we have only to suppose that their common progenitor had an upper lip mandibles and two pair of maxillг these parts being perhaps very simple in form and then natural selection acting on some originally created form will account for the infinite diversity in structure and function of the mouths of insects nevertheless it is conceivable that the general pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to be finally lost by the atrophy and ultimately by the complete abortion of certain parts by the soldering together of other parts and by the doubling or multiplication of others variations which we know to be within the limits of possibility in the paddles of the extinct gigantic sea lizards and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans the 436 general pattern seems to have been thus to a certain extent obscured there is another and equally curious branch of the present subject namely the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class but of the different parts or organs in the same individual most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrг the anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous we see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans it is familiar to almost every one that in a flower the relative position of the sepals petals stamens and pistils as well as their intimate structure are intelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves arranged in a spire in monstrous plants we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals and in flowers that organs which when mature become extremely different are at an early stage of growth exactly alike how inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinary shaped pieces of bone as owen has remarked the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat used as they are for such totally different purposes why should one crustacean which has an extremely complex 437 mouth formed of many parts consequently always have fewer legs or conversely those with many legs have simpler mouths why should the sepals petals stamens and pistils in any individual flower though fitted for such widely different purposes be all constructed on the same pattern on the theory of natural selection we can satisfactorily answer these questions in the vertebrata we see a series of internal vertebrг bearing certain processes and appendages in the articulata we see the body divided into a series of segments bearing external appendages and in flowering plants we see a series of successive spiral whorls of leaves an indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common characteristic as owen has observed of all low or little modified forms therefore we may readily believe that the unknown progenitor of the vertebrata possessed many vertebrг the unknown progenitor of the articulata many segments and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants many spiral whorls of leaves we have formerly seen that parts many times repeated are eminently liable to vary in number and structure consequently it is quite probable that natural selection during a long continued course of modification should have seized on a certain number of the primordially similar elements many times repeated and have adapted them to the most diverse purposes and as the whole amount of modification will have been effected by slight successive steps we need not wonder at discovering in such parts or organs a certain degree of fundamental resemblance retained by the strong principle of inheritance in the great class of molluscs though we can homologise the parts of one species with those of other and distinct species we can indicate but few serial homologies that is we are seldom enabled to say that one 438 part or organ is homologous with another in the same individual and we can understand this fact for in molluscs even in the lowest members of the class we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition of any one part as we find in the other great classes of the animal and vegetable kingdoms naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosed vertebrг the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs the stamens and pistils of flowers as metamorphosed leaves but it would in these cases probably be more correct as professor huxley has remarked to speak of both skull and vertebrг both jaws and legs c as having been metamorphosed not one from the other but from some common element naturalists however use such language only in a metaphorical sense they are far from meaning that during a long course of descent primordial organs of any kind vertebrг in the one case and legs in the other have actually been modified into skulls or jaws yet so strong is the appearance of a modification of this nature having occurred that naturalists can hardly avoid employing language having this plain signification on my view these terms may be used literally and the wonderful fact of the jaws for instance of a crab retaining numerous characters which they would probably have retained through inheritance if they had really been metamorphosed during a long course of descent from true legs or from some simple appendage is explained embryology it has already been casually remarked that certain organs in the individual which when mature become widely different and serve for different purposes are in the embryo exactly alike the embryos also of distinct animals within the same class are often strikingly similar a better proof of this cannot be given than a 439 circumstance mentioned by agassiz namely that having forgotten to ticket the embryo of some vertebrate animal he cannot now tell whether it be that of a mammal bird or reptile the vermiform larvг of moths flies beetles c resemble each other much more closely than do the mature insects but in the case of larvг the embryos are active and have been adapted for special lines of life a trace of the law of embryonic resemblance sometimes lasts till a rather late age thus birds of the same genus and of closely allied genera often resemble each other in their first and second plumage as we see in the spotted feathers in the thrush group in the cat tribe most of the species are striped or spotted in lines and stripes can be plainly distinguished in the whelp of the lion we occasionally though rarely see something of this kind in plants thus the embryonic leaves of the ulex or furze and the first leaves of the phyllodineous acaceas are pinnate or divided like the ordinary leaves of the leguminosг the points of structure in which the embryos of widely different animals of the same class resemble each other often have no direct relation to their conditions of existence we cannot for instance suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop like course of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similar conditions in the young mammal which is nourished in the womb of its mother in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest and in the spawn of a frog under water we have no more reason to believe in such a relation than we have to believe that the same bones in the hand of a man wing of a bat and fin of a porpoise are related to similar conditions of life no one will suppose that the stripes on the whelp of a lion or the spots on the young blackbird 440 are of any use to these animals or are related to the conditions to which they are exposed the case however is different when an animal during any part of its embryonic career is active and has to provide for itself the period of activity may come on earlier or later in life but whenever it comes on the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as perfect and as beautiful as in the adult animal from such special adaptations the similarity of the larvг or active embryos of allied animals is sometimes much obscured and cases could be given of the larvг of two species or of two groups of species differing quite as much or even more from each other than do their adult parents in most cases however the larvг though active still obey more or less closely the law of common embryonic resemblance cirripedes afford a good instance of this even the illustrious cuvier did not perceive that a barnacle was as it certainly is a crustacean but a glance at the larva shows this to be the case in an unmistakeable manner so again the two main divisions of cirripedes the pedunculated and sessile which differ widely in external appearance have larvг in all their stages barely distinguishable the embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation i use this expression though i am aware that it is hardly possible to define clearly what is meant by the organisation being higher or lower but no one probably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than the caterpillar in some cases however the mature animal is generally considered as lower in the scale than the larva as with certain parasitic crustaceans to refer once again to cirripedes the larvг in the first stage have three pairs of legs a very simple single eye and a probosciformed mouth with which they feed largely for they increase much in 441 size in the second stage answering to the chrysalis stage of butterflies they have six pairs of beautifully constructed natatory legs a pair of magnificent compound eyes and extremely complex antennг but they have a closed and imperfect mouth and cannot feed their function at this stage is to search by their well developed organs of sense and to reach by their active powers of swimming a proper place on which to become attached and to undergo their final metamorphosis when this is completed they are fixed for life their legs are now converted into prehensile organs they again obtain a well constructed mouth but they have no antennг and their two eyes are now reconverted into a minute single and very simple eye spot in this last and complete state cirripedes may be considered as either more highly or more lowly organised than they were in the larval condition but in some genera the larvг become developed either into hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure or into what i have called complemental males and in the latter the development has assuredly been retrograde for the male is a mere sack which lives for a short time and is destitute of mouth stomach or other organ of importance excepting for reproduction we are so much accustomed to see differences in structure between the embryo and the adult and likewise a close similarity in the embryos of widely different animals within the same class that we might be led to look at these facts as necessarily contingent in some manner on growth but there is no obvious reason why for instance the wing of a bat or the fin of a porpoise should not have been sketched out with all the parts in proper proportion as soon as any structure became visible in the embryo and in some whole groups of animals and in certain members of other groups the embryo does not at any period differ widely from the 442 adult thus owen has remarked in regard to cuttle fish there is no metamorphosis the cephalopodic character is manifested long before the parts of the embryo are completed and again in spiders there is nothing worthy to be called a metamorphosis the larvг of insects whether adapted to the most diverse and active habits or quite inactive being fed by their parents or placed in the midst of proper nutriment yet nearly all pass through a similar worm like stage of development but in some few cases as in that of aphis if we look to the admirable drawings by professor huxley of the development of this insect we see no trace of the vermiform stage how then can we explain these several facts in embryology namely the very general but not universal difference in structure between the embryo and the adult of parts in the same individual embryo which ultimately become very unlike and serve for diverse purposes being at this early period of growth alike of embryos of different species within the same class generally but not universally resembling each other of the structure of the embryo not being closely related to its conditions of existence except when the embryo becomes at any period of life active and has to provide for itself of the embryo apparently having sometimes a higher organisation than the mature animal into which it is developed i believe that all these facts can be explained as follows on the view of descent with modification it is commonly assumed perhaps from monstrosities often affecting the embryos at a very early period that slight variations necessarily appear at an equally early period but we have little evidence on this head indeed the evidence rather points the other way for it is notorious that breeders of cattle horses and various 443 fancy animals cannot positively tell until some time after the animal has been born what its merits or form will ultimately turn out we see this plainly in our own children we cannot always tell whether the child will be tall or short or what its precise features will be the question is not at what period of life any variation has been caused but at what period it is fully displayed the cause may have acted and i believe generally has acted even before the embryo is formed and the variation may be due to the male and female sexual elements having been affected by the conditions to which either parent or their ancestors have been exposed nevertheless an effect thus caused at a very early period even before the formation of the embryo may appear late in life as when an hereditary disease which appears in old age alone has been communicated to the offspring from the reproductive element of one parent or again as when the horns of cross bred cattle have been affected by the shape of the horns of either parent for the welfare of a very young animal as long as it remains in its mother s womb or in the egg or as long as it is nourished and protected by its parent it must be quite unimportant whether most of its characters are fully acquired a little earlier or later in life it would not signify for instance to a bird which obtained its food best by having a long beak whether or not it assumed a beak of this particular length as long as it was fed by its parents hence i conclude that it is quite possible that each of the many successive modifications by which each species has acquired its present structure may have supervened at a not very early period of life and some direct evidence from our domestic animals supports this view but in other cases it is quite possible that each successive modification or 444 most of them may have appeared at an extremely early period i have stated in the first chapter that there is some evidence to render it probable that at whatever age any variation first appears in the parent it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in the offspring certain variations can only appear at corresponding ages for instance peculiarities in the caterpillar cocoon or imago states of the silk moth or again in the horns of almost full grown cattle but further than this variations which for all that we can see might have appeared earlier or later in life tend to appear at a corresponding age in the offspring and parent i am far from meaning that this is invariably the case and i could give a good many cases of variations taking the word in the largest sense which have supervened at an earlier age in the child than in the parent these two principles if their truth be admitted will i believe explain all the above specified leading facts in embryology but first let us look at a few analogous cases in domestic varieties some authors who have written on dogs maintain that the greyhound and bulldog though appearing so different are really varieties most closely allied and have probably descended from the same wild stock hence i was curious to see how far their puppies differed from each other i was told by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents and this judging by the eye seemed almost to be the case but on actually measuring the old dogs and their six days old puppies i found that the puppies had not nearly acquired their full amount of proportional difference so again i was told that the foals of cart and race horses differed as much as the full grown animals and this surprised me greatly as i think it probable that the difference between these two breeds has been wholly 445 caused by selection under domestication but having had careful measurements made of the dam and of a three days old colt of a race and heavy cart horse i find that the colts have by no means acquired their full amount of proportional difference as the evidence appears to me conclusive that the several domestic breeds of pigeon have descended from one wild species i compared young pigeons of various breeds within twelve hours after being hatched i carefully measured the proportions but will not here give details of the beak width of mouth length of nostril and of eyelid size of feet and length of leg in the wild stock in pouters fantails runts barbs dragons carriers and tumblers now some of these birds when mature differ so extraordinarily in length and form of beak that they would i cannot doubt be ranked in distinct genera had they been natural productions but when the nestling birds of these several breeds were placed in a row though most of them could be distinguished from each other yet their proportional differences in the above specified several points were incomparably less than in the full grown birds some characteristic points of difference for instance that of the width of mouth could hardly be detected in the young but there was one remarkable exception to this rule for the young of the short faced tumbler differed from the young of the wild rock pigeon and of the other breeds in all its proportions almost exactly as much as in the adult state the two principles above given seem to me to explain these facts in regard to the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties fanciers select their horses dogs and pigeons for breeding when they are nearly grown up they are indifferent whether the desired qualities and structures have been acquired earlier or 446 later in life if the full grown animal possesses them and the cases just given more especially that of pigeons seem to show that the characteristic differences which give value to each breed and which have been accumulated by man s selection have not generally first appeared at an early period of life and have been inherited by the offspring at a corresponding not early period but the case of the short faced tumbler which when twelve hours old had acquired its proper proportions proves that this is not the universal rule for here the characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier period than usual or if not so the differences must have been inherited not at the corresponding but at an earlier age now let us apply these facts and the above two principles which latter though not proved true can be shown to be in some degree probable to species in a state of nature let us take a genus of birds descended on my theory from some one parent species and of which the several new species have become modified through natural selection in accordance with their diverse habits then from the many slight successive steps of variation having supervened at a rather late age and having been inherited at a corresponding age the young of the new species of our supposed genus will manifestly tend to resemble each other much more closely than do the adults just as we have seen in the case of pigeons we may extend this view to whole families or even classes the fore limbs for instance which served as legs in the parent species may have become by a long course of modification adapted in one descendant to act as hands in another as paddles in another as wings and on the above two principles namely of each successive modification supervening at a rather late age and being inherited at a 447 corresponding late age the fore limbs in the embryos of the several descendants of the parent species will still resemble each other closely for they will not have been modified but in each of our new species the embryonic fore limbs will differ greatly from the fore limbs in the mature animal the limbs in the latter having undergone much modification at a rather late period of life and having thus been converted into hands or paddles or wings whatever influence long continued exercise or use on the one hand and disuse on the other may have in modifying an organ such influence will mainly affect the mature animal which has come to its full powers of activity and has to gain its own living and the effects thus produced will be inherited at a corresponding mature age whereas the young will remain unmodified or be modified in a lesser degree by the effects of use and disuse in certain cases the successive steps of variation might supervene from causes of which we are wholly ignorant at a very early period of life or each step might be inherited at an earlier period than that at which it first appeared in either case as with the short faced tumbler the young or embryo would closely resemble the mature parent form we have seen that this is the rule of development in certain whole groups of animals as with cuttle fish and spiders and with a few members of the great class of insects as with aphis with respect to the final cause of the young in these cases not undergoing any metamorphosis or closely resembling their parents from their earliest age we can see that this would result from the two following contingencies firstly from the young during a course of modification carried on for many generations having to provide for their own wants at a very early stage 448 of development and secondly from their following exactly the same habits of life with their parents for in this case it would be indispensable for the existence of the species that the child should be modified at a very early age in the same manner with its parents in accordance with their similar habits some further explanation however of the embryo not undergoing any metamorphosis is perhaps requisite if on the other hand it profited the young to follow habits of life in any degree different from those of their parent and consequently to be constructed in a slightly different manner then on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages the active young or larvг might easily be rendered by natural selection different to any conceivable extent from their parents such differences might also become correlated with successive stages of development so that the larvг in the first stage might differ greatly from the larvг in the second stage as we have seen to be the case with cirripedes the adult might become fitted for sites or habits in which organs of locomotion or of the senses c would be useless and in this case the final metamorphosis would be said to be retrograde as all the organic beings extinct and recent which have ever lived on this earth have to be classed together and as all have been connected by the finest gradations the best or indeed if our collections were nearly perfect the only possible arrangement would be genealogical descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the natural system on this view we can understand how it is that in the eyes of most naturalists the structure of the embryo is even more important for classification than that of the adult for the embryo is the animal in its less modified state 449 and in so far it reveals the structure of its progenitor in two groups of animals however much they may at present differ from each other in structure and habits if they pass through the same or similar embryonic stages we may feel assured that they have both descended from the same or nearly similar parents and are therefore in that degree closely related thus community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent it will reveal this community of descent however much the structure of the adult may have been modified and obscured we have seen for instance that cirripedes can at once be recognised by their larvг as belonging to the great class of crustaceans as the embryonic state of each species and group of species partially shows us the structure of their less modified ancient progenitors we can clearly see why ancient and extinct forms of life should resemble the embryos of their descendants our existing species agassiz believes this to be a law of nature but i am bound to confess that i only hope to see the law hereafter proved true it can be proved true in those cases alone in which the ancient state now supposed to be represented in existing embryos has not been obliterated either by the successive variations in a long course of modification having supervened at a very early age or by the variations having been inherited at an earlier period than that at which they first appeared it should also be borne in mind that the supposed law of resemblance of ancient forms of life to the embryonic stages of recent forms may be true but yet owing to the geological record not extending far enough back in time may remain for a long period or for ever incapable of demonstration thus as it seems to me the leading facts in embryology which are second in importance to none in natural history are explained on the principle of slight 450 modifications not appearing in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor at a very early period in the life of each though perhaps caused at the earliest and being inherited at a corresponding not early period embryology rises greatly in interest when we thus look at the embryo as a picture more or less obscured of the common parent form of each great class of animals rudimentary atrophied or aborted organs organs or parts in this strange condition bearing the stamp of inutility are extremely common throughout nature for instance rudimentary mammг are very general in the males of mammals i presume that the bastard wing in birds may be safely considered as a digit in a rudimentary state in very many snakes one lobe of the lungs is rudimentary in other snakes there are rudiments of the pelvis and hind limbs some of the cases of rudimentary organs are extremely curious for instance the presence of teeth in foetal whales which when grown up have not a tooth in their heads and the presence of teeth which never cut through the gums in the upper jaws of our unborn calves it has even been stated on good authority that rudiments of teeth can be detected in the beaks of certain embryonic birds nothing can be plainer than that wings are formed for flight yet in how many insects do we see wings so reduced in size as to be utterly incapable of flight and not rarely lying under wing cases firmly soldered together the meaning of rudimentary organs is often quite unmistakeable for instance there are beetles of the same genus and even of the same species resembling each other most closely in all respects one of which will have full sized wings and another mere rudiments of membrane and here it is impossible to doubt that the 451 rudiments represent wings rudimentary organs sometimes retain their potentiality and are merely not developed this seems to be the case with the mammг of male mammals for many instances are on record of these organs having become well developed in full grown males and having secreted milk so again there are normally four developed and two rudimentary teats in the udders of the genus bos but in our domestic cows the two sometimes become developed and give milk in plants of the same species the petals sometimes occur as mere rudiments and sometimes in a well developed state in plants with separated sexes the male flowers often have a rudiment of a pistil and kг lreuter found that by crossing such male plants with an hermaphrodite species the rudiment of the pistil in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size and this shows that the rudiment and the perfect pistil are essentially alike in nature an organ serving for two purposes may become rudimentary or utterly aborted for one even the more important purpose and remain perfectly efficient for the other thus in plants the office of the pistil is to allow the pollen tubes to reach the ovules protected in the ovarium at its base the pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style but in some compositг the male florets which of course cannot be fecundated have a pistil which is in a rudimentary state for it is not crowned with a stigma but the style remains well developed and is clothed with hairs as in other compositг for the purpose of brushing the pollen out of the surrounding anthers again an organ may become rudimentary for its proper purpose and be used for a distinct object in certain fish the swim bladder seems to be nearly rudimentary for its proper function of giving buoyancy but has become converted into a 452 nascent breathing organ or lung other similar instances could be given organs however little developed if of use should not be called rudimentary they cannot properly be said to be in an atrophied condition they may be called nascent and may hereafter be developed to any extent by natural selection rudimentary organs on the other hand are essentially useless as teeth which never cut through the gums in a still less developed condition they would be of still less use they cannot therefore under their present condition have been formed by natural selection which acts solely by the preservation of useful modifications they have been retained as we shall see by inheritance and relate to a former condition of their possessor it is difficult to know what are nascent organs looking to the future we cannot of course tell how any part will be developed and whether it is now nascent looking to the past creatures with an organ in a nascent condition will generally have been supplanted and exterminated by their successors with the organ in a more perfect and developed condition the wing of the penguin is of high service and acts as a fin it may therefore represent the nascent state of the wings of birds not that i believe this to be the case it is more probably a reduced organ modified for a new function the wing of the apteryx is useless and is truly rudimentary the mammary glands of the ornithorhynchus may perhaps be considered in comparison with the udder of a cow as in a nascent state the ovigerous frena of certain cirripedes which are only slightly developed and which have ceased to give attachment to the ova are nascent branchiг rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are very liable to vary in degree of development 453 and in other respects moreover in closely allied species the degree to which the same organ has been rendered rudimentary occasionally differs much this latter fact is well exemplified in the state of the wings of the female moths in certain groups rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted and this implies that we find in an animal or plant no trace of an organ which analogy would lead us to expect to find and which is occasionally found in monstrous individuals of the species thus in the snapdragon antirrhinum we generally do not find a rudiment of a fifth stamen but this may sometimes be seen in tracing the homologies of the same part in different members of a class nothing is more common or more necessary than the use and discovery of rudiments this is well shown in the drawings given by owen of the bones of the leg of the horse ox and rhinoceros it is an important fact that rudimentary organs such as teeth in the upper jaws of whales and ruminants can often be detected in the embryo but afterwards wholly disappear it is also i believe a universal rule that a rudimentary part or organ is of greater size relatively to the adjoining parts in the embryo than in the adult so that the organ at this early age is less rudimentary or even cannot be said to be in any degree rudimentary hence also a rudimentary organ in the adult is often said to have retained its embryonic condition i have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs in reflecting on them every one must be struck with astonishment for the same reasoning power which tells us plainly that most parts and organs are exquisitely adapted for certain purposes tells us with equal plainness that these rudimentary or atrophied organs are imperfect and useless in works 454 on natural history rudimentary organs are generally said to have been created for the sake of symmetry or in order to complete the scheme of nature but this seems to me no explanation merely a re statement of the fact would it be thought sufficient to say that because planets revolve in elliptic courses round the sun satellites follow the same course round the planets for the sake of symmetry and to complete the scheme of nature an eminent physiologist accounts for the presence of rudimentary organs by supposing that they serve to excrete matter in excess or injurious to the system but can we suppose that the minute papilla which often represents the pistil in male flowers and which is formed merely of cellular tissue can thus act can we suppose that the formation of rudimentary teeth which are subsequently absorbed can be of any service to the rapidly growing embryonic calf by the excretion of precious phosphate of lime when a man s fingers have been amputated imperfect nails sometimes appear on the stumps i could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails have appeared not from unknown laws of growth but in order to excrete horny matter as that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee were formed for this purpose on my view of descent with modification the origin of rudimentary organs is simple we have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in our domestic productions as the stump of a tail in tailless breeds the vestige of an ear in earless breeds the reappearance of minute dangling horns in hornless breeds of cattle more especially according to youatt in young animals and the state of the whole flower in the cauliflower we often see rudiments of various parts in monsters but i doubt whether any of these cases throw light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of nature 455 further than by showing that rudiments can be produced for i doubt whether species under nature ever undergo abrupt changes i believe that disuse has been the main agency that it has led in successive generations to the gradual reduction of various organs until they have become rudimentary as in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark caverns and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands which have seldom been forced to take flight and have ultimately lost the power of flying again an organ useful under certain conditions might become injurious under others as with the wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands and in this case natural selection would continue slowly to reduce the organ until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary any change in function which can be effected by insensibly small steps is within the power of natural selection so that an organ rendered during changed habits of life useless or injurious for one purpose might be modified and used for another purpose or an organ might be retained for one alone of its former functions an organ when rendered useless may well be variable for its variations cannot be checked by natural selection at whatever period of life disuse or selection reduces an organ and this will generally be when the being has come to maturity and to its full powers of action the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages will reproduce the organ in its reduced state at the same age and consequently will seldom affect or reduce it in the embryo thus we can understand the greater relative size of rudimentary organs in the embryo and their lesser relative size in the adult but if each step of the process of reduction were to be inherited not at the corresponding age but at an extremely early period of life as we have good 456 reason to believe to be possible the rudimentary part would tend to be wholly lost and we should have a case of complete abortion the principle also of economy explained in a former chapter by which the materials forming any part or structure if not useful to the possessor will be saved as far as is possible will probably often come into play and this will tend to cause the entire obliteration of a rudimentary organ as the presence of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendency in every part of the organisation which has long existed to be inherited we can understand on the genealogical view of classification how it is that systematists have found rudimentary parts as useful as or even sometimes more useful than parts of high physiological importance rudimentary organs may be compared with the letters in a word still retained in the spelling but become useless in the pronunciation but which serve as a clue in seeking for its derivation on the view of descent with modification we may conclude that the existence of organs in a rudimentary imperfect and useless condition or quite aborted far from presenting a strange difficulty as they assuredly do on the ordinary doctrine of creation might even have been anticipated and can be accounted for by the laws of inheritance summary in this chapter i have attempted to show that the subordination of group to group in all organisms throughout all time that the nature of the relationship by which all living and extinct beings are united by complex radiating and circuitous lines of affinities into one grand system the rules followed and the difficulties encountered by naturalists in their classifications the value set upon characters if constant and prevalent whether of high vital importance or of the most trifling 457 importance or as in rudimentary organs of no importance the wide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive characters and characters of true affinity and other such rules all naturally follow on the view of the common parentage of those forms which are considered by naturalists as allied together with their modification through natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of character in considering this view of classification it should be borne in mind that the element of descent has been universally used in ranking together the sexes ages and acknowledged varieties of the same species however different they may be in structure if we extend the use of this element of descent the only certainly known cause of similarity in organic beings we shall understand what is meant by the natural system it is genealogical in its attempted arrangement with the grades of acquired difference marked by the terms varieties species genera families orders and classes on this same view of descent with modification all the great facts in morphology become intelligible whether we look to the same pattern displayed in the homologous organs to whatever purpose applied of the different species of a class or to the homologous parts constructed on the same pattern in each individual animal and plant on the principle of successive slight variations not necessarily or generally supervening at a very early period of life and being inherited at a corresponding period we can understand the great leading facts in embryology namely the resemblance in an individual embryo of the homologous parts which when matured will become widely different from each other in structure and function and the resemblance in different species of a class of the homologous parts or 458 organs though fitted in the adult members for purposes as different as possible larvг are active embryos which have become specially modified in relation to their habits of life through the principle of modifications being inherited at corresponding ages on this same principle and bearing in mind that when organs are reduced in size either from disuse or selection it will generally be at that period of life when the being has to provide for its own wants and bearing in mind how strong is the principle of inheritance the occurrence of rudimentary organs and their final abortion present to us no inexplicable difficulties on the contrary their presence might have been even anticipated the importance of embryological characters and of rudimentary organs in classification is intelligible on the view that an arrangement is only so far natural as it is genealogical finally the several classes of facts which have been considered in this chapter seem to me to proclaim so plainly that the innumerable species genera and families of organic beings with which this world is peopled have all descended each within its own class or group from common parents and have all been modified in the course of descent that i should without hesitation adopt this view even if it were unsupported by other facts or arguments 459 chapter xiv recapitulation and conclusion recapitulation of the difficulties on the theory of natural selection recapitulation of the general and special circumstances in its favour causes of the general belief in the immutability of species how far the theory of natural selection may be extended effects of its adoption on the study of natural history concluding remarks as this whole volume is one long argument it may be convenient to the reader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated that many and serious objections may be advanced against the theory of descent with modification through natural selection i do not deny i have endeavoured to give to them their full force nothing at first can appear more difficult to believe than that the more complex organs and instincts should have been perfected not by means superior to though analogous with human reason but by the accumulation of innumerable slight variations each good for the individual possessor nevertheless this difficulty though appearing to our imagination insuperably great cannot be considered real if we admit the following propositions namely that gradations in the perfection of any organ or instinct which we may consider either do now exist or could have existed each good of its kind that all organs and instincts are in ever so slight a degree variable and lastly that there is a struggle for existence leading to the preservation of each profitable deviation of structure or instinct the truth of these propositions cannot i think be disputed 460 it is no doubt extremely difficult even to conjecture by what gradations many structures have been perfected more especially amongst broken and failing groups of organic beings but we see so many strange gradations in nature that we ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or instinct or any whole being could not have arrived at its present state by many graduated steps there are it must be admitted cases of special difficulty on the theory of natural selection and one of the most curious of these is the existence of two or three defined castes of workers or sterile females in the same community of ants but i have attempted to show how this difficulty can be mastered with respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first crossed which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal fertility of varieties when crossed i must refer the reader to the recapitulation of the facts given at the end of the eighth chapter which seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special endowment than is the incapacity of two trees to be grafted together but that it is incidental on constitutional differences in the reproductive systems of the intercrossed species we see the truth of this conclusion in the vast difference in the result when the same two species are crossed reciprocally that is when one species is first used as the father and then as the mother the fertility of varieties when intercrossed and of their mongrel offspring cannot be considered as universal nor is their very general fertility surprising when we remember that it is not likely that either their constitutions or their reproductive systems should have been profoundly modified moreover most of the varieties which have been experimentised on have been 461 produced under domestication and as domestication i do not mean mere confinement apparently tends to eliminate sterility we ought not to expect it also to produce sterility the sterility of hybrids is a very different case from that of first crosses for their reproductive organs are more or less functionally impotent whereas in first crosses the organs on both sides are in a perfect condition as we continually see that organisms of all kinds are rendered in some degree sterile from their constitutions having been disturbed by slightly different and new conditions of life we need not feel surprise at hybrids being in some degree sterile for their constitutions can hardly fail to have been disturbed from being compounded of two distinct organisations this parallelism is supported by another parallel but directly opposite class of facts namely that the vigour and fertility of all organic beings are increased by slight changes in their conditions of life and that the offspring of slightly modified forms or varieties acquire from being crossed increased vigour and fertility so that on the one hand considerable changes in the conditions of life and crosses between greatly modified forms lessen fertility and on the other hand lesser changes in the conditions of life and crosses between less modified forms increase fertility turning to geographical distribution the difficulties encountered on the theory of descent with modification are grave enough all the individuals of the same species and all the species of the same genus or even higher group must have descended from common parents and therefore in however distant and isolated parts of the world they are now found they must in the course of successive generations have passed from some one part to the others we are often wholly unable 462 even to conjecture how this could have been effected yet as we have reason to believe that some species have retained the same specific form for very long periods enormously long as measured by years too much stress ought not to be laid on the occasional wide diffusion of the same species for during very long periods of time there will always have been a good chance for wide migration by many means a broken or interrupted range may often be accounted for by the extinction of the species in the intermediate regions it cannot be denied that we are as yet very ignorant of the full extent of the various climatal and geographical changes which have affected the earth during modern periods and such changes will obviously have greatly facilitated migration as an example i have attempted to show how potent has been the influence of the glacial period on the distribution both of the same and of representative species throughout the world we are as yet profoundly ignorant of the many occasional means of transport with respect to distinct species of the same genus inhabiting very distant and isolated regions as the process of modification has necessarily been slow all the means of migration will have been possible during a very long period and consequently the difficulty of the wide diffusion of species of the same genus is in some degree lessened as on the theory of natural selection an interminable number of intermediate forms must have existed linking together all the species in each group by gradations as fine as our present varieties it may be asked why do we not see these linking forms all around us why are not all organic beings blended together in an inextricable chaos with respect to existing forms we should remember that we have no right to expect excepting in rare cases to discover directly connecting 463 links between them but only between each and some extinct and supplanted form even on a wide area which has during a long period remained continuous and of which the climate and other conditions of life change insensibly in going from a district occupied by one species into another district occupied by a closely allied species we have no just right to expect often to find intermediate varieties in the intermediate zone for we have reason to believe that only a few species are undergoing change at any one period and all changes are slowly effected i have also shown that the intermediate varieties which will at first probably exist in the intermediate zones will be liable to be supplanted by the allied forms on either hand and the latter from existing in greater numbers will generally be modified and improved at a quicker rate than the intermediate varieties which exist in lesser numbers so that the intermediate varieties will in the long run be supplanted and exterminated on this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connecting links between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world and at each successive period between the extinct and still older species why is not every geological formation charged with such links why does not every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of the gradation and mutation of the forms of life we meet with no such evidence and this is the most obvious and forcible of the many objections which may be urged against my theory why again do whole groups of allied species appear though certainly they often falsely appear to have come in suddenly on the several geological stages why do we not find great piles of strata beneath the silurian system stored with the remains of the progenitors of the silurian groups of fossils for certainly on my theory such 464 strata must somewhere have been deposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs in the world s history i can answer these questions and grave objections only on the supposition that the geological record is far more imperfect than most geologists believe it cannot be objected that there has not been time sufficient for any amount of organic change for the lapse of time has been so great as to be utterly inappreciable by the human intellect the number of specimens in all our museums is absolutely as nothing compared with the countless generations of countless species which certainly have existed we should not be able to recognise a species as the parent of any one or more species if we were to examine them ever so closely unless we likewise possessed many of the intermediate links between their past or parent and present states and these many links we could hardly ever expect to discover owing to the imperfection of the geological record numerous existing doubtful forms could be named which are probably varieties but who will pretend that in future ages so many fossil links will be discovered that naturalists will be able to decide on the common view whether or not these doubtful forms are varieties as long as most of the links between any two species are unknown if any one link or intermediate variety be discovered it will simply be classed as another and distinct species only a small portion of the world has been geologically explored only organic beings of certain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition at least in any great number widely ranging species vary most and varieties are often at first local both causes rendering the discovery of intermediate links less likely local varieties will not spread into other and distant regions until they are considerably modified and 465 improved and when they do spread if discovered in a geological formation they will appear as if suddenly created there and will be simply classed as new species most formations have been intermittent in their accumulation and their duration i am inclined to believe has been shorter than the average duration of specific forms successive formations are separated from each other by enormous blank intervals of time for fossiliferous formations thick enough to resist future degradation can be accumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the subsiding bed of the sea during the alternate periods of elevation and of stationary level the record will be blank during these latter periods there will probably be more variability in the forms of life during periods of subsidence more extinction with respect to the absence of fossiliferous formations beneath the lowest silurian strata i can only recur to the hypothesis given in the ninth chapter that the geological record is imperfect all will admit but that it is imperfect to the degree which i require few will be inclined to admit if we look to long enough intervals of time geology plainly declares that all species have changed and they have changed in the manner which my theory requires for they have changed slowly and in a graduated manner we clearly see this in the fossil remains from consecutive formations invariably being much more closely related to each other than are the fossils from formations distant from each other in time such is the sum of the several chief objections and difficulties which may justly be urged against my theory and i have now briefly recapitulated the answers and explanations which can be given to them i have felt these difficulties far too heavily during many years to 466 doubt their weight but it deserves especial notice that the more important objections relate to questions on which we are confessedly ignorant nor do we know how ignorant we are we do not know all the possible transitional gradations between the simplest and the most perfect organs it cannot be pretended that we know all the varied means of distribution during the long lapse of years or that we know how imperfect the geological record is grave as these several difficulties are in my judgment they do not overthrow the theory of descent from a few created forms with subsequent modification now let us turn to the other side of the argument under domestication we see much variability this seems to be mainly due to the reproductive system being eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life so that this system when not rendered impotent fails to reproduce offspring exactly like the parent form variability is governed by many complex laws by correlation of growth by use and disuse and by the direct action of the physical conditions of life there is much difficulty in ascertaining how much modification our domestic productions have undergone but we may safely infer that the amount has been large and that modifications can be inherited for long periods as long as the conditions of life remain the same we have reason to believe that a modification which has already been inherited for many generations may continue to be inherited for an almost infinite number of generations on the other hand we have evidence that variability when it has once come into play does not wholly cease for new varieties are still occasionally produced by our most anciently domesticated productions 467 man does not actually produce variability he only unintentionally exposes organic beings to new conditions of life and then nature acts on the organisation and causes variability but man can and does select the variations given to him by nature and thus accumulate them in any desired manner he thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit or pleasure he may do this methodically or he may do it unconsciously by preserving the individuals most useful to him at the time without any thought of altering the breed it is certain that he can largely influence the character of a breed by selecting in each successive generation individual differences so slight as to be quite inappreciable by an uneducated eye this process of selection has been the great agency in the production of the most distinct and useful domestic breeds that many of the breeds produced by man have to a large extent the character of natural species is shown by the inextricable doubts whether very many of them are varieties or aboriginal species there is no obvious reason why the principles which have acted so efficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature in the preservation of favoured individuals and races during the constantly recurrent struggle for existence we see the most powerful and ever acting means of selection the struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of increase which is common to all organic beings this high rate of increase is proved by calculation by the rapid increase of many animals and plants during a succession of peculiar seasons or when naturalised in a new country more individuals are born than can possibly survive a grain in the balance will determine which individual shall live and which shall die which variety or species shall increase in number and which 468 shall decrease or finally become extinct as the individuals of the same species come in all respects into the closest competition with each other the struggle will generally be most severe between them it will be almost equally severe between the varieties of the same species and next in severity between the species of the same genus but the struggle will often be very severe between beings most remote in the scale of nature the slightest advantage in one being at any age or during any season over those with which it comes into competition or better adaptation in however slight a degree to the surrounding physical conditions will turn the balance with animals having separated sexes there will in most cases be a struggle between the males for possession of the females the most vigorous individuals or those which have most successfully struggled with their conditions of life will generally leave most progeny but success will often depend on having special weapons or means of defence or on the charms of the males and the slightest advantage will lead to victory as geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physical changes we might have expected that organic beings would have varied under nature in the same way as they generally have varied under the changed conditions of domestication and if there be any variability under nature it would be an unaccountable fact if natural selection had not come into play it has often been asserted but the assertion is quite incapable of proof that the amount of variation under nature is a strictly limited quantity man though acting on external characters alone and often capriciously can produce within a short period a great result by adding up mere individual differences in his domestic productions and every one admits that there are at least individual differences in species under 469 nature but besides such differences all naturalists have admitted the existence of varieties which they think sufficiently distinct to be worthy of record in systematic works no one can draw any clear distinction between individual differences and slight varieties or between more plainly marked varieties and sub species and species let it be observed how naturalists differ in the rank which they assign to the many representative forms in europe and north america if then we have under nature variability and a powerful agent always ready to act and select why should we doubt that variations in any way useful to beings under their excessively complex relations of life would be preserved accumulated and inherited why if man can by patience select variations most useful to himself should nature fail in selecting variations useful under changing conditions of life to her living products what limit can be put to this power acting during long ages and rigidly scrutinising the whole constitution structure and habits of each creature favouring the good and rejecting the bad i can see no limit to this power in slowly and beautifully adapting each form to the most complex relations of life the theory of natural selection even if we looked no further than this seems to me to be in itself probable i have already recapitulated as fairly as i could the opposed difficulties and objections now let us turn to the special facts and arguments in favour of the theory on the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties and that each species first existed as a variety we can see why it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species commonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation and varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary laws on this same 470 view we can understand how it is that in each region where many species of a genus have been produced and where they now flourish these same species should present many varieties for where the manufactory of species has been active we might expect as a general rule to find it still in action and this is the case if varieties be incipient species moreover the species of the larger genera which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient species retain to a certain degree the character of varieties for they differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the species of smaller genera the closely allied species also of the larger genera apparently have restricted ranges and in their affinities they are clustered in little groups round other species in which respects they resemble varieties these are strange relations on the view of each species having been independently created but are intelligible if all species first existed as varieties as each species tends by its geometrical ratio of reproduction to increase inordinately in number and as the modified descendants of each species will be enabled to increase by so much the more as they become diversified in habits and structure so as to be enabled to seize on many and widely different places in the economy of nature there will be a constant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent offspring of any one species hence during a long continued course of modification the slight differences characteristic of varieties of the same species tend to be augmented into the greater differences characteristic of species of the same genus new and improved varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older less improved and intermediate varieties and thus species are rendered to a large extent defined and distinct objects dominant species belonging to the 471 larger groups tend to give birth to new and dominant forms so that each large group tends to become still larger and at the same time more divergent in character but as all groups cannot thus succeed in increasing in size for the world would not hold them the more dominant groups beat the less dominant this tendency in the large groups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character together with the almost inevitable contingency of much extinction explains the arrangement of all the forms of life in groups subordinate to groups all within a few great classes which we now see everywhere around us and which has prevailed throughout all time this grand fact of the grouping of all organic beings seems to me utterly inexplicable on the theory of creation as natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight successive favourable variations it can produce no great or sudden modification it can act only by very short and slow steps hence the canon of natura non facit saltum which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends to make truer is on this theory simply intelligible we can plainly see why nature is prodigal in variety though niggard in innovation but why this should be a law of nature if each species has been independently created no man can explain many other facts are as it seems to me explicable on this theory how strange it is that a bird under the form of woodpecker should have been created to prey on insects on the ground that upland geese which never or rarely swim should have been created with webbed feet that a thrush should have been created to dive and feed on sub aquatic insects and that a petrel should have been created with habits and structure fitting it for the life of an auk or grebe and so on in endless other cases but on the view of each 472 species constantly trying to increase in number with natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varying descendants of each to any unoccupied or ill occupied place in nature these facts cease to be strange or perhaps might even have been anticipated as natural selection acts by competition it adapts the inhabitants of each country only in relation to the degree of perfection of their associates so that we need feel no surprise at the inhabitants of any one country although on the ordinary view supposed to have been specially created and adapted for that country being beaten and supplanted by the naturalised productions from another land nor ought we to marvel if all the contrivances in nature be not as far as we can judge absolutely perfect and if some of them be abhorrent to our ideas of fitness we need not marvel at the sting of the bee causing the bee s own death at drones being produced in such vast numbers for one single act with the great majority slaughtered by their sterile sisters at the astonishing waste of pollen by our fir trees at the instinctive hatred of the queen bee for her own fertile daughters at ichneumonidг feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars and at other such cases the wonder indeed is on the theory of natural selection that more cases of the want of absolute perfection have not been observed the complex and little known laws governing variation are the same as far as we can see with the laws which have governed the production of so called specific forms in both cases physical conditions seem to have produced but little direct effect yet when varieties enter any zone they occasionally assume some of the characters of the species proper to that zone in both varieties and species use and disuse seem to have produced some effect for it is difficult to resist this 473 conclusion when we look for instance at the logger headed duck which has wings incapable of flight in nearly the same condition as in the domestic duck or when we look at the burrowing tucutucu which is occasionally blind and then at certain moles which are habitually blind and have their eyes covered with skin or when we look at the blind animals inhabiting the dark caves of america and europe in both varieties and species correlation of growth seems to have played a most important part so that when one part has been modified other parts are necessarily modified in both varieties and species reversions to long lost characters occur how inexplicable on the theory of creation is the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulder and legs of the several species of the horse genus and in their hybrids how simply is this fact explained if we believe that these species have descended from a striped progenitor in the same manner as the several domestic breeds of pigeon have descended from the blue and barred rock pigeon on the ordinary view of each species having been independently created why should the specific characters or those by which the species of the same genus differ from each other be more variable than the generic characters in which they all agree why for instance should the colour of a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus if the other species supposed to have been created independently have differently coloured flowers than if all the species of the genus have the same coloured flowers if species are only well marked varieties of which the characters have become in a high degree permanent we can understand this fact for they have already varied since they branched off from a common progenitor in certain characters by which they have come to be specifically distinct from each other 474 and therefore these same characters would be more likely still to be variable than the generic characters which have been inherited without change for an enormous period it is inexplicable on the theory of creation why a part developed in a very unusual manner in any one species of a genus and therefore as we may naturally infer of great importance to the species should be eminently liable to variation but on my view this part has undergone since the several species branched off from a common progenitor an unusual amount of variability and modification and therefore we might expect this part generally to be still variable but a part may be developed in the most unusual manner like the wing of a bat and yet not be more variable than any other structure if the part be common to many subordinate forms that is if it has been inherited for a very long period for in this case it will have been rendered constant by long continued natural selection glancing at instincts marvellous as some are they offer no greater difficulty than does corporeal structure on the theory of the natural selection of successive slight but profitable modifications we can thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowing different animals of the same class with their several instincts i have attempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throws on the admirable architectural powers of the hive bee habit no doubt sometimes comes into play in modifying instincts but it certainly is not indispensable as we see in the case of neuter insects which leave no progeny to inherit the effects of long continued habit on the view of all the species of the same genus having descended from a common parent and having inherited much in common we can understand how it is that allied species when placed under considerably different conditions of life 475 yet should follow nearly the same instincts why the thrush of south america for instance lines her nest with mud like our british species on the view of instincts having been slowly acquired through natural selection we need not marvel at some instincts being apparently not perfect and liable to mistakes and at many instincts causing other animals to suffer if species be only well marked and permanent varieties we can at once see why their crossed offspring should follow the same complex laws in their degrees and kinds of resemblance to their parents in being absorbed into each other by successive crosses and in other such points as do the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties on the other hand these would be strange facts if species have been independently created and varieties have been produced by secondary laws if we admit that the geological record is imperfect in an extreme degree then such facts as the record gives support the theory of descent with modification new species have come on the stage slowly and at successive intervals and the amount of change after equal intervals of time is widely different in different groups the extinction of species and of whole groups of species which has played so conspicuous a part in the history of the organic world almost inevitably follows on the principle of natural selection for old forms will be supplanted by new and improved forms neither single species nor groups of species reappear when the chain of ordinary generation has once been broken the gradual diffusion of dominant forms with the slow modification of their descendants causes the forms of life after long intervals of time to appear as if they had changed simultaneously throughout the world the fact of the fossil remains of each formation being in some degree intermediate in character between the 476 fossils in the formations above and below is simply explained by their intermediate position in the chain of descent the grand fact that all extinct organic beings belong to the same system with recent beings falling either into the same or into intermediate groups follows from the living and the extinct being the offspring of common parents as the groups which have descended from an ancient progenitor have generally diverged in character the progenitor with its early descendants will often be intermediate in character in comparison with its later descendants and thus we can see why the more ancient a fossil is the oftener it stands in some degree intermediate between existing and allied groups recent forms are generally looked at as being in some vague sense higher than ancient and extinct forms and they are in so far higher as the later and more improved forms have conquered the older and less improved organic beings in the struggle for life lastly the law of the long endurance of allied forms on the same continent of marsupials in australia of edentata in america and other such cases is intelligible for within a confined country the recent and the extinct will naturally be allied by descent looking to geographical distribution if we admit that there has been during the long course of ages much migration from one part of the world to another owing to former climatal and geographical changes and to the many occasional and unknown means of dispersal then we can understand on the theory of descent with modification most of the great leading facts in distribution we can see why there should be so striking a parallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout space and in their geological succession throughout time for in both cases the beings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation and the means of 477 modification have been the same we see the full meaning of the wonderful fact which must have struck every traveller namely that on the same continent under the most diverse conditions under heat and cold on mountain and lowland on deserts and marshes most of the inhabitants within each great class are plainly related for they will generally be descendants of the same progenitors and early colonists on this same principle of former migration combined in most cases with modification we can understand by the aid of the glacial period the identity of some few plants and the close alliance of many others on the most distant mountains under the most different climates and likewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the sea in the northern and southern temperate zones though separated by the whole intertropical ocean although two areas may present the same physical conditions of life we need feel no surprise at their inhabitants being widely different if they have been for a long period completely separated from each other for as the relation of organism to organism is the most important of all relations and as the two areas will have received colonists from some third source or from each other at various periods and in different proportions the course of modification in the two areas will inevitably be different on this view of migration with subsequent modification we can see why oceanic islands should be inhabited by few species but of these that many should be peculiar we can clearly see why those animals which cannot cross wide spaces of ocean as frogs and terrestrial mammals should not inhabit oceanic islands and why on the other hand new and peculiar species of bats which can traverse the ocean should so often be found on islands far distant from any continent such facts 478 as the presence of peculiar species of bats and the absence of all other mammals on oceanic islands are utterly inexplicable on the theory of independent acts of creation the existence of closely allied or representative species in any two areas implies on the theory of descent with modification that the same parents formerly inhabited both areas and we almost invariably find that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two areas some identical species common to both still exist wherever many closely allied yet distinct species occur many doubtful forms and varieties of the same species likewise occur it is a rule of high generality that the inhabitants of each area are related to the inhabitants of the nearest source whence immigrants might have been derived we see this in nearly all the plants and animals of the galapagos archipelago of juan fernandez and of the other american islands being related in the most striking manner to the plants and animals of the neighbouring american mainland and those of the cape de verde archipelago and other african islands to the african mainland it must be admitted that these facts receive no explanation on the theory of creation the fact as we have seen that all past and present organic beings constitute one grand natural system with group subordinate to group and with extinct groups often falling in between recent groups is intelligible on the theory of natural selection with its contingencies of extinction and divergence of character on these same principles we see how it is that the mutual affinities of the species and genera within each class are so complex and circuitous we see why certain characters are far more serviceable than others for classification why adaptive characters though of paramount importance to the being are of hardly any 479 importance in classification why characters derived from rudimentary parts though of no service to the being are often of high classificatory value and why embryological characters are the most valuable of all the real affinities of all organic beings are due to inheritance or community of descent the natural system is a genealogical arrangement in which we have to discover the lines of descent by the most permanent characters however slight their vital importance may be the framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man wing of a bat fin of the porpoise and leg of the horse the same number of vertebrг forming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant and innumerable other such facts at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications the similarity of pattern in the wing and leg of a bat though used for such different purpose in the jaws and legs of a crab in the petals stamens and pistils of a flower is likewise intelligible on the view of the gradual modification of parts or organs which were alike in the early progenitor of each class on the principle of successive variations not always supervening at an early age and being inherited at a corresponding not early period of life we can clearly see why the embryos of mammals birds reptiles and fishes should be so closely alike and should be so unlike the adult forms we may cease marvelling at the embryo of an air breathing mammal or bird having branchial slits and arteries running in loops like those in a fish which has to breathe the air dissolved in water by the aid of well developed branchiг disuse aided sometimes by natural selection will often tend to reduce an organ when it has become useless by changed habits or under changed conditions 480 of life and we can clearly understand on this view the meaning of rudimentary organs but disuse and selection will generally act on each creature when it has come to maturity and has to play its full part in the struggle for existence and will thus have little power of acting on an organ during early life hence the organ will not be much reduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age the calf for instance has inherited teeth which never cut through the gums of the upper jaw from an early progenitor having well developed teeth and we may believe that the teeth in the mature animal were reduced during successive generations by disuse or by the tongue and palate having been better fitted by natural selection to browse without their aid whereas in the calf the teeth have been left untouched by selection or disuse and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages have been inherited from a remote period to the present day on the view of each organic being and each separate organ having been specially created how utterly inexplicable it is that parts like the teeth in the embryonic calf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing covers of some beetles should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal by rudimentary organs and by homologous structures her scheme of modification which it seems that we wilfully will not understand i have now recapitulated the chief facts and considerations which have thoroughly convinced me that species have been modified during a long course of descent by the preservation or the natural selection of many successive slight favourable variations i cannot believe that a false theory would explain as it seems to me that the theory of natural selection does explain 481 the several large classes of facts above specified i see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of any one a celebrated author and divine has written to me that he has gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble a conception of the deity to believe that he created a few original forms capable of self development into other and needful forms as to believe that he required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of his laws why it may be asked have all the most eminent living naturalists and geologists rejected this view of the mutability of species it cannot be asserted that organic beings in a state of nature are subject to no variation it cannot be proved that the amount of variation in the course of long ages is a limited quantity no clear distinction has been or can be drawn between species and well marked varieties it cannot be maintained that species when intercrossed are invariably sterile and varieties invariably fertile or that sterility is a special endowment and sign of creation the belief that species were immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the history of the world was thought to be of short duration and now that we have acquired some idea of the lapse of time we are too apt to assume without proof that the geological record is so perfect that it would have afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species if they had undergone mutation but the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that one species has given birth to other and distinct species is that we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see the intermediate steps the difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists when lyell first insisted that long 482 lines of inland cliffs had been formed and great valleys excavated by the slow action of the coast waves the mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of the term of a hundred million years it cannot add up and perceive the full effects of many slight variations accumulated during an almost infinite number of generations although i am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in this volume under the form of an abstract i by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude of facts all viewed during a long course of years from a point of view directly opposite to mine it is so easy to hide our ignorance under such expressions as the plan of creation unity of design c and to think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact any one whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplained difficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of facts will certainly reject my theory a few naturalists endowed with much flexibility of mind and who have already begun to doubt on the immutability of species may be influenced by this volume but i look with confidence to the future to young and rising naturalists who will be able to view both sides of the question with impartiality whoever is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction for only thus can the load of prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed several eminent naturalists have of late published their belief that a multitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species but that other species are real that is have been independently created this seems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at they admit that a multitude of forms which till lately 483 they themselves thought were special creations and which are still thus looked at by the majority of naturalists and which consequently have every external characteristic feature of true species they admit that these have been produced by variation but they refuse to extend the same view to other and very slightly different forms nevertheless they do not pretend that they can define or even conjecture which are the created forms of life and which are those produced by secondary laws they admit variation as a vera causa in one case they arbitrarily reject it in another without assigning any distinction in the two cases the day will come when this will be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceived opinion these authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act of creation than at an ordinary birth but do they really believe that at innumerable periods in the earth s history certain elemental atoms have been commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues do they believe that at each supposed act of creation one individual or many were produced were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plants created as eggs or seed or as full grown and in the case of mammals were they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from the mother s womb although naturalists very properly demand a full explanation of every difficulty from those who believe in the mutability of species on their own side they ignore the whole subject of the first appearance of species in what they consider reverent silence it may be asked how far i extend the doctrine of the modification of species the question is difficult to answer because the more distinct the forms are which we may consider by so much the arguments fall away in force but some arguments of the greatest weight 484 extend very far all the members of whole classes can be connected together by chains of affinities and all can be classified on the same principle in groups subordinate to groups fossil remains sometimes tend to fill up very wide intervals between existing orders organs in a rudimentary condition plainly show that an early progenitor had the organ in a fully developed state and this in some instances necessarily implies an enormous amount of modification in the descendants throughout whole classes various structures are formed on the same pattern and at an embryonic age the species closely resemble each other therefore i cannot doubt that the theory of descent with modification embraces all the members of the same class i believe that animals have descended from at most only four or five progenitors and plants from an equal or lesser number analogy would lead me one step further namely to the belief that all animals and plants have descended from some one prototype but analogy may be a deceitful guide nevertheless all living things have much in common in their chemical composition their germinal vesicles their cellular structure and their laws of growth and reproduction we see this even in so trifling a circumstance as that the same poison often similarly affects plants and animals or that the poison secreted by the gall fly produces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak tree therefore i should infer from analogy that probably all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from some one primordial form into which life was first breathed by the creator when the views advanced by me in this volume and by mr wallace in the linnean journal or when analogous views on the origin of species are generally 485 admitted we can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural history systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at present but they will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be in essence a species this i feel sure and i speak after experience will be no slight relief the endless disputes whether or not some fifty species of british brambles are true species will cease systematists will have only to decide not that this will be easy whether any form be sufficiently constant and distinct from other forms to be capable of definition and if definable whether the differences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific name this latter point will become a far more essential consideration than it is at present for differences however slight between any two forms if not blended by intermediate gradations are looked at by most naturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species hereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction between species and well marked varieties is that the latter are known or believed to be connected at the present day by intermediate gradations whereas species were formerly thus connected hence without rejecting the consideration of the present existence of intermediate gradations between any two forms we shall be led to weigh more carefully and to value higher the actual amount of difference between them it is quite possible that forms now generally acknowledged to be merely varieties may hereafter be thought worthy of specific names as with the primrose and cowslip and in this case scientific and common language will come into accordance in short we shall have to treat species in the same manner as those naturalists treat genera who admit that genera are merely artificial combinations 486 made for convenience this may not be a cheering prospect but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species the other and more general departments of natural history will rise greatly in interest the terms used by naturalists of affinity relationship community of type paternity morphology adaptive characters rudimentary and aborted organs c will cease to be metaphorical and will have a plain signification when we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship as at something wholly beyond his comprehension when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a history when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances each useful to the possessor nearly in the same way as when we look at any great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour the experience the reason and even the blunders of numerous workmen when we thus view each organic being how far more interesting i speak from experience will the study of natural history become a grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened on the causes and laws of variation on correlation of growth on the effects of use and disuse on the direct action of external conditions and so forth the study of domestic productions will rise immensely in value a new variety raised by man will be a more important and interesting subject for study than one more species added to the infinitude of already recorded species our classifications will come to be as far as they can be so made genealogies and will then truly give what may be called the plan of creation the rules for classifying will no doubt become simpler when we have a definite object in view we possess no 487 pedigrees or armorial bearings and we have to discover and trace the many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies by characters of any kind which have long been inherited rudimentary organs will speak infallibly with respect to the nature of long lost structures species and groups of species which are called aberrant and which may fancifully be called living fossils will aid us in forming a picture of the ancient forms of life embryology will reveal to us the structure in some degree obscured of the prototypes of each great class when we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species and all the closely allied species of most genera have within a not very remote period descended from one parent and have migrated from some one birthplace and when we better know the many means of migration then by the light which geology now throws and will continue to throw on former changes of climate and of the level of the land we shall surely be enabled to trace in an admirable manner the former migrations of the inhabitants of the whole world even at present by comparing the differences of the inhabitants of the sea on the opposite sides of a continent and the nature of the various inhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent means of immigration some light can be thrown on ancient geography the noble science of geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record the crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be looked at as a well filled museum but as a poor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals the accumulation of each great fossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on an unusual concurrence of circumstances and the blank intervals between the successive stages as having been of vast duration but we shall 488 be able to gauge with some security the duration of these intervals by a comparison of the preceding and succeeding organic forms we must be cautious in attempting to correlate as strictly contemporaneous two formations which include few identical species by the general succession of their forms of life as species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes and not by miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes and as the most important of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions namely the mutual relation of organism to organism the improvement of one being entailing the improvement or the extermination of others it follows that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive formations probably serves as a fair measure of the lapse of actual time a number of species however keeping in a body might remain for a long period unchanged whilst within this same period several of these species by migrating into new countries and coming into competition with foreign associates might become modified so that we must not overrate the accuracy of organic change as a measure of time during early periods of the earth s history when the forms of life were probably fewer and simpler the rate of change was probably slower and at the first dawn of life when very few forms of the simplest structure existed the rate of change may have been slow in an extreme degree the whole history of the world as at present known although of a length quite incomprehensible by us will hereafter be recognised as a mere fragment of time compared with the ages which have elapsed since the first creature the progenitor of innumerable extinct and living descendants was created in the distant future i see open fields for far more 489 important researches psychology will be based on a new foundation that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the view that each species has been independently created to my mind it accords better with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the creator that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitants of the world should have been due to secondary causes like those determining the birth and death of the individual when i view all beings not as special creations but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the silurian system was deposited they seem to me to become ennobled judging from the past we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit its unaltered likeness to a distant futurity and of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped shows that the greater number of species of each genus and all the species of many genera have left no descendants but have become utterly extinct we can so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretel that it will be the common and widely spread species belonging to the larger and dominant groups which will ultimately prevail and procreate new and dominant species as all the living forms of life are the lineal descendants of those which lived long before the silurian epoch we may feel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never once been broken and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equally inappreciable length and as natural selection works 490 solely by and for the good of each being all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection it is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank clothed with many plants of many kinds with birds singing on the bushes with various insects flitting about and with worms crawling through the damp earth and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms so different from each other and dependent on each other in so complex a manner have all been produced by laws acting around us these laws taken in the largest sense being growth with reproduction inheritance which is almost implied by reproduction variability from the indirect and direct action of the external conditions of life and from use and disuse a ratio of increase so high as to lead to a struggle for life and as a consequence to natural selection entailing divergence of character and the extinction of less improved forms thus from the war of nature from famine and death the most exalted object which we are capable of conceiving namely the production of the higher animals directly follows there is grandeur in this view of life with its several powers having been originally breathed by the creator into a few forms or into one and that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity from so simple a beginning
